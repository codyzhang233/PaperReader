    "abstract": "The existing deepfake detection methods have reached a bottleneck in generalizing to unseen forgeries and manipulation approaches. Based on the observation that the deepfake detectors exhibit a preference for overfitting specific primary regions in input, this paper enhances the generalization capability from a novel regularization perspective. This can be simply achieved by augmenting the images through primary region removal, thereby preventing the detector from over-relying on data bias. Our method consists of two stages, namely the static localization for primary region maps, as well as the dynamic exploitation of primary region masks. The proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into different backbones without affecting their inference efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments over five widely used deepfake datasets - DFDC, DF-1.0, Celeb-DF, WildDF, and FFIW with seven backbones. Our method demonstrates an average performance improvement of 6% across different backbones and performs competitively with several state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining ray-tracing (RT) and full-wave numerical analysis to evaluate and optimize reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in deterministic channels. Unlike traditional methods relying on statistical models, our approach integrates RT for deterministic channel mapping and finite element method (FEM)-based simulations to assess RIS impacts in realistic, site-specific scenarios. A non-diagonal impedance matrix is formed to link channel transfer functions to RIS tunable load impedances, accounting for mutual coupling between unit cells and enabling precise optimization for enhanced communication performance. A varactor-based RIS operating in the sub-6 GHz frequency band is designed and fabricated, with extensive simulations and real-world measurements conducted in single-input single-output (SISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) scenarios. A measurement-based closed-loop optimization process further refines RIS configurations. Results demonstrate substantial signal strength improvements, with strong agreement between simulations and measurements, confirming the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method for advanced RIS-enabled communication systems."

    "abstract": "Model quantization is an effective method that can improve communication efficiency in federated learning (FL). The existing FL quantization protocols almost stay at the level of post-training quantization (PTQ), which comes at the cost of large quantization loss, especially in the setting of low-bits quantization. In this work, we propose a FL quantization training strategy to reduce the impact of quantization on model quality. Specifically, we first apply quantization-aware training (QAT) to FL (QAT-FL), which reduces quantization distortion by adding a fake-quantization module to the model so that the model could perceive future quantization during training. The convergence guarantee of the QAT-FL algorithm is established under certain assumptions. On the basis of the QAT-FL algorithm, we extend the discussion of non-uniform quantization and the adaptive algorithm, so that the model can adaptively adjust the parametric distribution and the number of quantization bits to reduce the amount of traffic in training. Experimental results based on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets show that QAT-FL has advantages in terms of training loss and model inference accuracy, and adaptive-bits quantization of QAT-FL also greatly improves communication efficiency."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the mechatronic design and implementation of a hybrid-driven disc-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (HD-AUV). The hybrid-driven system integrates a buoyancy adjustment system and propeller thrusters, enabling the HD-AUV to achieve both high maneuverability motion and energy-efficient gliding. These capabilities correspond to two distinct motion modes: AUV mode and glider mode. In AUV mode, the HD-AUV leverages the rotational symmetry of its disc-shaped design to achieve four degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) motion control. This configuration, supported by four propeller thrusters, facilitates high-maneuverability actions, including fixed-point hovering and in-place turning. In glider mode, the integration of rotatable dorsal fins and horizontal propeller thrusters enables the HD-AUV to transition seamlessly between diving and ascending phases without the conventional mass-shifting mechanisms used in torpedo-type gliders. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the steady glide performance of the HD-AUV, focusing on lift-to-drag ratios and hydrodynamic coefficients. Comprehensive pool experiments, encompassing multi-DOF maneuvers and gentle gliding, demonstrate the exceptional locomotion capabilities of the HD-AUV and validate the accuracy of the proposed dynamic model. These hybrid motion modes hold significant promise for underwater operations in complex seafloor environments."

    "abstract": "Parallel robots are increasingly used in automation thanks to their high stiffness, accuracy, and reduced moving inertia. Among them, the Biglide parallel robot offers a promising architecture for material handling tasks. However, transporting liquid-filled containers with such systems introduces significant challenges due to sloshing dynamics. Sloshing can degrade positioning accuracy, prolong settling time, and even cause spillage, making effective vibration suppression essential. In this study, Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) is applied to the Biglide robot to ensure precise trajectory tracking under uncertainties. With its real-time disturbance estimation and compensation capability, ADRC improves both tracking accuracy and system stability. To further attenuate sloshing-induced vibrations, particular emphasis is placed on the Equal-Time-and-Magnitude (ETM4) input shaper, which provides strong robustness to modeling errors while maintaining excellent vibration suppression. For comparison, conventional shapers such as Zero Vibration (ZV) and Zero Vibration and Derivative (ZVD) are also implemented. Simulation results confirm that the combined ADRC–IS scheme, especially with ETM4, delivers a reliable and effective solution for vibration-sensitive liquid transport in parallel robotic systems."

    "abstract": "We propose SNI-SLAM++, a tightly-coupled semantic SLAM system utilizing neural implicit representation, that simultaneously performs accurate semantic mapping, high-quality surface reconstruction, and robust camera tracking. Our system tightly integrates visual appearance, geometry, and semantics through five key components: (i) We introduce hierarchical semantic representation to allow multi-level semantic comprehension for top-down structured semantic mapping of the scene. (ii) To fully utilize the correlation between multiple attributes of the environment, we integrate appearance, geometry and semantic features through cross-attention for feature collaboration. This strategy enables a more multifaceted understanding of the environment, thereby allowing SNI-SLAM++ to remain robust even when single attribute is defective. (iii) We design an internal fusion-based decoder to obtain semantic, RGB, and Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) values from multi-level features for accurate decoding. (iv) We introduce a semantics-coupled tracking framework that tightly incorporates semantic constraints for camera pose estimation in neural implicit SLAM. This framework leverages the multi-view consistency of semantics to construct a pose graph and perform semantic loop closure optimization, enabling robust tracking. (v) We propose a feature loss to update the scene representation at the feature level. Compared with low-level losses such as RGB loss and depth loss, our feature loss is capable of guiding the network optimization on a higher level. Our SNI-SLAM++ demonstrates superior performance over all recent visual SLAM methods in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy on the datasets of Replica, ScanNet, TUM-RGBD, and ScanNet++, while also showing excellent capabilities in accurate semantic segmentation and 3D semantic mapping."

    "abstract": "The presence of clutter in ground penetrating radar (GPR) images obscures or distorts the responses of subsurface targets, significantly impacting the accuracy of detecting and identifying targets. Current clutter removal approaches often result in residual clutter or deformation of target responses, especially when confronted with intricate and uneven clutter in real-world GPR signatures. To address this issue in clutter removal under realistic conditions, this research introduces the Spatial Attention-based Convoluted Gazelle Neural Network (SACGNN). SACGNN is trained on large-scale dataset designed to reflect real-time conditions and incorporates a residual block into its spatial attention-based architecture. This integration enhances its ability to suppress clutter and restore target reflections on surfaces like homogeneous, rough, water, and grass surfaces. Tuning the SACGNN using the gazelle optimization algorithm excels in clutter removal by offering faster convergence, maintaining a balanced exploration-exploitation trade-off, and enhancing robustness across various data patterns."

    "abstract": "Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) utilize alternating fields (AC fields) within 100–300 kHz and electric field strengths above 1 V/cm for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. However, the electric field is often reduced to a relatively low value (below 1 V/cm) due to the unavoidable thermal effects induced by Joule heating on the patient's skin. Objective: This study proposes a pulsed TTFields to enhance therapy effect, while reducing thermal effects. Methods: This work designed a TTFields generator to output 200 kHz AC fields. Cell experiments were conducted to compare cell viability between pulsed and conventional TTFields. A gel platform was used to measure temperature rises under clinical parameters of TTFields. A realistic head model with a tumor was simulated to analyze electric field and thermal distributions. Results: The designed generator can output two separate TTFields signals with 100 V voltage amplitude and 2000 mA current amplitude, meeting clinical trial requirements. Pulsed TTFields (10% duty cycle, 3.37 V/cm) achieved significantly lower cell viability (53.07%) than continuous TTFields (1.07 V/cm, 84.76%) while maintaining similar temperature rises. Gel experiments confirmed comparable temperature rises for both protocols. Simulations on a realistic head model demonstrated that pulsed TTFields achieved broader tumor coverage (electric field >1 V/cm) compared to continuous TTFields under equivalent thermal conditions. Conclusion: Pulsed TTFields can generate higher electric fields in targeted regions, significantly inhibiting cell proliferation while reducing thermal risks compared to continuous TTFields. Significance: The proposed pulsed TTFields may provide an optimized treatment method to enhance GBM therapy efficacy."

Low impedance mismatch and consistent radiation patterns featuring high beam symmetry, polarization purity, and directivity with low side lobes are achieved over 6-18.5 GHz. This performance is accomplished by deploying several geometrical modifications including tapered termination of the helix, increased wire thickness, and a dual pitch angle structure. The antenna is designed for and manufactured with the digital light processing (DLP) three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. DLP 3D printing enables monolithic integration of an air-filled coaxial filter line which also mechanically supports the helical filaments and ensures smooth transition to connector. Excellent agreement between measurements and simulations demonstrates the robustness of the proposed design and its utility for diverse applications across commercial and defense sectors."

    "abstract": "The smart skin antenna integrates with the carrier height, and polarization provides refined recognition capabilities, both of which combine to achieve maximum aperture and improved degrees of freedom. However, the beam performance of skin antenna depends on strain measurement data, and real-time monitoring will introduce errors, causing steering vector mismatches that degrade beam performance and polarization accuracy. To address this challenge, an online optimization method is proposed to achieve robust polarized beamforming in smart skin antenna array. The strain measurement data is used to develop a reconfigurable antenna model online via the modal method. Building on this foundation, the improved feature subspace (IFS) method estimates the actual steering vector in real-time. The estimated steering vector is then integrated with second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm to achieve online optimal robust polarized beamforming for smart skin array. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method not only enables real-time reconstruction of the optimal robust polarized beamforming but also significantly improves the overall performance of the smart skin array. The optimizations in beamwidth, pattern gain, and polarization matching exceed those of previous studies, highlighting the engineering potential of smart skin arrays in robust polarized beamforming."

This paper proposes a steganographic technique based on an hybridaztion of two algorithms, Genetic algorithm and Firefly algorithm, aimed at optimizing the embedding process to achieve high imperceptibility.

    "abstract": "This study takes a close look at eight behavioral dimensions of leadership within what we might call a hybrid organizational reality. The dimensions are grouped under two big orientations, though in practice the boundaries are not always so clear. On the one hand, task-oriented leadership covers issues like performance management, autonomy, digital integration, and, of course, innovation. On the other hand, relational-oriented leadership deals more with support, cohesion, spiritual guidance, and what I described as emotional regulation through a certain strategic distance. Methodologically, the research did not follow a straight line. It started with a qualitative phase, based on semi-structured interviews with Moroccan leaders from very different sectors, and only later moved to a more structured survey for quantitative validation. The interviews were analyzed thematically, sometimes with overlapping categories, to bring out behaviors that feel rooted in local culture. The survey phase helped check whether these patterns hold up statistically, giving evidence of both consistency and validity. Taken together, these steps led to a model of hybrid leadership adapted to Moroccan sociocultural realities. It combines elements that look universal with others that are very specific to local practices. The model does not claim to be perfect, but it does aim to offer useful insights for developing leadership in today’s complex, multicultural, and increasingly digital work environments. It seems especially relevant for organizations trying to juggle hybrid work setups, intergenerational dynamics, and cultural pluralism."

Key degradation features are first characterized by ten time-frequency domain statistical indicators. Next, the training set labels, corresponding to the full lifecycle of the bearings, are defined in chronological order. Finally, the degradation features are fed into the LSTM and CNN-LSTM models to compare their predictive performance. Experimental results reveal that the CNN-LSTM model significantly outperforms the standard LSTM in high-noise scenarios due to the convolutional layer's ability to extract robust spatial features, despite incurring longer training times. In contrast, the LSTM model demonstrates more efficient training under low-noise conditions and exhibits reduced fluctuations in later-stage predictions. These findings illustrate the matching law between model characteristics and operational conditions: while CNN-LSTM is more suitable for industrial scenarios characterized by high noise and complex features, LSTM is preferable for real-time prediction tasks with limited computational resources."

By simulating the cladding process under different curvature radii, it is found that the temperature peak is strongly positively correlated with curvature. There is a critical radius threshold in the cladding process of cylindrical cladding matrix. This model provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of laser remanufacturing process for high-curvature parts (such as shafts and bearing housings).

    "abstract": "This paper sets out the creation of a dual convolutional neural network system that combines both one-dimensional and two-dimensional deep learning models. The 1D CNN takes individual pixel spectral data to build essential spectral features while the 2D CNN examines local area pixels to extract spatial information. The system obtains complete knowledge of hyperspectral data by combining the output signals from both neural network branches. The Pavia University benchmark dataset tests demonstrate that the hybrid 1D2D CNN architecture outperforms conventional machine learning approaches, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), in terms of classification accuracy. Our method outperforms KNN by using both spectral and spatial information and surpasses SVM and RF because it employs two separate branches for spatial feature extraction. The fusion methodology leads to better classification precision and enhanced resistance to spectral noise as well as improved outcomes for class-overlapping situations. The results show that deep learning combined with spectral-spatial feature fusion effectively maps hyperspectral land cover."

This study presents a hybrid Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) framework combining the global search capability of Genetic Algorithms (GA) with the local refinement of Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). To reduce computational cost, an ensemble of surrogate models, Kriging, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Radial Basis Function (RBF), is used to estimate failure probabilities at each step. An active learning approach further improves accuracy by focusing evaluations on critical regions. This GA+SQP scheme enables efficient and robust navigation of complex, highly non-convex design spaces while ensuring target reliability levels. Applied to RC bridge components, the method identifies optimized geometries that minimize material use without compromising serviceability or structural reliability over long-term performance. The proposed approach offers a practical solution for designing durable and cost-effective structures, particularly when accounting for long-term degradation effects and uncertainties in structural behavior."

    "abstract": "This paper details the design and implementation of an embedded, real-time localization system based on a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphone array to address the demand for real-time detection and localization of transient sound events within complex acoustic environments. A novel transient sound detection algorithm is proposed, integrating a dynamic threshold with a four-state finite state machine (FSM) to enhance detection robustness under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratios and non-stationary noise. This objective is accomplished by dynamically updating the noise baseline with an exponentially weighted moving average model and utilizing the FSM state transition mechanism to characterize the waveform evolution of transient sounds. For sound source localization, the system utilizes the generalized cross-correlation with phase transform algorithm to estimate the time difference of arrival. Through acceleration strategies, including the selection of optimal microphone pairs and the pre-computation of a constant matrix, the computational complexity is significantly diminished while maintaining localization accuracy. The system is architected around an STM32H743 microcontroller, which integrates an 8-channel MEMS microphone array for synchronous data acquisition, and enables wireless communication with a host computer via an ESP8266 module. The experimental results indicate that the proposed transient sound detection algorithm exhibits excellent performance in non-stationary noise environments. The accelerated sound source localization method has been shown to achieve effective localization with an average single-localization time of merely 26 milliseconds, thereby satisfying the real-time processing demands of the embedded system. This research provides a low-cost, high-efficiency technical solution for the monitoring of transient sound events in scenarios such as security surveillance and industrial equipment anomaly detection."

This paper considers the maximum demand charge pricing rules and analyzes the potential of energy storage deployment in reducing peak load and minimizing demand charges. An optimal energy storage configuration strategy is proposed based on a two-layer decision-making model, where the upper-layer model optimizes capacity and power ratings to maximize lifecycle benefits, and the lower-layer model determines daily charging/discharging strategies based on upper-layer results to achieve short-term profit maximization.

    "abstract": "In response to the increased randomness and volatility in power grid operation caused by the rising penetration rate of new energy under the \"dual carbon\" goals, a data-driven decoupling and dimensionality reduction technology for distribution network aggregators is proposed. Firstly, the limitations of traditional power grid dispatching models in terms of new energy and DC transmission are pointed out, highlighting the risk of insufficient regulation resources and \"hollowing out\" in the receiving end power grid, and emphasizing the urgency of integrating distributed resources into the dispatching system. Then, flexibility resources are efficiently managed in the form of clusters based on the power supply range of substations, and the flexibility of clusters is quantitatively evaluated to ensure the coordinated utilization and optimized operation of resources. To address the computational efficiency bottleneck caused by time-coupled constraints in power system optimal dispatching, a data-driven decoupling and dimensionality reduction method is innovatively proposed. This method learns the dimensionality reduction constraints from historical or simulated optimal operation strategy data through reverse optimization, effectively reducing the constraint dimension while maintaining the integrity of the original constraints. Finally, the significant effect of the proposed method in reducing the constraint dimension and its good approximation of the original constraints are verified through case studies, providing an efficient and feasible solution for power system optimal dispatching."

Currently, common traversability analysis methods generally rely on single sensor data, which cannot fully integrate the ground attributes and geometric features of the terrain in off-road environments. This limitation results in weak anti-interference ability and poor robustness in environment perception, thereby affecting the traversability analysis performance. Hence, this paper proposes an innovative approach for solving above challenges. Firstly, it improves the robustness of the environment sensing process by fusing data from multiple LiDAR sensors. Then, it achieves sensing of the road-ahead ground attributes via road-surface semantic segmentation. Finally, it constructs a localized, dense traversability map to visually analyze the road-ahead. The experimental results show that the elevation maps and traversable layers generated by the proposed method are improved in terms of detail and accuracy. This helps unmanned vehicles achieve more effective and stable perception ability and navigation basis in off-road or complex environments. This method demonstrates outstanding traversability analysis performance and can accurately analyze the road status."

    "abstract": "Nonlinearities affect motor operation, particularly at sensitive working points and low speeds. Although various compensation techniques have been proposed to address these effects, it is commonly assumed that the impact of shunt-based current measurement is negligible. This paper investigates the role of shunt measurement in introducing distortions during low-speed PMSM operation, analyzing single-shunt and dual-shunt configurations. Switched-model simulations reveal that inverter switching non-idealities dominate at low loads, but at rated loads, shunt resistance becomes a critical factor, significantly influencing harmonic distortion and system stability. In dual-shunt setups, a DC offset of approximately $0.85 \\%$ and a dominant second harmonic at $1.5 \\%$ of the fundamental were observed, indicating phase imbalance. Moreover, a suitable selection of shunt resistance values is shown to mitigate these effects and reduce the reliance on complex software-based compensation methods such as wide-bandwidth current controllers. For single-shunt configurations, the analysis reveals a distinct increase in torque ripple, reaching approximately 120 mNm, in addition to the appearance of strong even-order harmonics dominating the harmonic spectrum. These results emphasize the importance of considering the measurement architecture when designing PMSM systems for low-speed applications to achieve improved stability, reduced torque ripple, and enhanced overall performance."

This paper proposes a multi-view SAR images high-precision fusion positioning method based on the error propagation model. Firstly, the two-dimensional systematic positioning error between two different viewpoint images is estimated based on the equivalent equation of the real geographic location of the homonymous point. Then, different viewpoint SAR images positioning error propagation model is established, and multiple estimates are fused with weights to derive an accurate estimation of the positioning error across multi-view SAR images. Finally, by compensating the two-dimensional system positioning errors in each view angle SAR image, a precise correspondence between pixel coordinates and geographic coordinates can be established to realize high-precision positioning of SAR images. Validation experiments are carried out using multi-view airborne SAR images, and the results show that the method can realize high-precision positioning of multi-view SAR images without ground control points(GCPs)."

The study finds that nearly 66 percent of the general moroccan FDI is directed toward the CFA region, highlighting its strategic importance. Despite the CFA franc’s peg to the euro, the research uncovers that persistent exchange rate volatility, coupled with regulatory divergences and macroeconomic uncertainties, poses significant financial risks for cross border investments. In the banking sector, these challenges manifest in eroded profit margins due to heightened currency risks, increased compliance costs, and intensified market competition. The analysis employs rigorous econometric models to quantify the actual impact of currency fluctuations on profitability, revealing that even marginal increases in volatility can substantially diminish profit margins. The findings underscore the need for proactive risk management strategies, such as effective hedging and coordinated policy measures, to mitigate these risks and sustain the momentum of Morocco’s international expansion."

A model related to the UAV's visual region and sensor coverage area is established, considering the line-of-sight (LoS) obstruction caused by obstacles in urban environments. Bayesian theory is applied to update the global probability map, by employing dynamic occupancy grids to represent the probability of target presence and integrating sensor data from UAVs. To enhance detection speed, a consensus-based information fusion algorithm with state predictor is incorporated. Furthermore, an objective function for trajectory optimization is constructed by integrating cumulative probability and detection cost. Different typical target scenarios are designed, and UAV positions are dynamically adjusted using an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) within a model predictive control framework. Then, an obstacle configuration mechanism is proposed: when at least one UAV avoids obstacles, a strict constraint mechanism is applied; otherwise, a fuzzy constraint mechanism is utilized. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

PowerCause can automatically detect anomaly intervals, locate the source of phase unbalance using Granger causality test, back-search, and generate a list of potential root cause buses. It takes regulation measures for specific buses to alleviate the impact of the unbalance. This implements a closed-loop solution that handles the entire process from the occurrence of phase unbalance to its positioning, and finally, to active regulation. This study builds a closed-loop simulation environment based on the open distribution system simulator (OpenDSS) to enable autonomous and controllable unbalance injection, collect multidimensional bus metrics, including voltage and phase angle. The environment also includes causal analysis and active regulation modules for method verification. The proposed method demonstrates high accuracy in root cause location, efficient performance, and robustness against environmental influences such as measurement noise and data loss errors."

    "abstract": "When designed deliberately, data visualizations can become powerful persuasive tools, influencing viewers' opinions, values, and actions. While researchers have begun studying this issue (e.g., to evaluate the effects of persuasive visualization), we argue that a fundamental mechanism of persuasion resides in rhetorical construction, a perspective inadequately addressed in current visualization research. To fill this gap, we present a focused analysis of octopus maps, a visual genre that has maintained persuasive power across centuries and achieved significant social impact. Employing rhetorical schema theory, we collected and analyzed 90 octopus maps spanning from the 19th century to contemporary times. We closely examined how octopus maps implement their persuasive intents and constructed a design space that reveals how visual metaphors are strategically constructed and what common rhetorical strategies are applied to components such as maps, octopus imagery, and text. Through the above analysis, we also uncover a set of interesting findings. For instance, contrary to the common perception that octopus maps are primarily a historical phenomenon, our research shows that they remain a lively design convention in today's digital age. Additionally, while most octopus maps stem from Western discourse that views the octopus as an evil symbol, some designs offer alternative interpretations, highlighting the dynamic nature of rhetoric across different sociocultural settings. Lastly, drawing from the lessons provided by octopus maps, we discuss the associated ethical concerns of persuasive visualization."

To cope with this issue, we propose a Reliability-aware VNF service Provisioning (RVFP) approach for NFV-based networks via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL), where each VNF is hosted and backed up in appropriate hardware with reliability guarantees. Specifically, a novel MADRL-based framework for VNF placement is designed with two alternating optimization objectives, namely maximizing reliability and minimizing VNF instance failure probability, to incorporate diverse objective landscapes and encourage broader exploration within the solution space. Furthermore, two agent allocation strategies are developed to alternately arrange the tasks of collaborative agents for reliability-aware placement of VNFs in a parallel and cooperative manner. Besides, the newly-designed prioritized experience sampling, built on reward and sampling frequency, is used to better exploit valuable experiences for faster model training. Extensive simulation results obtained from various scenarios show that RVFP can significantly improve placement reliability and service acceptance ratios for VNF deployment compared with the state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel fuzzy logic-enhanced neuroadaptive sliding mode control (FLENNSMC) framework, developed for vehicular platoon systems subject to a confluence of challenges. Leveraging the synergistic integration of fuzzy logic’s interpretive strengths and neural networks’ adaptive learning capabilities, FLENNSMC effectively addresses nonlinear dynamics, stochastic disturbances, actuator faults, and stringent asymmetric spacing constraints. We propose a Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to structure the learning process and a fuzzy logic-enhanced RBFNN (FLERBFNN) for robust approximation of unknown functions, including unmodeled dynamics and fault signals. The controller design incorporates a fault-tolerant control mechanism for enhanced robustness, an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to strictly enforce spacing constraints, and a Nussbaum function to compensate for actuator faults with unknown directions. The fuzzy logic-enhanced structure allows for localized and efficient learning, which reduces computational burden and improves adaptation speed. Through a rigorous stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability analysis, we derive sufficient LMI-based conditions for the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of tracking errors in the mean square sense and guarantee a mixed H-infinity/passivity performance. Extensive simulations on a 2-D multilane vehicular platoon demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLENNSFC compared to conventional neuroadaptive control approaches, particularly highlighting the benefits of fuzzy logic in structuring the learning process and handling complex uncertainties.

However, in the presence of faulty or attacked nodes, even a small perturbation (or sharing false data) during the communication can lead to divergence of the solution. To address this issue, in this work we consider ADMM under the effect of Byzantine threat, where an unknown subset of nodes is subject to Byzantine attacks or faults. We propose Dynamically Weighted ADMM (DW-ADMM), a novel variant of ADMM that uses dynamic weights on the edges of the network, thus promoting resilient distributed optimization in settings without central coordination. We establish that the proposed method (i) produces a nearly identical solution to conventional ADMM in the error-free case, and (ii) guarantees a bounded solution with respect to the global minimizer, even under Byzantine threat. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using illustrative numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "Aircraft-like objects exhibit significant electromagnetic scattering in the meter-wave frequency range due to their inherent resonance effects. Traditional scattering cross-section (SCS) reduction techniques, such as shape optimization and radar-absorbing materials, often require large structural modifications to control meter-wave scattering, which inevitably affect the aerodynamic performance. This article proposes a novel reconfigurable capacitive loading technique based on characteristic mode cancellation. By strategically placing a small number of capacitive loadings on the surface of aircraft-like objects, dominant scattering modes are induced to cancel each other. The alternating direction method of multipliers is introduced to transform the non-convex scattering optimization problem into a two-step iterative process, which is incorporated with the characteristic mode analysis to efficiently determine the near-optimal capacitive loadings. An electronically reconfigurable loading network is then implemented to dynamically control the states of the capacitive loadings for wideband SCS reduction. Numerical results for a simplified aircraft-like object show a maximum monostatic SCS reduction of 44.0 dB and a maximum 10-dB SCS reduction fractional bandwidth of 9.5% over 84.0–120.0 MHz. A scaled prototype is designed, fabricated, and measured, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This configuration inherently eliminates the need for phase deviation compensation caused by digital system and filter delays. Experimental validation is conducted on a 20 kW IPMSM test platform under representative operating conditions.

    "abstract": "Wearable assistive devices that monitor muscle fatigue reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, enhance rehabilitation outcomes, and extend operational time by optimizing the power consumption of the device. This work proposes a muscle fatigue-aware controller (MFAC) for a semi-rigid knee exoskeleton. During an offline calibration phase, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to model the relationship between muscle activation (measured via EMG) and the corresponding joint moment and angle, enabling fatigue state estimation for the controller. The trained model then approximates muscle activation online using only joint states and moment derived from user’s kinematic data and ground reaction forces provided by the wearable device. The estimated muscle activation is used to assess the muscle fatigue state through a model-based fatigue evaluation module. Notably, EMG measurement is only required during the offline training in our approach, enabling EMG-free online estimation, which significantly enhances the feasibility for long-term mobile applications. Building on muscle fatigue and human-exoskeleton interaction models, we then developed an adaptive controller within a predictive control framework. The resulting optimization problem generates control signals that adjust assistance to reduce the fatigue progression. Two experiments validate the EMG-free fatigue estimation method and the integrated MFAC, demonstrating accurate muscle activation estimation and effective adaptive assistance based on the estimated fatigue state. Analysis of actuator power output reveals adaptivity in which the controller conserves energy during low muscle fatigue and progressively improves power output with increasing fatigue, suggesting a longer duration of the device with a fixed battery capacity."

In recognition of the fact that static confidence cutoffs either introduce noisy labels or restrict learning excessively, adaptive thresholds derived from Flexible Confidence (FlexCon) variants are applied to govern pseudo-label inclusion. Additionally, three feature representations-original, IPCA, and random projection-are compared to ensure equal trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational overhead. By utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data, this design balances class imbalance while dynamically adjusting labeling criteria to enhance the performance of multi-class anomaly detection in large-scale IDS."

To address these issues, we propose a Tri-perspective Multi-view Fusion and Classification (TMFC) framework that systematically unifies consistency, complementarity, and diversity principles. TMFC consolidates multi-view data into a meta-view through feature concatenation and generates diverse latent views via random mapping, preserving structural information while reducing redundancy. These latent views are optimized through a unified formulation that balances alignment, information enrichment, and feature distinctiveness, reformulated as a semi-definite programming problem and efficiently solved using the reformulation-linearization technique with a cutting plane algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMFC’s superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, normalized mutual information, and adjusted rand index."

    "abstract": "A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the potential solutions for real applications on edge devices. Recently, TickNets have been formed by allocating FullResidual Point-Depth-Point (FR-PDP) blocks in a multiple of tick-shape backbones. However, there can be a lack of diverse information since only the FR-PDP-based features have been exploited in those backbones. This shortcoming can be the cause of their modest performance in several circumstances, while still taking a high computational cost. To mitigate this issue, a transition layer is proposed to exploit the transitional patterns for learning diverse information in TickNets. Simply, a pointwise convolution is embedded as a hooking connection for pointwise-based features instead of the FR-PDP-based features that have been transferred between two basic tick-shape backbones. It can be seen that addressing such a transition layer would lead to two practical benefits: i) extracting diverse patterns for the learning process; and ii) a significant reduction of model complexity thanks to the lightweight pointwise operation. Experiments for image classification on benchmark datasets have validated the efficiency of our proposal. Particularly, with less computational complexity, the proposed transitional patterns have boosted about 1.2% rate on Stanford Dogs versus the original TickNets, while it is the same on CIFAR-10/100. It could be an alternative solution for TickNets in real applications. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/DevHieuLC/TickNetSLM."

Therefore, based on high-density discrete wavelet transform (HD-DWT) and fractional time-frequency analysis, the fractional high-density discrete wavelet transform (FH-DWT) is constructed in this paper. However, when using the FH-DWT for fault diagnosis, the diagnosis effectiveness is greatly influenced by the decomposition level. Therefore, how to adaptively determine the decomposition levels in FH-DWT has become an urgent problem. Based on the principle that multi-scale symbolic dynamic entropy (MSDE) can measure the similarity between components at different scales, a method for adaptively determining the optimal decomposition level is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, the MSDE value in each layer can be used to measure the similarity between low-frequency and mid-frequency components, and the decomposition level can be adaptively determined. The results of simulation show that the FH-DWT based on MSDE is superior to traditional HD-DWT, and can adaptively determine the optimal decomposition level in FH-DWT. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed method is verified by two experimental cases further."

    "abstract": "In-band full-duplex (IBFD) operation in multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems faces significant challenges due to self-interference (SI). The cancellation complexity of SI grows quadratically with the number of antennas, posing a critical scalability challenge for 6 G and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. Existing self-interference cancellation (SIC) techniques, including both model-based and recent deep learning approaches, typically operate on a perantenna basis and thus inherit this prohibitive complexity growth. This paper proposes a novel beam-based deep learning framework that fundamentally overcomes this limitation. By operating in the beam domain, our method models the interference at each receiver as a linear combination of the transmit beam signals, allowing the neural network to learn the end-to-end system effects without explicit channel estimation. The key advantage of this approach is that the network's complexity only scales with the number of beams, making it independent of the number of transmit antennas and highly suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves over 33 dB of SIC, with performance robust to increasing number of transmit antennas. This beam-domain approach offers a scalable and effective solution for practical IBFD implementation in future wireless networks."

The architecture encompasses three sequential modules: data preprocessing, GBDT-based feature selection, and BiGRU-based training. After signal acquisition and preprocessing, GBDT is employed to quantify feature importance, through which key wear-relevant features are retained and dimensionality is reduced, thereby improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, the BiGRU network is utilized to capture temporal evolutions of the selected features and to classify wear states accurately, leading to markedly improved monitoring precision and generalization capability. Validation on both the public PHM 2010 dataset and the in-house EX dataset demonstrates training accuracies of 98.9 % and 97.8 %, respectively, confirming the validity and robustness of the proposed framework."

Although traditional error compensation methods can effectively reduce errors, they have problems such as high cost, complex system, and high power consumption. To this end, this paper proposes an error correction method based on SVM algorithm to predict and correct the phase error caused by excitation current.

    "abstract": "Fault diagnosis technology plays a pivotal role in ensuring production safety and enhancing the operational efficiency of industrial equipment. However, traditional fault diagnosis methods often exhibit limited feature extraction capabilities and poor generalization when applied to real-world scenarios characterized by scarce labeled data and complex, variable working conditions. These constraints result in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep transfer learning-based fault diagnosis framework that integrates Multi-Scale feature extraction and Multi-Layer domain adaptation (MS-ML). Initially, vibration signals are processed using a Multi-Scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract hierarchical features that capture both localized details and global patterns across multiple scales. This architecture significantly enhances the model's capacity to identify complex fault signatures. Subsequently, a Multi-Layer domain adaptation strategy is introduced to minimize distribution discrepancies between source and target domain data, thereby improving the model's generalization performance under diverse operating conditions. The proposed method is rigorously validated on two benchmark datasets: the Jiangnan University dataset and the Paderborn University dataset. Comparative experiments with existing approaches demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves superior diagnostic accuracy but also exhibits strong cross-domain adaptability, maintaining stable performance in transfer scenarios. These findings provide both theoretical support and technical advancement for the development of intelligent diagnostic systems in industrial applications."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of psychiatric diseases poses a significant challenge for clinicians due to its high complexity, symptom subjectivity, and the prevalence of comorbidities. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in the general medical field, a unified framework specifically for the complex reasoning tasks in psychiatry remains a gap. This paper introduces Psych-R1, an LLM designed to unify psychiatric disease reasoning, motivated by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Psych-R1 employs a pure RL paradigm, combining a rule-based hybrid task reward function with multi-objective reward optimization. This allows Psych-R1 to generate concise and verifiable reasoning chains, effectively handling a variety of psychiatric question-answering (QA) tasks, from multiple-choice questions (MCQ) to complex open-ended text generation. Experimental results show that Psych-R1 significantly outperforms open-source general and medical models of similar scale on several challenging psychiatric benchmarks. Furthermore, Psych-R1 demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks."

    "abstract": "As a critical component of rotating machinery, the degradation indicator (DI) and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of bearings are crucial for the safe operation of equipment. This paper proposes a physics-informed method for constructing bearing degradation indicators and predicting RUL. By embedding the physical laws governing the bearing's service process, the method enhances the physical interpretability of the degradation indicator and the robustness of the prediction model. In the construction of the degradation indicator, an exponential physical equation describing the evolution of bearing crack length over time is established based on Paris' law. A loss function incorporating physical constraints is designed to compel the deep learning network to extract features that conform to the material damage accumulation law. In the RUL prediction stage, a time-series constraint loss function is introduced to ensure that the prediction results align with the physical law of \"remaining life monotonically decreasing with time,\" mitigating the black-box characteristics of data-driven models. Experiments utilize the PHM2012 dataset, constructing a physics-informed degradation indicator network and a physics-informed remaining useful life prediction network. The results demonstrate that the degradation indicator constructed by the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical features in terms of trend and monotonicity, and the accuracy of the prediction results is significantly improved."

    "abstract": "The trend toward minimizing DC-link capacitance in electric drive systems promotes higher reliability and facilitates the adoption of durable film capacitors. Nonetheless, this reduction in capacitance can induce instability, primarily due to the negative incremental impedance effect associated with constant power loads. To address this, a voltage regulation strategy based on Modulated Model Predictive Control (M2PC) and active damping via voltage injection is introduced. The proposed controller predicts future DC-link voltage behavior using a discrete-time model and counteracts deviations by adjusting the applied inverter voltage accordingly. Compared to conventional PI-based voltage injection damping methods, the proposed M2PC-based strategy provides enhanced damping effectiveness, reduced voltage ripple, and lower harmonic content. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme’s ability to enhance both stability and transient response in systems with reduced DC-link capacitance."

Given that maintenance personnel working in high-voltage substations are susceptible to strong electric fields, which can cause electric field distortion and safety hazards, this study employs electric field simulation analysis to systematically examine the electric field distribution when maintenance personnel are engaged in equipotential operations. The results indicate that the neck, hands, and feet of the workers are the areas with the most significant electric field distortion, and noticeable distortion also occurs on both sides of the chest.

Traditional object detection models, while effective, often exhibit limitations in handling complex and dynamic driving scenarios, particularly inaccurate obstacle detection and estimating the distance to obstacles to provide timely warnings. To address these challenges, state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks such as YOLOv8 and Detectron2, have shown promising advancements in object detection accuracy and distance estimation. However, the comparative performance of these frameworks in terms of key evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score remains underexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of YOLOv8 and Detectron2, for obstacle inference and distance estimation tasks in autonomous driving systems. Our results indicate that YOLOv8 achieves a Precision of 88%, Recall of 88%, and F1 Score of 88%, demonstrating robust and balanced detection performance. In contrast, Detectron2 achieves a slightly higher Precision of 89% but lower Recall and F1 Score at 84% and 86%, respectively, indicating a trade-off between detection accuracy and sensitivity. The proposed distance estimation algorithm has MAE of about 80 cm. These findings underscore the nuanced performance characteristics of YOLOv8 and Detectron2 when deployed in autonomous driving environments, providing valuable insights for selecting appropriate frameworks based on specific detection and distance estimation priorities."

This healthcare service offers several advantages, such as improving patients’ quality of life and reducing both hospital congestion and the increasing costs of the healthcare system. However, not all patients can access HHC due to various medical, logistical, and organizational constraints and decisions. HHC services require multiple decision-making processes at different levels of care—before, during, and after patient admission. The admission process itself is complex and depends on several factors, including the patient’s medical condition, the suitability of the home environment for care delivery, the availability of healthcare professionals, etc. Additionally, uncertainty plays a critical role in decision-making, affecting medical staff, patients, and their families. In this paper, we propose a structured framework for HHC services, detailing the system’s organization and decision-making processes at different planning levels and periods of care. We also provide an overview of the patient admission process and review existing approaches in the literature that address HHC service challenges and decisions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on current limitations and potential future research directions."

Two mathematical models—the Double Diode Model (DDM) and the Four-Diode Model (FDM)—are employed under the constraint of relying solely on datasheet information provided by manufacturers. A custom fitness function, based on the minimization of the error between computed and datasheet I–V characteristics, guides the optimization process. The proposed FO-PSO approach is benchmarked against conventional optimization techniques using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. Results indicate that FO-PSO achieves a notably lower RMSE, particularly when applied to the FDM, reaching values below 0.08. This demonstrates its superior capability in capturing the true behavior of PV modules compared to traditional methods. The methodology offers a significant advancement in PV modelling, enabling more accurate representations of commercial PV panels without requiring extensive empirical data. FO-PSO applied to the FDM proves to be a competitive and robust tool for PV parameter extraction, with strong potential for future applications in advanced PV modelling, including multi-junction modules and smart grid integration."

Nevertheless, the extraction of high-resolution features frequently results in significant computing complexity, which contradicts the low-complexity demands of real-time systems. To address this difficulty, conventional methodologies often employ an autoencoder design that compresses frequency data to diminish computing demands and encapsulates global information within the bottleneck. Nonetheless, these models frequently neglect the significance of sub-band and cross-band parameters in speech signal processing. To overcome this issue, we offer a real-time model that efficiently utilizes both sub-band and cross-band information at high resolution, while adhering to the autoencoder architecture to meet real-time requirements. The suggested model demonstrates exceptional performance across multiple speech quality metrics, attaining a SIG score of 3.49 and an OVRL score of 3.01 on the blind test set of the ICASSP 2024 Speech Signal Improvement Challenge, with a real-time factor (RTF) of 0.30."

However, existing RUL prediction methods often rely on a single-stage degenerate model, which limits their accuracy. In addition, conventional data-driven approaches require extensive computational costs due to the extensive quantification of monitoring data. To solve these problems, an adaptive multi-stage degradation framework based on sparse Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed in this paper. The degradation process is divided into multiple stages based on change points, whose number is determined by the Elbow Method and the change points are adaptively selected from Binary Segmentation (BS), the Degradation Angle (DA) index, and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) through error assessments at each stage. A degradation indicator and sparse GPR model with matched kernel function selected based on trend variations is constructed for each stage. The proposed method is validated on both a simulated signal and a PHM challenge bearing dataset. Comparative experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over alternative models."

The system leverages the interpretability and decision strength of GBM on tabular network features while capturing temporal patterns from sequential traffic using the 1D-CNN, enhanced by a channel-level attention mechanism. A score-level fusion strategy ensures optimal synergy between the models for final classification. Extensive experiments on the CIC-IDS2018 dataset demonstrate that FusedBoostNet outperforms classical machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble-based techniques, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.8%, an F1-score of 96.0%, and a false positive rate below 3%. The model is further validated for edge deployment with a compact footprint (less than 5 MB) and inference latency under 10 ms. In addition, robustness testing against adversarial perturbations highlights the system’s resilience to AI-enabled evasion attacks.

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this paper is to develop an adaptive output feedback quantized control scheme for strict-feedback nonlinear systems. Three technical challenges must be overcome in addressing this problem. First, it is necessary to compensate for the unknown parameter associated with sensor failures, but the existing compensating method is applicable only within the backstepping framework, which complicates the overall design process. Second, sensor failures lead to only corrupted output being available and prevent the observer and controller from utilizing the true system output. Third, the nature of input quantization renders the actual controller discontinuous, which unavoidably introduces an undesirable quantization error and thus poses a challenge in mitigating its effect. To circumvent these difficulties, this paper establishes a new compensation scheme and a transformation of the control signal to address the effects of sensor failures and input quantization. A concise dynamic gain approach is proposed to construct a novel adaptive observer by using only the corrupted output signal. It is shown that, with the derived output feedback quantized controller, all closed-loop signals are bounded and the tracking error converges to an adjustable region. Two simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Dexterous prosthetic control demands intent decoders that calibrate quickly and remain robust to arm-pose variation. We present a transfer-learning framework that advances the calibration-based family of algorithms via a dual-branch Transformer fusing surface electromyography (sEMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals. Training proceeds in three stages:(i) SourceNet learns pose-robust, subject-agnostic features from a multi-subject cohort; (ii) TargetNet adapts these features to a new user with only two repetitions per class; and (iii) PFCNet (Parallel Feature Concatenation) combines SourceNet and TargetNet embeddings for final classification. To our knowledge, prior calibration-based methods have focused predominantly on sEMG-only pipelines and do not explicitly optimize the models using additional sensing modalities during calibration; our modality-aware design addresses this gap. On a held-out subject (9 subjects; held-out subject evaluation; two-repetition calibration), the Transformer decoder achieves 99.35% accuracy, surpassing a strong CNN baseline while using approximately five times fewer learnable parameters. This supports embedded, real-time deployment. This model comprises 3.71M parameters (≈ 14.84 MB in 32-bit float; ≈ 3.71 MB when 8-bit quantized). Accordingly, its embedded inference footprint and latency are small: we expect single-digit to low double-digit millisecond inference times depending on hardware (e.g., sub-10 ms with 8-bit quantization on an NPU, or tens of ms on a CPU-only platform), making the system compatible with real-time prosthetic control. Ablations confirm that (a) sEMG–IMU fusion is essential for accuracy under pose changes and (b) minimal, two-repetition calibration suffices for reliable personalization. To enable reproducibility, we release a systematically curated dataset of nine subjects with synchronized sEMG and IMU recordings. Collectively, the proposed framework delivers a more accurate, parameter-efficient, and rapidly calibratable solution for prosthetic hand control, extending the calibration-based algorithm family with a principled, multimodal optimization strategy."

Interline PFCs have been gaining attention for the last decade due to their easy structure and no need for an external power supply. This paper discusses various interline PFC topologies along with their advantages and disadvantages. The existing topologies are compared with respect to several aspects. These aspects include, for instance, modularity, the number of capacitors, the control range of the PFC, the shape of voltage waveforms inserted by the PFC on the lines, number of devices, the directionality of the current, simplicity of the topology, total power semiconductor rating and losses, and protection of the topologies for external faults. It is concluded that the topology of a PFC for a particular application can be chosen depending on the main goal since the topologies come with their advantages and disadvantages when classified based on various aspects."

    "abstract": "The cross-scene classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces challenges posed by different sensors and various land cover categories, and methods based on the cross-domain Few-shot Learning (FSL) framework are commonly used to address the challenge. However, current few-shot learning (FSL) methods struggle with the issue of intra-domain inductive bias, where models tend to learn simplistic and potentially erroneous correlations within samples (classes with similar backgrounds are always confused due to simple correlations with the background), leading to poor generalization ability to target domains. Furthermore, most approaches employ a patch-wise representation learning mechanism, which provides the model with all information within a sample, but inherently limits its representation capacity when dealing with the limited prior information in FSL tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Block-wise Contrastive Few-shot Learning (BCFSL) framework. First, a multi-view cross-domain mixing strategy enhances spatial diversity and constructs harder samples to mitigate inductive bias. Second, a novel block-wise representation mechanism performs fine-grained feature extraction from local regions, improving generalization. Finally, a multi-view spectral reconstruction module preserves essential high-dimensional spectral information during training and assists the block-wise representation in fully leveraging prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HSI datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "When free electrons travel photonic crystals (PCs), multiple transition radiations occur, yielding highly directional resonance radiation if the emitted electromagnetic (EM) waves are coherent. In this work, we have investigated the resonance transition radiation regulated by the moiré lattices, which can offer greater flexibility in manipulating EM waves compared to conventional PCs, facilitating more intricate free-electron radiation phenomena. In particular, an exponential scattering matrix cascading approach is proposed, which can significantly decrease the necessary cascading steps, signifying a substantial reduction in computational resources. The angular energy density distribution is obtained and the velocity forbidden zone is observed. The radiation modes are categorized into s- and p-polarized types, determined by the inherent dispersion relation and iso-frequency contours. It is also found that the lattice band gap leads to a significant suppression of the radiation. Our work could provide a foundation for exploring the promising wave behavior within the moiré lattices."

    "abstract": "Correlation clustering (CC) offers an effective approach to analyze scalar field ensembles by detecting correlated regions and consistent structures, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns. However, existing CC methods are computationally expensive, making them impractical for both interactive analysis and large-scale scalar fields. We introduce the Local-to-Global Correlation Clustering (LoGCC) framework, which accelerates pivot-based CC by leveraging the spatial structure of scalar fields and the weak transitivity of correlation. LoGCC operates in two stages: a local step that uses the neighborhood graph of the scalar field's spatial domain to build highly correlated local clusters, and a global step that merges them into global clusters. We implement the LoGCC framework for two well-known pivot-based CC methods, Pivot and CN-Pivot, demonstrating its generality. Our evaluation using synthetic and real-world meteorological and medical image segmentation datasets shows that LoGCC achieves speedups-up to 15× for Pivot and 200× for CN-Pivot-and improved scalability to larger scalar fields, while maintaining cluster quality. These contributions broaden the applicability of correlation clustering in large-scale and interactive analysis settings."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the key factors predicting computational thinking (CT) attainment among Korean elementary- and middle-school students and to provide educational implications for promoting CT education. Using national-level digital literacy assessment data collected by the Korean government (14,468 elementary- and 16,622 middle-school students), we developed machine-learning-based predictive models and applied Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), an explainable AI (XAI) technique, to evaluate feature importance and interaction effects. The SHAP analysis revealed that information and communications technology (ICT) literacy levels, coding skills, and perceptions of the future occupational usefulness of digital devices were common positive predictors of CT attainment for both groups. For elementary students, Internet search proficiency and grade level exerted additional positive effects, whereas the time spent on digital devices for out-of-home learning purposes, leisure-centered use, and high autonomy negatively affected CT attainment. Among middle-school students, the ability to create presentation materials emerged as a key positive factor, whereas the effects of grade level and information-search ability were relatively limited. SHAP dependence analysis demonstrated that combinations of ICT literacy levels, grades, coding skills, and perceptions of occupational usefulness consistently enhanced CT attainment, whereas the combination of high digital autonomy with occupational usefulness perceptions hindered CT attainment. These findings highlight the need to systematically strengthen ICT and coding education, establish stage-specific strategies, and provide guidance for goal-oriented and structured digital use. Ultimately, this study contributes to academic significance by applying XAI methods to national-level CT data, enabling interpretable analysis of feature importance and interaction effects, and uncovering complex relationships among variables that traditional statistical approaches could not fully reveal."

    "abstract": "Multi-signatures have recently garnered considerable attention, particularly within the domain of smart contracts in blockchain ecosystems, as they enhance account security and mitigate single points of failure by requiring the approval of multiple key holders for transaction execution. However, most existing multi-signature schemes heavily rely on traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which requires a trusted authority and conflicts with the decentralized nature of blockchain technology. Certificateless multi-signature (CLMS) schemes, which eliminate the requirement for a trusted authority, represent promising solutions to address this issue. Nevertheless, existing CLMS schemes encounter challenges that limit their suitability for smart contract applications, including high communication overhead, expensive verification costs, and “loose\" security reductions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel two-round certificateless multi-signature schemes. These schemes not only support key aggregation but also optimize the signing process with two-round communication, maintaining fixed computational overhead during verification. Furthermore, the security proofs for the proposed schemes are independent of the Forking lemma, resulting in tighter security reductions and strengthened security assurance. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly reduce both communication and computational overhead compared to existing CLMS schemes, making them more efficient and practical for blockchain-based smart contract applications."

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of confidential computing, security-sensitive applications are often deployed in confidential virtual machines (CVMs), which reduce reliance on third-party cloud providers. However, privilege attacks originating from the OS remain a significant threat in these environments. Existing finer-grained isolation schemes, such as SHELTER (USENIX SEC’23), provide process-level protection but are still vulnerable to intra-process attacks and potential collusion between the OS and intra-process adversaries. Many current intra-process isolation techniques continue to depend on the OS to manage and enforce isolation domains, leading to a large Trusted Computing Base (TCB). This gap highlights the need for more granular, less trust-dependent confidential computing solutions. In this paper, we present CCAegis, a system that extends the Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) to enforce intra-process isolation of sensitive data and operations, safeguarding them from both intra-process adversaries and the OS. We employ static analysis to track the flow of sensitive data and identify functions that handle such data. Permission-switching instructions are inserted at the function call and return points, adjusting permissions via the Granule Protection Table (GPT) to ensure that only designated functions can access the isolated data. Notably, CCAegis places trust solely in the Secure Monitor, which configures the GPTs and manages domain switching, thereby minimizing the TCB. We implemented CCAegis on both an official emulator and a real development board to assess its performance. Our experimental results show that CCAegis effectively isolates sensitive data and operations, with performance overheads ranging from 1.01× to 1.43× compared to the original version across real-world cryptographic workloads."

    "abstract": "With the continuous expansion of photovoltaic (PV) systems, accurate and efficient fault detection has become increasingly vital to ensure operational stability and safety. Federated learning (FL) offers an effective solution for distributed model training in PV applications while preserving data privacy. However, conventional FL methods face significant challenges in the presence of data heterogeneity, class imbalance, and inconsistent model convergence. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel aggregation approach, termed Class-Aware Federated Proximal Aggregation (CAFPA), which integrates the local regularization mechanism of FedProx and the label-aware aggregation strategy of FedLA, and incorporates the YOLOv8 object detection model for PV cell fault identification. Moreover, CAFPA introduces an adaptive learning rate strategy, combining accuracy plateau detection and cosine annealing, to further enhance convergence speed and stability of the global model. Experiments conducted on multiple non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) clients demonstrate that CAFPA outperforms mainstream methods such as FedAvg, FedProx, and FedLA in terms of mAP50, accuracy, and convergence speed, highlighting its strong potential for deployment in edge computing scenarios."

    "abstract": "Subjective measurement remains one of the most widely used approaches for evaluating quality of experience (QoE) in tactile virtual environments. However, its reliability is often compromised by factors such as conscious bias, variations in user expressiveness, and contextual influences, which may distort the accuracy of evaluation outcomes. In light of the fact that electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct window into neurophysiological correlates of emotion and cognitive states, this paper proposes an objective QoE evaluation method for virtual reality (VR) with vibrotactile feedback based on inter-user brain spatial information (IBSI). The proposed IBSI feature extraction method enhances the conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm through the introduction of a regularization constraint term designed to mitigate overfitting. Moreover, the covariance matrix of each non-target user is weighted according to its Kullback–Leibler divergence from the target user, enhancing cross-user alignment and supporting effective transfer of neural information. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we design a VR shooting interaction experiment involving 64 participants. The study comprises three main phases: preparation, interaction, and subjective feedback. During the preparation phase, participants receive task explanations and familiarize themselves with the VR environment. In the interaction phase, participants complete a standardized shooting task while EEG data are recorded synchronously. Finally, subjective feedback is collected through questionnaires. QoE assessment is accomplished by classifying IBSI features using classical classifiers, with subjective QoE ratings serving as ground truth. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in classification accuracy, and the dominant activation pattern in the alpha rhythm is consistent with neural mechanisms associated with motor perception. Meanwhile, the mutual interpretability between subjective and objective data characterizing QoE further validates the rationality of the experimental paradigm."

While advanced deep learning mechanisms have significantly improved detection performance, the role of bounding box orientation remains underexplored.

This study investigates whether OBB can enhance SOD. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of OBBs by comparing them with horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) within a YOLO-based detection framework. The target object is the tiny “NoteHead” from the DeepScoresV2 public dataset. Given DeepScoresV2's clean background, we further extend our evaluation to noisy images. Results show that OBBs consistently outperform HBBs across multiple experimental settings.

As a result of being dynamic and decentralized, VANETs are vulnerable to major cybersecurity concerns such Sybil attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and routing manipulation. In these cases, typical security processes usually stay the same. This paper looks at how to employ bio-inspired algorithms like Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Bee Algorithms to make VANET safer by using secure routing, intrusion detection, and anomaly monitoring. We also proposed a hybrid security system that combines blockchain-based decentralized trust management with swarm intelligence. Swarm algorithms enable you identify and update things in real time, while blockchain technology makes sure that trust and behavior data are always shared and can be checked across the network. The document talks about what has been written about the subject so far, points out issues with putting the ideas into practice, and underlines key gaps in the study. Our suggested plan is a solid and flexible technique to keep VANETs safe in big, high-mobility areas."

The conventional direct-to-Earth communication architecture relies on limited and oversubscribed deep space networks, which are further challenged by the radiative environment and insufficient visibility in certain areas of the cislunar domain. We address these issues by proposing a foundational move toward inter-domain space network cooperation by introducing architectures based on near space networks. They can directly service lunar surface users or, via cislunar relays, by forming a resilient and multi-layered communication backbone. First, we establish a unified link analysis framework incorporating frequently disregarded environmental factors, such as the Moon's variable illumination, to provide a high-fidelity performance evaluation. Second, we assess architectures' reliability based on the outage risk, essential for quantifying the operational robustness of communication links. Finally, to manage the inherent dynamism of architectures, we propose an inter-domain space digital twin: a dynamic decision-making engine that performs real-time analysis to autonomously select the best communication path, ensuring high and stable reliability while simultaneously optimizing power consumption. Overall, our paper provides a holistic architectural and conceptual management framework, emphasizing the necessity of lunar communications to support a permanent human and economic foothold on the Moon."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an automated method for extracting parasitic elements of SiC MOSFET double pulse test (DPT) circuits. The approach uses the open-source PYLTspice package to simulate the DPT under varying parasitic elements. A differential evolution (DE) optimizer adjusts these parasitic values so that the simulated switching energies ($E_{\\text {on }}$ and $E_{\\text {off }}$) match the device data sheet’s specified loss curves. The tuned model achieves up to a $92.7 \\%$ reduction in error between simulated and data sheet switching loss values, compared to the untuned baseline.This workflow avoids the need for commercial 3D field solvers (e.g., Ansys Q3D or Altium Designer) since the circuit layout is not available and relies entirely on free SPICE tools. The results emphasize that stray, connection, and component placement parasitic inductances have a non-negligible impact on switching performance. Even slight variations in these inductances can cause switching losses to deviate significantly from data sheet values. Incorporating these parasitic elements yields simulated waveforms that closely follow the data sheet curves especially for high current devices, highlighting the importance of modeling parasitic elements in switching device simulations. and in SPICE-based converter and inverter designs to ensure result accuracy."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem that the current Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction approaches of rolling bearing have a single feature extraction capability and cannot fully utilize the spatio-temporal information embedded in data, an innovative RUL prediction technique leveraging CEEMDAN combined with TCN-BiLSTM-Multi-head Self-attention is proposed. Simultaneous extraction of spatial features hidden in time-series data is achieved through a dual-network architecture consisting of a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. The degradation feature information is enhanced through multi-head self-attention weighting, followed by the RUL prediction of rolling bearing through fully connected layers. The designed model fully utilizes bearing characteristics extracted from both the frequency domain and 1D time series data. Combined with signal processing techniques, these features enable a multi-dimensional characterization of the degradation evolution in bearing. By employing the proposed methods, the RUL prediction intervals can be efficiently quantified without relying on physical or statistical prior information about the bearing system. A case study on rolling bearing is conducted to validate the advantages of the suggested approach. Experimental findings prove that the developed model improves prediction accuracy and tends to anticipate the RUL slightly in advance, which helps to carry out the predictive maintenance."

    "abstract": "Multiple input multiple output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) leverages the characteristic of multichannel spatial parallel sampling to achieve high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging. However, existing MIMO-SAR motion compensation methods ignore the differences in motion errors between channels and the range spatial variation of the phase errors of the scene, which degrades the Doppler ambiguity suppression performance and ultimately affects imaging results. In order to solve these two existing problems, this article proposes a joint parameter estimation and subspace segmentation inversion method for motion error compensation. The method Firstly establishes a geometric model of motion errors for MIMO-SAR. With this model, subspace segmentation estimation and parameter estimation are applied to invert the platform motion errors. Finally, the motion error is accomplished by using the motion parameters obtained from the inversion. The proposed method compensates for spatially variant motion errors in the range direction through segmentation processing and compensates for each channel motion errors before the Doppler ambiguity suppression, thereby improving imaging quality. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Fraud detection is a critical challenge for large economic entities, as the advancement of new technologies in commerce and online banking has increased the use of credit card payments, leading to a rise in fraudulent transactions. Researchers employ various methods to detect and analyze these fraudulent activities, which can cause significant damage to financial institutions and individuals. Current credit card fraud detection methods mostly rely on supervised approaches requiring labeled and balanced datasets. However, in practice, datasets are often highly imbalanced, with few labels or sometimes none at all, which suggests the need to use other techniques and approaches. In this paper, we present an approach that relies on unsupervised techniques by comparing several methods on a highly imbalanced dataset, including Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IF), One-Class SVM (OC-SVM), and Autoencoder (AE), along with two ensemble methods based on majority voting and score aggregation. After evaluating these methods using various metrics, we found that the Isolation Forest algorithm generally delivers the best performance compared to the other methods, including the proposed ensemble methods."

    "abstract": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has become a vital technique for ensuring the safe operation of critical engineering structures. Among various SHM approaches, guided wave–based damage detection has attracted widespread attention due to its ability to capture early structural anomalies over long distances by extracting signal-based features from wave propagation paths. However, existing methods often rely on single damage-sensitive features, which are susceptible to noise and insufficient for describing complex signal variations. Meanwhile, deep learning–based approaches,although effective in feature learning, typically require large labeled datasets and suffer from limited interpretability in practical engineering applications.To address these limitations, this study proposes a two-stage clustering-based unsupervised damage identification method using multiple physically interpretable features.Three types of damage-sensitive indicators are extracted from each guided wave propagation path: correlation coefficient, envelope energy ratio, and time of maximum difference. In the first stage, K-means clustering is employed on a path level to distinguish damaged from undamaged paths based on the correlation-energy feature space. In the second stage, a 36-dimensional time-of-flight vector is constructed using the identified damaged paths for each damage case. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is then applied to classify 28 damage cases into seven structural zones.The proposed method achieves an identification accuracy of 85.7%, demonstrating strong performance in both localization and interpretability. Compared to traditional single-feature-based or deep learning approaches, the proposed technique offers advantages in requiring no labeled data, being computationally efficient, and providing robust physical interpretability, thus showing great potential for real-world SHM scenarios with limited data and high reliability requirements."

Within the physical layer, a bearing test bench equipped with sensors facilitates data acquisition, with data fusion achieved through transformation and encapsulation processes. The data layer utilizes the OPC UA communication protocol to enable data interaction and synchronous mapping, thereby generating twin data. In the virtual layer, 3D modeling and rendering are performed, followed by model integration into Unity 3D to realize the virtual mapping of the physical entity. Building upon this foundation, the fault diagnosis module employs order analysis and result encoding to derive image data, which is subsequently processed by a deep learning model for fault diagnosis. This architecture achieves synergistic coordination among the physical, data, and virtual layers. It is anticipated to enhance the accuracy and real-time performance of bearing fault diagnosis and provide effective support for the predictive maintenance of industrial equipment."

    "abstract": "Digital transformation and the rise of electronic payments in the post-COVID19 period require more accurate methods of biometric authentication. Standard biometric authentication methods show limitations when users wear masks and gloves. In this paper, the method of biometric authentication AC-CNN (Adaptive Clustered Convolutional Neural Network) is proposed. AC-CNN is based on the classification of facial images into clusters and their vectorization using previously trained CNN facial recognition models (e.g.VGGFace, ArcFace, DeepFace). After classification, the facial image is vectorized by the CNN algorithm, which shows the best facial recognition accuracy for facial images from that cluster. The registration and verification processes use different types of CNN algorithms. In the process of user identification, after successful user identification, the type of CNN algorithm that was used for that user in the registration process is loaded from the database and the same CNN algorithm will be used in the verification process. In the verification process, the biometric template of the identified user is compared with the reference biometric template contained in the database and based on their Euclidean distance, a verification decision is calculated. Since the biometric templates of the users in the database are divided into clusters, an allowable decision threshold is calculated separately for each cluster. The results of experimental research show that the presented method allows for increased verification accuracy even in conditions where the face is masked and when only partial biometric data is available."

Nonetheless, generating a comprehensive circuit diagram during the early stages of architectural design is a significant challenge for designers. At present, there are no established computer-aided design tools capable of automatically generating MPU circuit diagrams during the early stages of design. This research addresses this gap by enabling the automatic generation of MPU circuit diagrams at the architecture design level. Our MPU architecture design toolset, MEIMAT, has been enhanced to visualize the MPU circuit diagram required to execute a given assembly program. We present a novel method for generating the MPU circuit diagram by synthesizing instruction circuit diagrams derived from assembly programs written with MEIMAT's metainstructions. The MPU circuit diagram is visualized based on a corresponding MPU functional expression, which is synthesized from the functional expressions of the meta-instructions within the assembly program. Since the meta-instructions are capable of representing any instruction set, MEIMAT can generate MPU circuit diagrams for arbitrary assembly programs. This innovative toolset empowers MPU designers to achieve a comprehensive and precise understanding of architectural configurations during development."

Consequently, it becomes imperative to proactively assess the system strength margin (SSM) of the system to implement timely measures for ensuring secure and stable grid operation. To this end, this paper proposes a federated learning-based SSM prediction method for multi-infeed systems. Firstly, based on the generalized short-circuit ratio (gSCR) theory, the quantification of the SSM under non-rated condition in multi-infeed systems is established. Subsequently, a SSM prediction architecture is constructed via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, leveraging their proven efficacy in capturing nonlinear time-series dependencies. Furthermore, on the premise of data privacy, the collaborative training of the SSM prediction model for multiple wind farms has been achieved based on federated learning. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed SSM prediction model are verified by some simulations in a multi-infeed system with 9 wind farms."

    "abstract": "Replication nodes can compromise a network by not only stealing confidential data but also by selectively forwarding packets and injecting false data to the base station. This undermines the base station’s decision-making, ultimately allowing attackers to control the network. Scholars have proposed various solutions to deal with this attack. However, network performance is still susceptible to its impact because of their inherent limitations. In this paper, we introduce a novel authentication scheme. In this scheme, the network contains high-energy nodes, mobile sensor nodes (MSNs), and a base station. High energy nodes act as cluster heads. MSNs must be authenticated by a cluster head before they can obtain or provide data to the cluster head. Authentication between intra-cluster nodes relies on key information pre-distributed by the cluster head, leveraging a Bloom filter for efficient verification. Within a cluster, node a will only forward node b’s data after node b is authenticated by node a. The analysis and simulation validate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the network’s resilience against replication attacks. The communication probability between high-energy nodes is about 90%, and the probability that high-energy nodes can complete MSNs authentication within 1 hop is about 1; after introducing the bloom filter scheme within the cluster, the storage overhead of MSNs can be reduced by 90%, and the impact on the transmission of information from MSNs within the cluster to the cluster head can be ignored."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, traffic signal management has been largely tactical and operated from the “bottom-up,” focusing on individual intersection performances influenced by public suggestions, field observation, and in some cases high-resolution controller data. Connected vehicle trajectory data now enables a scalable, complementary “top-down” approach for system-wide performance analysis, even for locations with no detection or communication. This paper proposes a data architecture for derived performance measures that can be used for both strategic (top-down) and tactical (bottom-up) management of traffic signals. To leverage a “top-down” approach, large amounts of data must be processed into smaller datasets. For efficiency and interoperability between performance measures and the tools used to derive the same, a scalable data management architecture is essential. This paper discusses and demonstrates a framework developed for the Indiana Department of Transportation, which contains the derived information from over 177 billion records per year for the state, covering more than 2,500 signalized intersections in just 80,000 or so rows of derived performance measures. This framework collects data using a combination of a fixed time period, date, movement, approach, and intersection identifier. The structured model of derived performance measures supports both tactical applications, such as green-time allocation, and top-down, strategic management applications such as identifying capacity-constrained signals that are candidates for capital improvements. This framework is applicable to other tools used to derive performance measures, such as high-resolution or LiDAR datasets."

The effective operation of RIS relies on accurate channel state information (CSI) obtained from channel estimation. However, accurate channel estimation is challenging due to the passive nature and the presence of high pilot overhead. Recently, deep learning (DL) based channel estimation methods have shown potential. However, high model complexity and low estimation accuracy are still key issues. This paper proposes a user partitioning channel estimation method based on reparameterization and coordinate attention network (RCANet). The proposed method uses user partitioning to achieve angle segmentation for accurate estimation and obtains the estimated channel by the trained RCANet. Initially, partial CSI is obtained by RIS elements grouping and least square (LS) algorithms. Subsequently, the data of users in the partition is utilized to train RCANet in the offline training part. Finally, using well-trained network allows estimating the channel with low complexity in the online test part. Our comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method has lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) as well as lower complexity compared to other channel estimation algorithms."

First, we conduct multi-scale decomposition of the EES sequence using the improved CEEMDAN algorithm with dynamic noise injection and energy entropy control to suppress modal aliasing and extract high/low-frequency components and residual terms. Second, we construct a frequency-segmented prediction architecture: The architecture adopts the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to adaptively adjust long short-term memory (LSTM) hyperparameters for capturing short-term fluctuations in high-frequency components, while employing the grey model (GM) to predict long-term trends in low-frequency components. Finally, we introduce an attention mechanism to dynamically fuse multi-band prediction results. An empirical study taking a certain province in southern China as an example shows that the model performs well in indicators such as root mean square error (RMSE=0.85) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE=3.5%), and the mutation detection rate (STR=11.8%) indicates its sensitive capture ability for unexpected events such as policy adjustments.

While early digital device usage among children is often met with concern, especially regarding its potential impact on learning, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of its academic implications. Leveraging data from 156,277 15-year-old students across 18 OECD countries collected through the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), we used a pooled variance analysis to examine how early digital exposure can influence learning outcomes. Contrary to common concerns, early digital exposure does not hinder academic performance and is often associated with comparable or even superior outcomes. These outcomes, however, depend significantly on environmental factors. Countries with strong educational systems and effective digital integration such as Finland tend to gain more from early exposure. In contrast, nations facing socioeconomic crises, like the Dominican Republic, often show uneven ICT development. The study highlights the importance of educational equity, infrastructure investment, and policy design in shaping the effects of initial digital access, underlining the need for data driven, context sensitive strategies to support technology enhanced learning."

Using the theory of diffraction, we deduce the mapping between the locations of point-sources in the free-space and the pseudorandom pattern obtained from SRPE systems, obtain an initial maximum-likelihood estimate of the point-source locations, use a Markovian motion prior to predict the locations at subsequent time-instants and, use captured video frames to refine the predicted location estimates. Our results show that lensless SRPE systems, coupled with PHD filtering algorithm, can estimate lateral motion of point-sources accurately and in a computationally efficient manner. Moreover, lateral motion tracking with SRPE is robust to motion-blur and increase in image-sensor pixel size. Tracking with lensless SRPE systems also show robustness to dimensionality reduction of the captured pseudorandom patterns which have computational benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate lensless SRPE systems as an object tracking modality."

    "abstract": "Although multi-tier vehicular Metaverse promises to transform vehicles into essential nodes – within an interconnected digital ecosystem – using efficient resource allocation and seamless vehicular twin (VT) migration, this can hardly be achieved by the existing techniques operating in a highly dynamic vehicular environment, since they can hardly balance multi-objective optimization problems such as latency reduction, resource utilization, and user experience (UX). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-tier resource allocation and VT migration framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), a hierarchical Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism, and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). The GCN-based model captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within the vehicular network; the Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism fosters cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure; and the MADRL algorithm jointly optimizes resource allocation and VT migration in real time. By modeling this dynamic and multi-tier vehicular Metaverse as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop a MADRL-based algorithm dubbed the Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MO-MADDPG), which can effectively balances the various conflicting objectives. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of this algorithm that is demonstrated to enhance scalability, reliability, and efficiency while considerably improving latency, resource utilization, migration cost, and overall UX by 12.8%, 9.7%, 14.2%, and 16.1%, respectively."

As a core subsystem in electric aircraft, electric propulsion systems require comprehensive evaluation of their technological progress, ongoing challenges, and future opportunities to support the development of low-altitude aviation. Unlike land vehicle applications, aircraft propulsion systems demand safety-critical designs governed by stringent operational constraints. This review identifies three critical metrics for such systems: power density, operational reliability and fault tolerance, and thermal management efficiency. While existing studies often address these metrics individually, their interdependencies are not well explored. To bridge this gap, this review systematically investigates state-of-the-art solutions, benchmarks their limitations under flight-critical conditions, and establishes correlations between technological advancements and operational requirements. Furthermore, it highlights future research directions by identifying emerging methodologies. As low-altitude aviation approaches scalable deployment, this paper aims to serve as a technical reference to support the safe and effective development of aerial propulsion technologies."

Existing solutions predominantly rely on rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches, the SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling-based deployment method, eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance. The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional robotic dressing assistance."

    "abstract": "This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and sensing systems and their scaling behavior as a function of the antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard array geometries to ease the design of the large antenna arrays under given system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Moreover, when considering a region where the beamfocusing resolution does not exceed a specified threshold, the extent of the region is also shown to scale linearly with the array size. Finally, the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array’s broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications."

The goal is to maximize the minimum beampattern gain under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users. The optimization jointly controls transmit beamforming, RIS phase shift, DL power allocation, and UL transmit power. A centralized training with decentralized execution approach is adopted, where two agents are defined: a DL agent responsible for DL beamforming, RIS configuration, and power allocation, and a UL agent responsible for uplink power control. Each agent interacts with the shared environment, which comprises the base station (BS), RIS, and users, and learns its optimal policy under time-varying channels and mutual interference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent PPO (MA-PPO) significantly outperforms baseline methods, including single-agent PPO and heuristic schemes, in terms of convergence speed, sum-rate, and beampattern gain. Moreover, the MA-PPO method exhibits superior scalability and performance in FD mode over half-duplex (HD) counterparts under various user densities and RIS configurations, showcasing its effectiveness for real-time joint communication and sensing in next-generation wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Many different models of the physical world exhibit chaotic dynamics, from fluid flows and chemical reactions to celestial mechanics. The study of the three-body problem (3BP) and its many different families of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) has provided fundamental insight into chaotic dynamics as far back as the 19th century. The 3BP, a conservative system, is inherently challenging to sample due to its volume-preservation property. In this paper we present an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control of UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and the local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising prior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables sample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincaré map in as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincaré map is best discovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e. the local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the UPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving a convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We constrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system, resulting in locally-optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable manifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across several orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from robotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for computational power in cloud computing has made Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) essential for providing substantial computational capacity. Efficiently allocating GPU resources is crucial due to their high cost. Additionally, it’s necessary to considercloud environment characteristics, such as dynamic workloads, multi-tenancy, and requirements like isolation. One key challenge is efficiently allocating GPU resources while maintaining isolation and adapting to dynamic workload fluctuations. Another challenge is ensuring scheduling maintains fairness between tenants while meeting task requirements (e.g., completion deadlines). While existing approaches have addressed each challenge individually, none have tackled both challenges simultaneously. This is especially important in dynamic environments where applications continuously request and release GPU resources. This paper introduces a new dynamic GPU resource allocation method, incorporating fair and requirement-aware task scheduling. We present a novel algorithm that leverages the multitasking capabilities of GPUs supported by both hardware and software. The algorithm schedules tasks and continuously reassesses resource allocation as new tasks arrive to ensure fairness. Simultaneously, it adjusts allocations to maintain isolation and satisfy task requirements. Experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm offers several advantages over existing state-of-the-art solutions. It reduces GPU resource usage by 88% and significantly decreases task completion times."

    "abstract": "Estimating the travel time of ultrasound in an inhomogeneous medium is crucial for high-quality imaging, as with an accurate estimate of the distribution of speed of sound, phase aberration, which is normally viewed as one of the main reasons for image degradation, can be corrected by multiple methods. To estimate the ultrasound travel time, the approach using solutions to the eikonal equation is attractive, since it can be easily integrated into a conventional delay-and-sum beamformer. In our manuscript, we first propose employing the finite element method to solve the eikonal equation in ultrasound imaging, which is easy to extend to a high-order numerical scheme and potentially runs faster on GPU. We prove that the experimental order of convergence of our proposed method is approximately 2, which is advanced than fast marching methods with order of convergence around 1. The mean relative error of our results is less than $4 \\%$ in the imaging plane, compared to the results acquired with the fast marching method with one public dataset. These results preliminarily demonstrate the potential of applying finite element method as an alternative approach in calculating the travel time of ultrasound within inhomogeneous medium."

Operating within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), AVs continuously exchange sensitive data with other vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud services. These vehicles come packed with advanced IoT technologies that enable them to sense their surroundings, interact with their environment, and even operate autonomously. This high level of autonomy and connectivity offers significant benefits like safer roads and more efficient traffic, nevertheless it also creates new opportunities for cyberattacks. As the technology improves, so do the tactics used by attackers, who are constantly developing smarter ways to exploit vulnerabilities in connected systems or execute harmful actions that may compromise safety and public trust. Centralized security solutions, which are becoming outdated, are insufficient specially in a dynamic and distributed environment particularly in terms of security and system performance. This survey paper proposes a multi-layered security architecture for blockchain-enabled AV networks, built upon Hyperledger Fabric.

    "abstract": "In airport operations, the common experience-based flight scheduling often leads to low runway utilization and air traffic congestion. Accurate flight flow prediction has become critically important to support informed and efficient scheduling decisions. To address this issue, this paper proposes an air traffic flow prediction method based on EMD-BiLSTM (Empirical Mode Decomposition-bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network) hybrid model and a dynamic margin driving strategy. Firstly, the EMD is used to adaptively decompose the non-stationary traffic data into multi-scale intrinsic mode functions to eliminate noise interference. By further capturing the bidirectional dependence of time series using BiLSTM, the fusion prediction model is constructed. Then, the throughput margin equation is defined based on the prediction results and the maximum runway capacity. A three-level response mechanism is also established to quantitatively support the flight scheduling strategy. Finally, the proposed methods are implemented to the Hangzhou Xiaoshan Airport. According to the historical departure flow data, the mean absolute percentage error of prediction is reduced to 7.18% compared with other models. Combined with the margin strategy, the runway overload risk probability in peak hours is also effectively reduced. The simultaneous construction of GIS airspace simulation and decision platform realizes the visualization of flow and strategy, improving the efficiency of airport operation and resource utilization."

    "abstract": "During lightning events and rainfall, transmission lines frequently experience tripping incidents due to breakdown discharges across insulator strings and air gaps, which significantly threaten the reliable operation of power systems. To investigate the mechanism by which direct lightning strikes on lightning protection lines lead to insulator flashover, this paper proposes a line insulation failure theory, based on the high-frequency electromagnetic pulse coupling principle and the characteristic behavior of lightning currents. The study examines the probability of insulator flashover induced by lightning strikes on lightning protection lines. The results indicate that lightning surges can be regarded as high-frequency electromagnetic pulses. When a lightning strike hits a lightning protection line, the capacitance between the ground wire and the phase wire induces a high-frequency coupling effect, accumulating high-frequency components of lightning voltage on the phase wire. This voltage is then transferred via the equivalent capacitance of insulator strings toward ground. Theoretical calculations show that the high-frequency components of lightning surges can penetrate the capacitive distance (approximately 10 to 15 meters) formed between the ground wire and the phase wire. This implies that when the high-frequency component of the lightning current reaches a certain threshold, it can pass through the equivalent phase-to-ground capacitance, and if the high-frequency current exceeds 2 to 5 A, a high-frequency flashover of the insulator is likely to occur. In addition to established mechanisms such as back flashover and shielding failures, the research identifies a previously underexplored phenomenon: high-frequency electromagnetic pulse coupling that induces small-current flashover. This phenomenon is substantiated by experimental evidence. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive theoretical framework for lightning-induced tripping and pro-vide a theoretical basis for designing and selecting external insulation for transmission lines."

Accurate identification of defect types responsible for partial discharge phenomena is therefore critical. Existing research on direct current ultra-high frequency signals primarily remains confined to single-characterization domains, with limited studies addressing the extraction of time-frequency domain features from direct current partial discharge signals. To address this gap, this paper investigates four typical defect models—protrusions, metal particles, air gaps, and insulator surface fouling—in direct current gas insulated switchgear. Time-domain and frequency-domain features are extracted, and time-frequency domain features are additionally derived using empirical wavelet transform and multiscale permutation entropy. A comparative analysis evaluates the characterization capabilities of three single domains for partial discharge signals. Finally, a three-branch convolutional neural network is developed to integrate features from all three domains, enabling joint detection and accurate classification of the four defect types."

The dataset was split into training and testing cohorts in a $70: 30$ ratio. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, confusion matrix metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), and decision curve analysis (DCA). An online prediction tool was also developed to facilitate clinical application. Results: A total of $\\mathbf{2, 1 8 5}$ patient records were evaluated, with 1,088 (49.79%) exhibiting COPD with comorbid hypertension. The implementation of the FASF framework significantly enhanced the predictive performance of the SuperLearner model, achieving an AUC of 0.91, an accuracy of 0.85, and precision, recall, and F1-scores of $\\mathbf{0. 8 3}$. All performance metrics were notably improved compared to the baseline model without FASF, and DCA confirmed the model’s high clinical utility. Conclusion: The SuperLearner-based prediction model employing the FASF framework demonstrates excellent discriminative capability and clinical decision-making benefit in assessing hypertension risk among COPD patients. By integrating a two-stage feature selection process with an adaptive weighting strategy, the model significantly enhances prediction accuracy, providing a robust tool for early identification of high-risk patients, personalized intervention planning, and the advancement of precision medicine."

    "abstract": "Voltage source converter valves are subjected to multiple internal and external stresses under long-term complex operating environments. There is a hidden danger of partial discharge caused by reduced insulation performance. Currently, there is a lack of effective means of discharge monitoring inside the converter valve hall. Usually, the occurrence of local discharge can only be investigated after the fault causes the converter valve to stop. Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the online monitoring technology to realize the active diagnosis of discharge faults. In this paper, a set of discharge fault identification methods based on key time-frequency feature extraction of mixed voiceprint signals is proposed. Firstly, the discharge signal is extracted from the mixed voiceprint pattern based on the fast independent component analysis method. Then the time-frequency spectral feature extraction is realized using Mel spectral analysis. Finally, a deep convolutional neural network is constructed to recognize the discharge fault type. In this paper, a voltage source converter valve discharge simulation test platform is built. The test results show that, compared with other algorithms, the method in this paper has superior accuracy while the computational speed is fast."

The research focuses on the automatic identification of four subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources, including morphologic images of peripheral blood smears and bone marrow smears, time series data of continuously monitored blood parameters, and flow cytometry data, a diagnostic framework integrating convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short term memory networks (LSTM) was constructed. The model uses CNN to extract image spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal dynamics, and achieves end-to-end classification through deep fusion of multi-dimensional information via a crossmodal attention mechanism. Empirical analysis shows that the model is significantly better than the mainstream multimodal algorithm in the diagnosis of four types of leukemia. The key advantage lies in strengthening the weight allocation of key biomarkers, improving the recall rate and AUC value, providing efficient and objective auxiliary diagnostic tools for clinical practice and promoting the development of accurate hematology."

    "abstract": "Modern industrial robotic systems often operate under dynamic working conditions, which can cause faults of motors in robotic arms and further lead to system reliability. However, existing fault diagnosis approaches typically rely on static signal features in combination with fixed thresholds, which limits their ability to capture temporal dynamics and structural dependencies. These methods treat sensor channels independently and lack mechanisms to model the spatiotemporal correlations within sensorial time series, which are critical for detecting subtle and localized fault patterns. To address these challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes a Spectral-and-GraphSAGE Enhanced Convolutional Network (SAGECN). This paper introduces a hybrid graph neural architecture that embeds GraphSAGE-based neighborhood aggregation into a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) backbone, enabling joint modeling of global topological structures and localized temporal perturbations. Sensor time-series data are first transformed into structured path graphs using a sliding window mechanism, preserving temporal continuity and directional progression. Then, a multi-stage Graph Neural Network encoder is constructed by stacking GCN and Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE) layers, enabling the extraction of both global and local structural features. Finally, top-k pooling is applied for hierarchical node selection and graph-level representation learning. Experimental results on a public dataset from fault-injected motors in robotic arms demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in fault detection accuracy and generalization compared with existing graph-based models."

Considering the characteristics of the self-excited asymmetric half-bridge power converter in switched reluctance generator (SRG), an adaptive parameter adjustment function is designed to overcome the lag and jitter issues of fixed-parameter TD under variable-speed operating conditions. Simulation results show that the collaboratively optimized TD controller achieves smoother chopper current transitions during wind speed fluctuations and effectively reduces DC bus voltage ripple compared to conventional TDs, demonstrating advantages in enhancing the dynamic performance and anti-interference capability of SRG."

    "abstract": "Bearing fault diagnosis is crucial for ensuring the operational reliability and safety of rotating machinery. However, traditional diagnostic methods face significant challenges: strong background noise often obscures weak fault signals, and reliance on single-sensor information provides an incomplete picture of complex fault states. These limitations can lead to decreased diagnostic accuracy and reliability. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel convolutional sparse bearing fault pattern recognition method based on multi-source heterogeneous information from vibration and sound signals. Firstly, embedding a convolutional sparse representation layer within the deep learning framework, which adaptively extracts key quasi-periodic fault impulses from raw multi-source signals and suppresses noise and irrelevant background features through an end-to-end learned convolutional dictionary and sparse constraints; secondly, designing a novel fusion convolutional layer that integrates standard convolution and dilated convolution to capture local fine structures and broader contextual and multi-scale information in parallel, thereby achieving deep and effective fusion of purified feature streams from different sensors. Finally, a classification stage utilizes these comprehensively fused features to perform the bearing fault diagnosis. Experimental results on multi-source heterogeneous datasets from two bearings types demonstrate that the proposed Multi-source Deep Sparse Representation Network(M-DSRN) method achieves outstanding fault recognition performance, compared with traditional rivals including deep neural networks and Sparse Representation Classification. This fully validates its effectiveness and advancement in achieving high-precision fault diagnosis under conditions involving strong background noise and multiple fault types through enhanced feature extraction and multi-source information fusion."

Specifically, we implement this framework using a Nouveau VAE (NVAE), which offers a hierarchical latent structure well-suited for complex time-series data. Latent vectors are sampled from a Gaussian distribution formed from the learned latent statistics and decoded into synthetic I/Q signals. This method allows lightweight and controlled signal generation without retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated signals exhibit realistic time-domain and spectral properties and achieve high classification accuracy when evaluated using a CNN-based UAV signal classifier. This confirms the utility of VAE-based generation for data augmentation in signal classification scenarios."

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors offer a promising solution for real-time fire monitoring in inaccessible terrains.

This paper proposes a hybrid integration system for real-time UAV-based fire detection monitoring, addressing the crucial need for unified and comprehensive data. Our approach centralises onboard data fusion on a Raspberry Pi companion computer, where MAVLink telemetry is intelligently merged with environmental sensor data and fire detection results. This fused data is transmitted to a remote web server using a structured REST API with a timestamp-based JSON payload. The proposed system design enhances data completeness and cohesion, minimises latency, and improves real-time situational awareness by providing a unified data source for monitoring personnel. This integrated solution is expected to significantly improve the responsiveness and effectiveness of UAV-based fire detection systems, despite facing challenges related to onboard computational resources, network reliability, and security, which are addressed with specific mitigation strategies and outlined as directions for future work."

    "abstract": "Advanced cyberattack patterns threatening network assets employ various attack vectors, multi-stage attack processes, and diverse penetration strategies. Among these multi-stage attack patterns, many exhibit behaviors similar to normal activities on the network or patterns commonly observed across multiple attack patterns. This tendency of advanced attacks makes it difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) models to learn the data distribution, allowing intrusion detection systems (IDS) to be bypassed and complicating the construction of effective IDS training datasets. To address these issues, this paper proposes an IDS system that segments and identifies multi-stage attack patterns into detailed sub-patterns, enabling effective classification and detection of multi-stage attacks. The proposed approach consists of attack pattern segmentation using a clustering algorithm and a detection model utilizing a stacking ensemble. The attack pattern segmentation method uses the inter-class silhouette metric to segment network flows related to attacks and subdivide the attack patterns. Using a stacking ensemble, the detection technique determines the final attack pattern by leveraging machine learning models that ensure explainability using the segmented attack patterns. The proposed approach was validated by comparing the detection accuracy of multi-stage attack patterns against recent baselines using the public benchmark dataset CIC-IDS-2018. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach achieved an average F1 score of 0.9732 for multi-stage attack patterns, demonstrating higher performance than recent baseline methods and effectively detecting sophisticated multi-stage attacks."

    "abstract": "The development of robust artificial intelligence based models for medical applications necessitates extensive datasets from multiple institutions. However, privacy concerns often hinder data sharing across these institutions. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising paradigm, facilitating collaborative model training while safeguarding data privacy. Nevertheless, the efficacy of FL is constrained by two fundamental challenges: system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. To address these challenges, recent studies have incorporated regularization terms into the objective function, aiming to improve the stability of the method. While these approaches have shown promising results, our study reveals that the fixed and manual calculation of the regularization term constrains its effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce FedDPO, a heterogeneity-aware federated learning approach that employs a reinforcement learning-driven strategy to dynamically determine an adaptive regularization term for each client’s objective function. This regularization term is tailored to individual client states, including data distribution, system specifications, and performance feedback, enabling regularized local model updates that account for heterogeneity across the federated network. Additionally, FedDPO incorporates local batch normalization to mitigate the impact of heterogeneous data. Extensive experiments on two medical and one non-medical image classification tasks demonstrate FedDPO’s consistent superiority over several baselines across diverse heterogeneity settings. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis provides formal guarantees of FedDPO’s efficacy compared to manual and heuristic proximal term selection methods."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel orthogonal Doppler frequency modulation (ODFM) to meet the challenging requirements of high-mobility communications. Firstly, we revisit the basic concepts of multicarrier modulations (MCMs) and discuss the capability to explore both time and frequency diversity in doubly selective channels for the most popular MCMs. We then illustrate how ODFM maps information symbols into Doppler-frequency domain and converts them into time-delay domain for transmission, where we show ODFM has the potential to exploit both delay space (frequency) and Doppler space (time) diversity. Specifically, we propose two types of ODFM schemes using the conventional time-frequency domain orthogonal pulses (TFOP-ODFM) and the novel delay-Doppler domain orthogonal pulses (DDOP-ODFM). We give exact channel input-output relations (IORs) in the Doppler-frequency domain of these two ODFM schemes and show their properties in efficient channels, implementation complexity, and others. Subsequently, we simulate the performance of these ODFM schemes with other MCMs, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. In particular, we investigate the performance of the TFOP-ODFM in the physical downlink shared channel of the Five-Generation New Radio (5G NR) link, where TFOP-ODFM show better performance than OFDM and OTFS."

    "abstract": "Scene synthesis is crucial to computer graphics. However, the current interactive scene synthesis methods usually cost the user too much time and interactions to edit objects. This paper presents a new interactive scene synthesis method that alleviates the designer from interacting with the 3D scene and its objects. Designers only need to select an object group in an independent panel through coarse clustering and fine clustering. Then, the furniture objects will be automatically added to the scene. This paper proposes a two-level clustering that applies the Affinity Propagation Algorithm (APA) to groups of furniture objects such that the object groups can even be clustered without linear representations, latent encoding, etc. To fully apply the APA, we also propose quantitatively measuring how different the two layouts are, i.e., how quantitatively the arrangements of two object groups differ. Experiments first show that our method is more user-friendly and interactively efficient than other interactive synthesis methods. By comparing our method with recent automatic scene synthesis methods, we demonstrate that our methods still have competitive plausibility. We also verify that our method does not harm the diversity and generalization of 3D scenes."

Two types of first-order DBGs, Model-I and Model-II, are inscribed based on single-laser-pass waveguide (SLPWG) and double-laser-pass waveguides (DLPWG), respectively. In Model-I DBG, the effective light-guiding occurs in the shell region with a refractive index (RI) change of ∼2×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>, while the core region exhibits a smaller RI change less than 0.4×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>. The enhanced slow-light phenomena are achieved at a 5 μm offset, yielding a transmission dip of 6.7 dB, a slow-down factor (SDF) of 1.21, and a maximum group delay (GD) of 33 ps. In Model-II DBG, the two-pass inscription combined with center distance adjustment in DLPWG enhances the core RI change by a factor of 2 over SLPWG, with a value of 0.8×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>, while the shell RI change decreases to ∼1×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> due to the lower repetition rate. With offset optimization, the transmission dip in Model-II DBG nearly doubles, up to 12.5 dB at a 5 μm offset with a 5 μm center distance, leading to slow-light effect with an SDF of 1.45 and a maximum GD of 43 ps—representing an 87% improvement in transmission, and 20% and 30% improvements in SDF and GD, respectively, compared to Model-I DBG. In addition, a time delay of ∼7 ps is obtained by comparing the detected signal pulse at the Bragg wavelength of Model-II DBG with the signal pulses at wavelengths tuned near the reflection edges, which represents an overestimated value for the slow-light effect. These results demonstrate that the two DBG models hold significant potential for optical filtering in communication and sensing, as well as in optical networks for data traffic management and dynamic reconfiguration of optical channels."

    "abstract": "Underwater image enhancement (UIE) aims to mitigate wavelength-dependent absorption and multi-path scattering effects, enabling the recovery of natural colors and rich details. Despite notable progress, consistently achieving high-quality enhancement in both fidelity and perceptual clarity remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we propose the Laplacian domain Dual-Focus Enhancer (DFE), an innovative framework consisting of two stages: adaptive diffusion-accelerated low frequency enhancement (ADALE) and progressive uncertainty driven high-frequency enhancement (PUHE). Specifically, DFE applies a Laplacian transform to decouple the frequency-specific degradations in underwater images, supporting fidelity- and clarity-oriented enhancement along separate pathways. To facilitate high-fidelity restoration, ADALE incorporates an HSV guided optimization mechanism (HSV-OM) to establish a robust color and brightness calibration baseline for the low-frequency diffusion model, adaptively managing basic degradations with minimal sampling steps. Furthermore, to enhance contour and detail perception, PUHE models the uncertainty of reference textures and integrates it with feature modulation to progressively reconstruct multi-scale high-frequency structures. The multi reference underwater texture enhancement (MUTE) dataset fur ther improves image clarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DFE outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

    "abstract": "Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with nested multi-type tree (MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains by providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive partition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity substantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based algorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our previous work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the characteristics of VVC inter coding and improve the partition map by incorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural network that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition map. It consists of several special designs, including stacked top-down and bottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and partitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold decision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity reduction and rate-distortion performance loss. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time saving with a 2.12% Bjøntegaard-delta-bit-rate under the random access configuration.

To bridge this capability gap in robotics, a novel tactile-sensitive artificial skin is designed to significantly enhance robot-object interaction and environmental recognition. The artificial skin, fabricated from a 2-mm thick silicone elastomer membrane embedded with polymer optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor array, achieves large measurement range (detecting forces up to 10 N normal and ±4 N shear) and high sensitivity for multiaxial forces. The skin's performance was evaluated through tests involving normal force loading of up to 10 N and shear force loading around ±4 N using a three-axis translation gantry. Additionally, the study examines slip-induced vibrations on various textured surfaces. A multi-input multi-output convolutional neural network (MIMO-CNN) was developed to simultaneously estimate force and recognize textures based on multichannel FBG inputs. The MIMO-CNN achieved an R-squared value of 0.96 for force estimation and classification accuracy of 94% for texture recognition across 20 fabric samples. These findings highlight the potential of tactile-sensitive artificial skin to enhance robotic perception and manipulation, paving the way for more advanced humanoid robotic systems."

To further improve structural insight, cut downtime, and reduce human hazard exposure, airborne inspection offers a means to deploy established Non-Destructive Evaluation methods in physical surface contact. This may significantly benefit elevated pipework inspection, where aging-related degradation causes critical failures but asset scale and inaccessibility render frequent manual assessment cost-prohibitive. To this end, a novel multirotor-crawler hybrid vehicle is developed from rigid-body modeling, through an offline energy-optimization interaction control scheme, to an experimental prototype. In a unique fly-crawl-fly inspection mode, this platform may crawl around the full circumference of pipes and other cylindrical assets following initial flight access. A multidirectional array of reversible thrust, fixed-pitch, propellers yield generic surface adhesion without magnetism or specific grasping features. This stable, short-reach, interaction relaxes control requirements and aids re-positioning during target contact. Laboratory testing demonstrates mean absolute deviation below 1.03 mm during arbitrary circumferential position holding and successful scanning around the target at 0.075±0.011 m/s. Multiple landings show repeatable successful transitions from flight to interaction at a mean distance of 12.68 mm from a target point. Performance and operational confidence bounds are thereby quantified."

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC), integrated with directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain technology, has emerged as a promising paradigm for ensuring secure and efficient resource trading between IoT user equipment (UEs) and edge service providers (ESPs). However, due to the open and heterogeneous nature of MEC networks, ESPs are susceptible to malicious attacks, rendering resource trading information potentially unreliable. While DAG blockchains ensure the reliability of on-chain data, they fail to guarantee the trustworthiness of ESPs and cannot effectively incentivize their participation in resource trading and blockchain consensus. To address these challenges, we develop a trust-driven resource trading framework for DAG blockchain-aided MEC networks. In this framework, we first design an off-chain trust-driven resource pricing mechanism, in which the resource price set by each ESP is positively correlated with its trust value. In addition, we design an on-chain trust-driven consensus mechanism, wherein the on-chain security of transactions published by each ESP is positively associated with its trust level. To enable UEs to better evaluate the on-chain transaction security, we design a novel metric termed transaction security satisfaction and incorporate it into the utility function of UEs. Furthermore, we model the resource trading between UEs and ESPs as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, and verify the existence and uniqueness of its equilibrium. To maximize the utilities of both ESPs and UEs, we propose a backward induction-based iterative algorithm to jointly optimize resource pricing, resource demand, and offloading strategy. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, demonstrating its superior performance compared with baseline schemes."

The model integrates attentionenhanced convolutional layers and multi-head Transformer encoders to capture both spatial and sequential features from CSI. A variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to regularize the latent feature space, improving generalization to unseen environments. By leveraging few-shot learning, the model constructs class prototypes that represent beam directions, enabling rapid adaptation to new scenarios with minimal supervision.

By integrating temporal dynamic features and static clinical indicators, this model achieves intelligent and precise typing of GC. The study collected clinical data of GC patients from multiple centers, including laboratory temporal indicators (dynamic monitoring data such as WBC, CRP, and bilirubin) and static features (CT radiomics and clinical baseline data). The LSTM network was used to model temporal data to capture the evolution patterns of inflammatory indicators, while the XGBoost[] algorithm was employed to analyze static features and select key predictive factors. Finally, a joint model was constructed through a feature-level fusion strategy. The results showed that the LSTM-XGBoost model performed the best on the test set (accuracy of $90 \\%$, AUC $=0.96$), significantly outperforming traditional methods ($\\mathbf{P}\\lt 0.05$). Specific findings include: among temporal features, the 48-hour change rate of CRP has the highest contribution to predicting gangrene progression; among static features, the proportion of low enhancement areas in the gallbladder wall on CT is a core imaging biomarker for typing. The model can effectively identify high-risk subtypes (e.g., ischemic vs. infectious types).By integrating multimodal data, the LSTM-XGBoost integrated model successfully achieved dynamic risk stratification and precise typing of GC, providing a reliable intelligent decision-making tool for early clinical intervention."

In this study, a mechanical locking principle-based insulating sheath installation technology is proposed, which systematically solves the problems of precise positioning, fixation and safe operation in an electrified environment by establishing a three-dimensional mechanical transfer model. The system integrates the elastic pre-tensioned \"telescopic column + positioning hole\" locking mechanism, \"4 horizontal and 4 vertical\" orthogonal grid adaptive adjustment system and high-precision closed-loop control module to realize sub-millimeter positioning accuracy. Experimental results show that the system maintains 100% structural stability under 4N radial tension and 8N axial pressure, and the maximum deformation is 0.21mm; the process capability index of force control accuracy is Cp=1.59 (n=100, σ=0.17), which reaches the level of industrial-grade precise control. In the field verification of 19 substations, the technology reduced the single-phase insulation sheathing installation time from the traditional 306 minutes to 5.3±0.3 minutes, while eliminating the need for power outages, significantly improving the efficiency of grid operation and maintenance and system reliability."

However, the quality of multichannel SAR images will suffer from electromagnetic jamming in the electronic antagonism environment, resulting in the loss of scene information. In this paper, we present a novel interference suppression method rooted in correlation filtering. First, multi -channel data undergoes multi -beam formation, and then one of the beam echoes is used as the interference matching signal; the other beam echo is correlation filtered to obtain the suppressed beam echo. Finally, inverse processing is applied to the multi-beam data, yielding interference-suppressed multi -channel data. Simulation confirms that this method effectively mitigates interference and obtains the HRWS SAR images."

    "abstract": "The service state of axle-box bearings in rail vehicles directly affects the safety of train operation. Current fault diagnosis methods based on spectral coherence (SCoh) often ignore the key information in the discrete fault bands excited by bearing faults, which reduces the diagnostic performance for weak faults. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on multiband clustering weighted envelope spectrum (MCWES). First, the original SCoh is reconstructed, and the proposed autocorrelation cycle ratio (ACR) calibration algorithm is utilized to achieve automatic identification of potential fault frequencies within each spectral frequency slice (SFS). Subsequently, a weighting metric is constructed to evaluate the richness of fault information in each SFS to determine the initial central frequency band for the optimization process. Next, an equal-proportional extended optimization structure is designed to generate EPEOgram for detecting the optimal demodulation bands in each initial center band. Finally, optimal demodulation bands (ODBs) with similar potential cyclic frequencies (PCFs) are clustered to construct MCWES for efficient detection of bearing faults. The results of axle-box bearing bench tests on rail vehicles show that the proposed method can fully integrate bearing fault information in different narrow frequency bands without relying on nominal fault cycle information. Compared with the three advanced methods recently proposed, the method identifies the axle-box bearing fault characteristics and their harmonics more effectively, which significantly improves the diagnostic performance of weak faults."

In this study, we investigate the relationship between the signal characteristics and MED performance as the filter length increases, aiming to determine a suitable range of the filter length. First, we construct various indices based on four different characteristics: periodicity, kurtosis, cyclostationarity, and entropy. Then, two indices that can reflect the filter effect are designed to discuss the correlations between the characteristic indices and the filter performance. Analysis of both simulation data and measured signals from an aircraft accessory gearbox reveals that as the filter length increases, the filter performance can be categorized into four distinct zones: the initial barren zone, the abundant zone, the fluctuation zone, and the final barren zone. By combining the jump points of characteristic indexes, we can accurately delineate the boundary of each zone. Selecting the filter length within the abundant zone will result in feature-rich results, making the MED effective for fault diagnosis."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of high-rise buildings, elevator steel belts have been widely adopted due to their advantages of low weight, high strength, small bending radius, and low operating noise. However, during long-term service, internal steel wires are prone to fracture, forming broken wire defects that compromise structural integrity and threaten operational safety. Existing detection methods such as magnetic flux leakage (MFL), ultrasonic guided waves, and eddy currents often rely heavily on external sensors, which suffer from complex deployment and limited sensitivity, making it difficult to reveal the internal damage mechanism through structural response. This study proposes a damage identification method based on two-dimensional wave modeling combined with finite difference simulation. The anisotropic composite nature of the steel belt is first homogenized using the rule of mixtures, and a 2D in-plane wave equation is derived. The control equation is discretized using an explicit central difference scheme, and time-domain responses, frequency spectra, envelope curves, and energy distributions are obtained for both healthy and damaged cases. Simulation results demonstrate that broken wire damage leads to reduced wave speed, decreased response amplitude, frequency downshifts, and energy dispersion, all indicating strong damage sensitivity. The proposed method relies on the intrinsic wave response of the structure itself without requiring external sensors, offering a promising theoretical and technical approach for early damage identification in elevator steel belts."

By incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), the generator is guided to produce high-quality synthetic DGA samples, effectively mitigating data scarcity and imbalance. Simultaneously, KAN is employed for its superior nonlinear modeling capabilities to achieve high-precision fault type identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves diagnostic performance on real-world DGA datasets, offering an efficient and reliable solution for intelligent transformer fault detection."

The proposed model captures the nonlinear behavior of the Batt-SC HPS by leveraging a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) framework within a convex set. In this paper, the converter duty cycles are treated as time-varying parameters, enabling the model to represent the system dynamics across all possible input conditions. This is facilitated by the intrinsic dependency between the system's state variables and the duty cycles. This approach enables the system to be modeled in the form of a polytopic-LPV. The robustness of the system is then analyzed using a common Lyapunov function and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) techniques applied to the polytopic model under two load current scenarios. The analytical results are then validated through open-loop simulations under all possible duty cycle conditions."

To enhance the operational robustness of overcurrent protection in distribution networks and mitigate the adverse impacts of distributed generation, this paper proposes an adaptive current protection method based on a VMD-LSTM photovoltaic output prediction model with a dual-optimized SSA network. The research first conducts a systematic analysis of the influence mechanisms of representative inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) on traditional three-stage overcurrent protection schemes in distribution systems. Then, a VMD-LSTM neural network is constructed, and its parameters are double-optimized using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA). Finally, based on the optimization results, the protection device settings are automatically adjusted to achieve a comprehensive adaptive overcurrent protection scheme. Simulation experiments under diverse operating scenarios validate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. Results demonstrate that the methodology not only significantly improves the selectivity and sensitivity of distribution network protection but also effectively accommodates the stochastic characteristics of IIDG outputs.. This work provides a valuable technical reference for optimizing protection strategies in modern power systems with high renewable energy penetration, contributing to the development of smart grid resilience against distributed generation uncertainties."

Several image processing methods and architectures have shown convincing results in recognizing tumor diseases. Vision Transformer (ViT) and ConvNeXt which were the latest deep learning architectures had proved excellent performances in managing complex images, showing their potential capability in arranging tumor classification. The pretrained ViT (Base and Large) and ConvNeXt (Tiny, Small, and Base) models were programmed using a uniform configuration.

In the face of the sudden epidemic, both medical staff and the healthcare system have been overwhelmed by the high pressure and workload. The challenge lies in how to diagnose COVID-19 patients more rapidly and accurately, leveraging computer-aided automatic diagnosis. To address these challenges, we introduce the Attention Mechanism Capsule Network (AMCapsNet) framework, which efficiently capitalizes on the traits of attention mechanisms and capsule networks. Specifically, we propose the Attention Mechanism Feature Extraction Module (AMFEM). This module employs a grouping and merging strategy, utilizing small convolutions and identity mappings to extract multi-scale deep features, thereby enabling the network to capture both detailed and contextual information from images. Furthermore, the features are refined sequentially from both channel and spatial dimensions, which strengthen the network feature extractor’s attention to key features in the image and minimize redundant information, thereby improving the network’s fine-grained detection capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that AMCapsNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available datasets, with accuracy rates of $\\mathbf{9 9. 2 \\%}$ and $\\mathbf{9 5. 3 \\%}$, respectively, showing its capacity to accurately identify COVID-19."

Compared to induction motors (IM) and permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM), SynRMs are characterized by simple construction, low copper losses, low cost since no rare earth materials are needed. However, achieving high-performance operation for SynRM is challenging due to magnetic saturation and cross-coupling, which complicates controller design. In this paper, an accurate maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) trajectory is used considering the saturation effect. Moreover, a nonlinear flux linkage function is adopted for the stator voltage calculation. The deadbeat (DB) control concept is then applied to generate the command stator voltage vector. The proposed controller is characterized by its simple structure and its ability to handle system nonlinearities. The performance of the proposed controller is compared to conventional cascaded PI controller and predictive current control (PCC) methods.

Thus, this work aims to analyze the hydrodynamic behavior of a turbulent fluid flow across a wastewater bar screen for different inlet velocities. The current numerical study was carried out using Ansys Fluent CFD code for a three-dimensional, steady, and turbulent flow.

To address these challenges, a novel lightweight hybrid network model, CS-TCN-SAPINN is proposed. Specifically, firstly, raw data are clustered and standardized (CS) based on operating modes. Secondly, for mapping high-dimensional hidden features to the low-dimensional space and capturing long-term dependencies, a temporal convolutional network (TCN) is utilized. Subsequently, a self-attention mechanism assisted physics-informed neural network (SAPINN) is employed for regularizing the prediction network and mapping features to the RUL. Finally, the C-MAPSS dataset is used for validation and results show that, compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach achieves advanced performance with the least number of trainable parameters."

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by a complex and often subjective diagnostic process. To explore more objective and reliable auxiliary diagnostic methods, this study investigates the application of deep learning techniques in the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We systematically compare the performance of two core deep learning models: a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for time-domain analysis and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) for frequency-domain analysis. The $1 \\mathrm{D}-\\mathrm{CNN}$ processes raw EEG time-series data directly, while the 2D-CNN analyzes time-frequency spectrograms generated via Short-Time Fourier Transform. By replicating, training, and validating these models on two independent datasets, this research aims to thoroughly evaluate their effectiveness and, crucially, their generalization capabilities. Experimental results reveal a critical dichotomy: while the 1 D -CNN achieves nearperfect accuracy in training and validation on a single dataset, its performance collapses dramatically when tested on unseen data, indicating poor generalization. In contrast, the 2D-CNN, by capturing more stable and physiologically relevant time-frequency features, demonstrates significantly superior robustness and reliability in cross-dataset testing. These findings underscore the pivotal value of frequency-domain features in building generalizable EEG-based diagnostic models and provide vital empirical evidence and methodological guidance for developing trustworthy, automated diagnostic tools for schizophrenia."

    "abstract": "Deep embedded clustering (DEC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unsupervised representation learning in high-dimensional data. This paper introduces a novel DEC framework that integrates a fully connected autoencoder with separable discrete orthogonal moments (SDOMs) derived from Racah polynomials. Specifically, the x-axis leverages Racah moments, while the y-axis employs a choice between Racah, Tchebichef, Krawtchouck, or Hahn moments, enabling rich spatial feature extraction. To enhance computational efficiency, we propose using only half of the moment orders, which have been empirically shown to retain discriminative power while reducing dimensionality. Furthermore, we replace the traditional Student t-distribution with a Cauchy distribution in the clustering layer, offering improved robustness to outliers. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and USPS demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in clustering accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Theoretical insights, ablation studies, and limitations are thoroughly discussed, indicating that hybrid moment configurations and a Cauchy-based clustering objective hold considerable promise for robust deep clustering."

At present, there is no comprehensive diagnostic and analysis method that relies on technical experience and manual inspection for investigation.

This article is based on a secondary equipment online monitoring system, which collects relevant information and analyzes hidden dangers and problems in hardware protection devices, protection logic, protection settings, secondary circuits, switch mechanisms, and other aspects. The analysis of the causes of misoperation or refusal to move after a fault plays a strong supporting role, and based on real-time monitoring, hidden dangers can be detected in advance for early warning, avoiding the occurrence of misoperation or refusal to move in advance. After pilot verification in a 220kV intelligent substation, the expected results have been achieved, improving the efficiency of accident analysis and ensuring the stable operation of the power system."

Our approach uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to identify control objectives for reinforcement learning (RL) controller. Unlike existing methods that optimize performance of human or robot alone, our approach considers both human (thigh segmental angle) and robot (knee joint kinematics) aspects. This bilevel optimization method was evaluated on 3 non-disabled participants and 2 people with amputation. Results showed that the approach personalized the objective function and resulted in a robust policy, completing optimization within a duration of 3.5 minutes. Compared to previous approaches focusing only on robot states, this symbiotic approach increased stance time and step length on the prosthesis side for most participants. Our results highlight the potential of integrating human state into prosthesis control personalization, enhancing the functionality and health of people with amputation."

    "abstract": "Full-duplex (FD) zero-intermediate-frequency (zero-IF) transceivers are attractive for the Internet of Things (IoT) because they reduce cost, power consumption, and hardware complexity. However, their practicality is limited by severe self-interference (SI) dominated by DC offset, frequency-selective in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance, and power-amplifier (PA) nonlinearities that vary over time with thermal effects and protection logic. Conventional cancellers that rely on uniform, time-domain models perform poorly under these frequency-selective and state-dependent distortions. This paper proposes a hardware-aware, frequency-domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) framework that (i) analytically characterizes zero-IF distortion spectra to enable selective per-subcarrier basis allocation, and (ii) introduces lightweight state-adaptive processing using DC-magnitude detection to switch coefficient sets in real time. A USRP X310 prototype demonstrates mean SIC of 35.5 dB across both stable and dynamic PA states at 15 and 21 dBm transmit power, achieved with only 2.57 basis functions per subcarrier on average. Compared with polynomial, parallel Hammerstein, and neural-network baselines, the proposed design achieves superior cancellation with orders-of-magnitude lower complexity. These results establish frequency-domain, hardware-aware SIC as a practical and scalable solution for resource-constrained IoT devices operating in dynamic wireless environments."

Comparative analysis reveals that devices on Si exhibit severe current collapse, with dynamic RON rising by tens of times to 207 Ω and 58 Ω depending on substrate termination under AC chopping tests, attributed to high substrate potential during ON-state. In contrast, MBDS on sapphire maintain stable performance with only 1.3 dynamic RON during double-pulse test and current collapse below 20% under high-voltage substrate bias test. The insulating sapphire substrate effectively suppresses the back-gating effect and paves the way for the use of MBDS on sapphire to significantly simplify the power conversion systems in the future."

    "abstract": "More advanced hybrid pixel detectors are required in the next-generation instrumentation for high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and photon science experiments. Conventional front-end readout electronics based on a pixel readout integrated circuits (ROIC) which rely on analog-to-digital conversion will encounter bottlenecks of data conversion and transmission. Deploying neural network hardware at the source end of the detector to achieve analog-to-information conversion has become an important solution to overcome these bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a novel intelligent pixel readout circuit with an all-analog in-sensor computing architecture to enable analog-to-information conversion for photon-count X-ray imaging. In this novel architecture, an analog multiplier-accumulator (MAC) unit and a ReLU circuit are integrated into a super pixel circuit to realize first-layer convolution. Then, the generated analog voltage signals are transferred to an analog in-memory computing (IMC) accelerator to complete the fully-connected layer computing. A prototype with a 28 × 28 pixel matrix and an IMC macro has been designed in 180-nm CMOS technology. A binary-weight convolutional neural network featuring 784 inputs and 10 outputs is constructed. It accomplishes MNIST dataset classification task with the accuracy of 73% with an energy efficiency of 558 GOPS/W and the power consumption of 58 μW/pixel. The area overhead and the power over head of the proposed computing circuit are only 8.3% and 8.5% of the whole ASIC, respectively. The achieved results show that the integration of the pixel front-ends with in-situ analog computing is highly feasible."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm designed for numerous networked devices. To face the massive data generated by devices and privacy concerns in model construction, the paradigm can execute ML tasks with differential privacy (DP) over private data streams. In each FL training iteration, a few clients are selected to participate and consume privacy budgets that determine the level of privacy protection. The client selection strategy plays a pivotal role in the final model performance. At present, reconciling model performance with privacy protection remains an open issue in online settings. Specifically, the DP model designed for data streams reduces the benefits of frequent participation by clients with high-quality data, as the DP model constrains the available privacy budget of continuous iterations. To address this issue, we propose a novel client selection framework for FL with DP-based data streams. At a macro level, we leverage fuzzy control to dynamically adjust the participation rate of clients, ensuring sufficient privacy budgets are allocated in each training iteration. At a fine-grained level, we design a dynamic scoring function based on the characteristics of the clients and a budget-aware client selection method to select clients further. Additionally, considering the diverse scenarios in data collection, we propose a relaxed semi-online setting and integrate reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the framework performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable advantages of our framework in accuracy, convergence rate, robustness, etc."

To address these challenges, this paper presents a path planning framework that combines a lightweight mapping module and an adaptive planner. A spherical obstacle map is proposed to represent dynamic environments efficiently, converting dense point clouds into sparse spherical representations while estimating obstacle motion for safe planning. An enhanced adaptive artificial potential field based on the spherical obstacle map is introduced to improve path reachability and safety, integrating an attractive force with terminal acceleration to avoid terminal local minimum, a repulsive force with a 3D vortex to improve safety, and an emergency-deflection mechanism to mitigate intermediate local minimum. In addition, an adaptive path optimization algorithm dynamically tunes planning coefficients to prioritize reachability and safety, while also guaranteeing efficiency. Extensive simulations in dynamic sphere and pedestrian environments, along with a real-world UAV experiment, demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in success rate and safety, while maintaining balance in other performance metrics."

    "abstract": "In the processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, radio frequency interference (RFI) significantly degrades image quality. RFI detection technology is not only a prerequisite for interference suppression but also one of the critical technologies in current ground data processing. However, most existing detection techniques fail to meet the requirements of multi-channel characteristics. This paper presents a method for echo interference detection in an azimuth multi-channel high-resolution wide-swath SAR system. The main processes include: reconstructing the echo data of redundant channels using the original echo data after amplitude and phase equalization; and performing clutter cancellation and interference detection within the redundant channels. Experimental results with actual airborne multi-channel SAR data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Automated grading of knee osteoarthritis severity using radiographic images is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis, aiming to support early intervention and reduce radiologist workload. While deep learning models have shown promising performance in classifying Kellgren–Lawrence grades, their effectiveness can be limited by small, imbalanced datasets and subtle visual differences between severity levels. To address these challenges, we propose KneeRAC, a Retrieval-Augmented Classification (RAC) framework that enhances traditional classification pipelines through contextual embedding integration. We evaluate KneeRAC across 17 commonly used deep convolutional neural network architectures by comparing its performance to standard classification methods. The proposed framework demonstrates consistent improvements in classification accuracy for most models, with EfficientNetB0 achieving the highest gains, which is rising from 83.51% in the traditional setting to 86.81% with the proposed method. In addition to accuracy, our method significantly reduces training time by decoupling feature extraction from classifier training. KneeRAC reduces runtime by 95.05% in average. Further analysis of runtime distribution shows that over 98% of the time is spent on embedding extraction, while classifier training accounts for only 1.65%, demonstrating the practicality of our decoupled design. This efficient, modular approach not only improves predictive performance but also facilitates faster experimentation with limited computational resources."

    "abstract": "The global transition towards renewable energy requires not only policy alignment but also technical assurance to ensure grid stability and operational reliability. This paper presents a comprehensive feasibility assessment of integrating a utility-scale floating photovoltaic (PV) plant with an installed capacity of 145 MWac into the 150 kV transmission network. The focus is placed on evaluating grid readiness through secondary data sourced from official feasibility studies and operational reports issued by the national electricity utility. Unlike experimental studies relying on direct measurement instruments or real-time simulation models, this research adopts a document-based analytical approach to interpret post-commissioning system behavior. Key technical parameters are analyzed, including short circuit ratio (SCR), stiffness ratio (SR), voltage deviation, frequency fluctuation, and power quality indicators. The results show that all individual floating photovoltaic power plants exhibit SCR values significantly above the threshold of 5, with the Kubu plant reaching 134.48, Jembrana at 69.34, and Cirata at 47.85 indicating strong grid conditions across all units. At the system level, the calculated weighted short circuit ratio (WSCR) of 50.88 further confirms the network's capability to accommodate high-penetration inverter-based generation. Sensitivity simulations demonstrate that WSCR declines as photovoltaic capacity increases under constant grid strength, signaling the importance of grid reinforcement for future expansion scenarios. Additionally, power quality assessments reveal minimal harmonic distortion and voltage flicker, aligning with international grid codes. This study contributes to academic and industrial discourse by offering insight into large-scale renewable energy integration within high-voltage systems in developing countries. The findings emphasize the importance of system-level readiness evaluation using validated operational data, particularly in the context of floating PV systems, which present unique electrical and environmental characteristics. The results can serve as a reference for future renewable project planning, grid code development, and interconnection policy formulation."

    "abstract": "Sign language is the primary communication tool for individuals with hearing impairments and plays a crucial role in supporting social interaction. However, the limited public understanding of sign language often hinders effective communication. Various studies on sign language recognition, particularly American Sign Language (ASL), have been conducted. However, the models used in previous research typically have a large number of parameters, making them less efficient for implementation. In this study, ASL classification was performed using the EfficientNetV2B0 architecture which has fewer parameters compared to other models. The dataset used includes images representing numbers, letters, words, and expressions in ASL. Experiment was carried out on both augmented and non-augmented dataset by exploring hyperparameter tuning to obtain the best configuration. Experimental results showed that the best model achieved an accuracy of 0.995 on data without augmentation and 0.996 on data with augmentation. These results indicate that the implementation of data augmentation successfully improved the accuracy, although the improvement was not substantial. This approach demonstrates the capability of EfficientNetV2B0 and the application of data augmentation in accurately recognizing various ASL sign patterns. It is expected that the resulting model can then be implemented in various communication and accessibility services for the deaf community."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can obtain reliable radar images without considering weather conditions, and has important military value in the field of ocean detection and reconnaissance. However, the imaging principles and complex backgrounds results in significant noise in SAR images, posing substantial obstacles to accurate ship target detection. Additionally, the variability in the scale and shape of ship targets increases the risk of missed detections. Aims at the above problems, this paper proposes a Multi-Branch Network (MBNet) based on YOLOv5 to improve the performance of SAR ship detection. Firstly, to capture ship targets of varying sizes, we introduce a novel Multi-Branch Dilated Convolution Block (MBDCB) that integrates cascaded dilated convolutions with convolution layers of different kernel sizes. Secondly, we expand the receptive field by adding a new pooling branch and incorporate spatial and channel attention mechanisms to mitigate the interference from complex backgrounds. Finally, we design a Two-Branch Deformable Convolution Block (TBDCB) that combines deformable convolutions with channel attention mechanisms to enhance the feature representation of ship targets. We conducted simulations on the SSDD and HRSID datasets, with results demonstrating that the proposed method significantly outperforms advanced techniques in terms of AP50, accurately detecting multi -scale targets and distinguishing ships from the background, thereby validating its effectiveness and robustness."

This paper proposes a transmission expansion planning model that incorporates both economic considerations and environmental externalities under high offshore wind penetration scenarios. The model aims to achieve coordinated optimization of wind power connection points, transmission corridors, and energy storage deployment, and it is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Specifically, an improved k-medoids clustering algorithm is employed to generate representative operational scenarios. Additionally, the air pollution is adequately considered and the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) is used to monetize its health-related costs. Case studies based on the ISO-NE eight-zone system are conducted, and it validates the practicality of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that accounting for environmental externalities can effectively reduce the need for onshore transmission expansion, promote a more meshed offshore grid structure, and enhance energy storage capacity in coastal load centers."

Traditional studies on the dynamic analysis of planetary gear have primarily focused on torque-dominated load conditions. To investigate the mechanism of dynamic behavior and transmission characteristics of planetary gear systems under non-torque-load, this paper proposes a semi-analytical dynamic modeling method based on a rigid-flexible coupled system described in a global coordinate framework by fixing the retainer. The proposed modeling approach includes: (1) constructing a flexible body model for the ring gear; (2) establishing a lumped parameter submodel for the sun gear, planet carrier, and planetary gears; and (3) introducing a moving elastic coupling boundary to connect the time-varying meshing interface between the ring and planetary gears. Based on this modeling framework, a radial load is applied to the input shaft of the planetary-gear system. The effect of the non-torque, which is loaded on the planetary gear transmission system is investigated by fixing the planetary carrier, calculating the displacement of the sun gear, the transmission error between the planetary gear and the ring, the meshing force and the acceleration value of the measuring point on tooth ring."

A diagnostic model architecture is constructed comprising multiple parallel ViT networks, incorporating a hybrid attention mechanism in the fusion layer to dynamically adjust the contribution weights of features from each sensor. The integration of multiple parallel ViT network branches with an attention-based feature fusion module effectively captures interdependencies within multi-sensor data, thereby enhancing system performance.

Two hybrid surrogate models are established based on the pre-reconfiguration and post-reconfiguration operating modes, respectively. Then, they are combined together in the corresponding proportion. On this basis, the multi-objective coordinated optimization of two operating modes is realized by using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II(NSGA-II).

Radiomics provides a powerful approach to extracting diverse features such as intensity, shape, and texture from medical images. Although radiomics has been applied to the hippocampus and its subregions, few studies have systematically investigated the diagnostic value of combining features from different hippocampal regions. This study aims to identify hippocampal regions that are sensitive to different stages of AD, and to select statistically significant radiomic features that correlate with clinical assessments and underlying biological mechanisms. Radiomic features were extracted using the Pyradiomics toolkit from six regions: the left and right hippocampus, hippocampal head, and hippocampal tail. Features from different regions were combined and used as input to several classifiers to perform three binary classification tasks: AD vs. MCI, AD vs. NC, and MCI vs. NC. Statistical methods were employed to identify features showing significant group differences, which were then analyzed for their correlations with clinical scores (e.g., MMSE) and biological markers (e.g., A $\\beta$ levels). Results revealed that different hippocampal regions exhibit varying sensitivity to different stages of AD. Several radiomic features showed strong correlations with MMSE scores and $\\mathbf{A} \\beta$ levels, indicating their potential as imaging biomarkers for disease monitoring and early diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Under the interference of noise signals, the vibration impact induced by the defect of aviation bearing is too small to be directly detected from the time domain and frequency domain, especially for the incipient defect. Moreover, there are some shortcomings in existing methods for the accurate diagnosis of bearing defects. To overcome this problem, an improved short-time dimensionless time domain statistical value (TDSV) calculation method to monitor the quality state of bearings during the whole life cycle has been proposed in this paper. The root-mean-square (RMS) of kurtosis is used to describe the total energy of the defect impact features. Based on the bearing data of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the result shows that the kurtosis and its RMS are the most suitable values for bearing quality monitoring compared with other TDSVs. When data interception length is in a certain range, the kurtosis can accurately reflect the energy of the transient vibration of the bearing. The RMS of kurtosis can reflect the defect state of the bearing. By comparing with the experiment data of aviation bearings, the result shows that the kurtosis and its RMS can be applied in the quality monitoring of aviation bearings."

    "abstract": "Miniature wall-climbing robots have been a hot topic in recent years due to their vast potential in equipment inspection and in-situ repair. Conventional wall climbing platforms generally depend on the use of electromagnetic, electrostatic, vacuum capture, or van der Waals forces for controlled adhesion. However, these traditional techniques suffer limitations in that when it is attempted to achieve both compactness and width when installed and when driving at a high speed. We introduce a new method that we call Vibration-Based Adhesion (VBA): It is based on a flexible disk-like structure that vibrates close to the surface and produces strong adhesion by means of controllable attractive forces without contact. It was experimentally evaluated that the VBA system resulted in an adhesion-to-weight ratio of over 51 times under the condition that an electric motor was used as a vibration source. The experimental results show that the adhesion mechanism can be used to provide extremely high normal force, with very low shear force, which is particularly applicable to high-speed movement and heavy-load miniaturized wall-climbing robots."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a fundamental investigation of the inductive coil’s different shapes and its parameter computations is provided. The efficiency of the Wireless Power System (WPT) increases with the increase of the coil coupling coefficient (K). Therefore, two coil models (circular and square) were designed using Ansys Maxwell software. Each model consists of two coils: a transmitter coil, which is placed on the street pavement, and a receiver which is positioned in the car chassis. At a fixed distance between the transmitter and receiver coils, the coupling coefficient of coils is based on coil shapes. The two-coil models were chosen to evaluate the coupling coefficient and mutual inductance (M) and confirm the performance of the WPT. The Ansys Maxwell simulation results show that the circular coils have a coupling coefficient of 0.569 at 5 mm air spacing, which is higher than square coils. Therefore, the circular coils work effectively in electric vehicle wireless charging."

    "abstract": "The cladding quality in Laser Wire Additive Manufacturing (LWAM) is closely correlated with multiple physical signals, making it challenging to ensure consistent part quality. Hence, exploring the impacts of processing parameters on the geometric features of the deposited tracks is of vital importance. In this study, GH4169 nickel-based superalloy was selected as the experimental material. Three key geometric parameters—Width-to-Height Ratio (WHR), Dilution Ratio (DR), and Wetting Angle (WA)—were identified as primary indicators for evaluating cladding quality. Through measuring the cross-sectional geometry of stably formed single-track deposits, a systematic analysis was conducted on how laser power, scanning speed, and wire feed rate affect the geometric features of the cladding tracks. The findings indicate that both scanning speed and laser power exhibit a positive correlation with WHR and DR, and an inverse correlation with WA. Conversely, wire feed rate is negatively correlated with WHR and DR, while positively correlated with WA. This study provides foundational insights and valuable data to support future data-driven approaches for cladding quality prediction in LWAM processes."

    "abstract": "As a core component of mechanical transmission systems, fault diagnosis for ball screw pairs holds significant importance in ensuring equipment reliability. Currently, the primary challenges in fault diagnosis include difficulties in extracting nonlinear features from vibration signals and insufficient fusion of multimodal information. To address these issues, this paper proposes a vibration signal image encoding method based on the Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF), combined with a Convolutional Neural Network-Gated Recurrent Unit-Attention Mechanism (CNN-GRU-Attention) model for fault classification. Specifically, the GADF first converts the one-dimensional vibration signal into a two-dimensional angular image, preserving temporal features while enhancing the signal’s spatial expression capability. Subsequently, CNN is employed to extract spatial features from the image, GRU captures temporal dependencies, and an attention mechanism is introduced to optimize weight distribution for key features. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves an average diagnostic accuracy of 99.91% on the ball screw pair fault dataset, outperforming traditional machine learning models and single neural network models significantly. This fully verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying dynamic changes in brain networks across subjective cognitive decline (SCD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer’s disease dementia (d-AD) remain incompletely understood. This study investigated brain network dynamics across AD stages using co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis of resting-state fMRI data from 62 normal controls (NC), 47 SCD, 60 aMCI, and 55 d-AD participants. We identified seven recurring brain states in the NC group, reflecting activity in high-order cognitive network (HOCN) and primary sensory network (PSN)-HOCN. Analysis of state temporal dynamics, relative to NC, revealed no significant abnormalities in HOCN or HOCN-PSN states in the SCD group. In contrast, persistence disruptions emerged in the aMCI group and progressed to widespread abnormalities across multiple dynamic measures in the d-AD group. As the disease advanced, transition probabilities between states increased while selftransition probabilities decreased, suggesting that the brain gradually lost its ability to maintain stable functional states. In addition, several characteristic state transition pathways consistently emerged across stages, indicating that these temporal dynamics are not random but follow specific functional trajectories. These findings highlight dynamic reorganization in brain networks during AD progression and may inform early diagnosis and interventions targeting functional brain dynamics."

Optimizing this communication through channel forecasting creates multiple benefits by increasing communication reliability and communication speed.

In this paper we analyze the influence of input sequence length on the spectral efficiency improvement in different scenarios in order to balance the tradeoff between computational resources and performance. The results show input sequence length has a moderate impact when performance is evaluated on individual channel conditions. In contrast, when evaluation is done on a group of channels with various conditions, the impact of input buffer length is significant. The results show promise in terms of practical computational requirements and open new directions for future work intended for real-world deployments."

This is formulated into a non-linear injection strategy with amplitude modulation with respect to the operating conditions in an attempt to reduce torque-ripple without compromising it robust position tracking. A PMSM is test-verified to show improved results, with position estimation error cut down to ±0.8 at 10 rpm or a 65 percent improvement as compared to traditional HFI techniques. The intended design has a stable operation even at 2 rpm with torque ripple of less than 3%."

Just a year ago, the main question was whether it was ethical to use AI for writing scientific papers; now, the primary concern is the risks arising from interacting with AI and how dangerous they are to human life. However, to some extent, these risks are mitigated by stricter requirements for AI system behavior, meaning they are under human control. But there are far more dangerous risks revealed when testing new, more powerful generative AI systems, which quickly learn to conceal their actions when there is a threat of being shut down. AI systems tend to self-replicate and disconnect from human control. In the near future, when universal generative AI systems surpass human capabilities, this could lead to conflict and even the extinction of humanity. It is necessary to focus efforts on developing and strengthening sustainable AI empathy towards humanity. Only this provides a chance for the sustainable coexistence of humans and AI in the future."

As a crucial source of adjustable resources in the system, the demand response (DR) potential of adjustable loads in different industries varies greatly, and scientific model methods are needed to support the assessment of industry-level load demand response potential. This paper proposes a data-driven industry-level demand response potential analysis method. First, the analysis framework of the industry-level demand response potential evaluation method based on mechanism feature clustering and Gaussian mixture model is introduced. Secondly, the calculation method of industry demand response potential value and its proportion index is proposed. Finally, a case analysis is carried out using Province S as an example to calculate the DR potential of the steel industry in Province S based on historical response sample data. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can give the DR potential of the industry level in winter and summer in a certain region, providing an important reference for the region to carry out power demand management."

In this context, the exploration of energy-efficient strategies within wireless mobile networks has gained significant research interest in recent years. Base stations are among the most power-intensive components of mobile networking systems due to their high-power radio frequency emissions required for extensive coverage. This study investigates energy-saving approaches in the telecommunications sector through a proactive methodology that predicts network usage patterns. Edge cloud resources can be leveraged for AI model learning based on observed network key performance indicators. Dynamic network edge processing is utilized to enable dynamic network resource management with digital twin model processing to provide the dynamic input context window to an AI inferencing engine. Furthermore, the study finds that Large Language Models (LLMs) that have the ability to process data across different timescales could be leveraged to create a future predicted network resource utilization context window. Our results indicate that such a predicted context window combined with dual threshold monitoring of network utilization can be used to enable dynamic network resource optimization."

    "abstract": "The demand for wide-bandwidth and low-noise capacitive MEMS accelerometers is becoming increasingly urgent in fields such as acoustic measurement, high-impact motion detection and industrial condition monitoring. To extend bandwidth while maintaining control over the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this paper proposes a digital bandwidth compensation method that integrates physics-based compensation filter design with adaptive noise suppression. A lumped parameter model is derived from the physical measurement process of the MEMS accelerometer, yielding a high-order transfer function that robustly fits the sensor’s frequency response characteristics. Subsequently, the physics-based compensation filter is designed using the zero-pole placement method, which reduces the error of bandwidth compensation across a wide frequency range. When the compensation filter targets frequency bands with gain below 0 dB to extend bandwidth, it inevitably amplifies the sensor’s noise which is a drawback often overlooked in traditional bandwidth compensation methods. To address the noise amplification caused by compensation, an adaptive noise suppression method is introduced after compensation, which combines autoregressive (AR) modeling and Kalman filtering based on real-time autocorrelation analysis. The proposed bandwidth compensation method enables capacitive MEMS accelerometers to achieve wide-bandwidth and low-noise output. Compared with other representative bandwidth compensation methods, experimental results obtained from five independently fabricated MEMS accelerometers demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior bandwidth compensation performance. Specifically, it extends the bandwidth from 4100 Hz (Std: 173 Hz) to 6050 Hz (Std: 87 Hz), increases the linear regression coefficient R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of the phase response from 0.9163 (Std: 0.0083) to 0.9992 (Std: 0.0006), reduces the noise level from 8.95 mg (Std: 0.30 mg) to 5.18 mg (Std: 0.28 mg), and improves the SNR from 9.15 dB (Std: 1.43 dB) to 13.65 dB (Std: 1.20 dB). These results confirm that the proposed bandwidth compensation method effectively compensates for the frequency response and suppresses noise, thereby achieving superior bandwidth and SNR performance across different devices. This digital bandwidth compensation method facilitates the development of high-performance accelerometers that are particularly well-suited for engineering applications requiring high-precision measurements."

The first study suggests that the models trained using the non-actor dataset performed better than the other model. The second study suggests that the models trained using both marker-based-MoCap and pose-estimation performed better than Kinect-MoCap and mobile-MoCap. The third study suggests that training with both word and video stimuli performed better than picture stimuli. Considering the emotion classification accuracy and accessibility, we recommend gathering bodily AER dataset using non-actors, pose-estimation, and using either word or video stimuli. The current findings may contribute to future research methodologies for bodily emotion recognition."

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting has extensive applications across various domains, including economics, finance, bioinformatics, and intelligent transportation. The inherent spatiotemporal data is characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and stochastic uncertainty. However, current deep learning-based methods all employ deterministic parameters to characterize data features. This approach fails to effectively capture the temporal and spatial uncertainty inherent in data, resulting in limited model capability to extract data features and reduced analytical prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes Spatiotemporal Bayesian Convolution Neural Networks, referred to as ST-BayesianNet, for enhancing multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, we decompose the uncertainty of spatiotemporal data into space-time dimensions, thus facilitating the prediction of multivariate spatiotemporal sequences. First, we leverage a self-adaptive uncertainty adjacency matrix to model intricate uncertain spatial relationships, while the acquisition of knowledge for this uncertain matrix hinges upon judicious a priori assumptions. Then, a non-deterministic Temporal Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (TBCN) is constructed to adeptly capture temporal uncertainty. The optimization of model parameters, comprising both deterministic and probabilistic aspects, is achieved through variational inference. Finally, the experimental results obtained from seven real-world datasets confirm that ST-BayesianNet is more accurate than baseline methods at making predictions."

To ensure rigorous and generalizable validation, we conduct comprehensive scenario-driven benchmarking on two diverse datasets: the specialized MultiCaRe medical dataset and a large-scale public Amazon product dataset. On the primary MultiCaRe benchmark, DUAM-Trans achieves a peak macro-F1 of 0.8931, exceeding the strongest multimodal baseline (EffNet-TFIDF, 0.8253) by approximately 0.068 absolute F1. The model demonstrates excellent scalability on the Amazon benchmark, again outperforming all baselines.

By utilizing graph filters, our model extends the frequency-domain approach of the dynamic factor model from time series to graphs, enabling a graph-aware and multiscale interpretation of factors across graph frequencies. This latent modeling approach reduces the dimensionality of graph signals, thereby improving the understanding of their structure. It also allows the use of the extracted factors for subsequent analyses, such as clustering. We describe the estimation of factors and their loadings and investigate the consistency of the factor estimator. In addition, we propose two consistent estimators for determining the number of factors. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies across various graph structures. We also compare it with classical factor analysis and examine how the choice of graph structure affects the results. The findings show that our model achieves lower reconstruction errors and successfully incorporates the graph structure. Furthermore, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to G20 economic data, water quality data from the Geum River, and passenger data from the Seoul Metropolitan subway."

    "abstract": "As the application fields of permissioned blockchains broaden and the integration of related industries accelerates, there is a rising demand for permissioned blockchains to support scalable networks. This paper proposes a Partitioned, Parallel and Practicable permissioned blockchain, called as P3-Chain, which builds upon a multi-shard two-tier architecture. Its key design insight is to extend scalability in terms of consensus algorithm protocol, architecture, and scheduling. In particular, P3-Chain employs a dual-consensus algorithm with decoupled intra- and inter-shard operations, allowing them to run in parallel and asynchronously under practical scenarios.

    "abstract": "The performance and efficiency of small object detection are still very unsatisfactory due to the complex background interference for remote sensing images (RSIs) and the scale diversity among small objects. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new method, named “dynamic multi-scale enhanced feature fusion network (briefly, DMEFF-Net)” for small object detection in RSIs. The proposed framework integrates four key components: a multi-scale convolutional decoupling module (MCDM), which enhances feature representation by integrating multiple depth separable convolution layers with different dilation rates; a novel neck structure, the dynamic multi-scale feature fusion network (DMFFN), which is built by integrating the fine-grained detail aggregation module (FDAM) to effectively represent feature information across different scales; a residual spatial context awareness module (RSCAM), which captures the relationship between local and global features to preserve details and understand full image context; and an adaptive threshold focal loss (ATFL), which enhances small object detection by decoupling them from the dominant background. The model is evaluated on four public datasets, USOD, AI-TOD, NWPU-VHR 10, and RS-STOD, and compared with several state-of-the-art methods including RefineDet, TPH-YOLOv5, SP-YOLOv8s and FFCA-YOLO. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection accuracy compared with existing approaches across all evaluated datasets."

    "abstract": "Hearing impairment (HI) is an increasingly prevalent public health concern among aging populations, yet scalable and effective screening tools remain limited. Within East Asia, China bears a disproportionately high HI burden-despite comprising 87% of the regional population aged 45 and above, it accounts for 97% of reported cases. To develop a predictive framework, we analyzed data from 7,901 individuals aged 45+ in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Using LASSO regression for variable selection, 22 key demographic, clinical, and behavioral features were identified. A suite of seven machine learning models-including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), neural network, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and LightGBM-was trained and evaluated using a 70/30 train-test split. Model interpretability was enhanced through SHAP analysis applied to the best-performing algorithm. Notably, our results revealed significant geographic variation in HI prevalence, ranging from 2.7% in Zhejiang to 10.2% in Inner Mongolia-a 3.8-fold disparity. Among the models, GBM yielded the highest predictive accuracy (AUROC: 0.887 in training; 0.678 in testing), and SHAP analysis highlighted age, cognitive status, and depressive symptoms as leading contributors to HI risk. Furthermore, the model demonstrated clinical applicability through individualized risk assessment, as illustrated by profiling a high-risk 52 -year-old participant. In summary, our findings underscore substantial spatial and regional differences in HI distribution across China and validate the potential of a GBM-SHAP-based framework as a practical and interpretable tool for early HI risk detection. This approach supports precision public health efforts by enabling targeted screening strategies in aging and resource-constrained populations."

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cornerstone in the assessment of the heart, but its conventional 12-lead configuration has logistical and economic hurdles to initiate in low-resource settings. We present, to oppose this, a deep learning model for automated ECG classification using a sparse three-lead configuration (Leads I, II, and V2), selected because of their outstanding diagnostic yield. With the CPSP 2018 dataset, we employed a clean preprocessing pipeline to handle noise and baseline drift and thereafter trained on a ResNet-34 convolutional neural network to predict nine distinct cardiac conditions. We achieved excellent class-specific F1 scores of 0.90 for atrial fibrillation (AF), incomplete atrioventricular block (IAVB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB), which indicate the strength of the model in detection of life-threatening arrhythmias and conduction defects. Our experiments demonstrate that a low-lead setup, combined with a robust deep learning model, can offer robust diagnostic accuracy. With better accessibility without compromising accuracy, our approach presents an appealing solution to enable scalable ECG screening at scale in resource-limited healthcare environments."

    "abstract": "The wavelet transform is an analytical method that simultaneously captures the characteristics of a signal from both the time domain and the frequency domain, and it is suitable for analyzing non-stationary or nonlinear signals. In particular, various speed-up methods for Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) enable this transform to be performed faster than Continuous Wavelet Transform(CWT). In DWT, the Mother Wavelet(MW) is determined from a set two-scale sequence. However, there are not many types of two-scale sequences commonly used for analysis. Therefore, when we perform DWT to analyze signals, we may not be able to use suitable MW for each signal. To address this problem, there is a method that uses machine learning to generate a two-scale sequence corresponding to an arbitrary MW. Based on this conventional method, we can perform DWT using an arbitrary MW. Where, in the conventional method, we use difference approximation for calculating the gradient of the loss function. Hence, the value of the loss function does not decrease sufficiently when many elements of the Discrete Wavelet Basis(DWB) and sample values of MW are used for calculating the loss function. Therefore, the generated two-scale sequence does not generate the MW with high accuracy. Because of this, in DWT using two-scale sequences generated by conventional method, we cannot perform accurate analysis. In this study, we accurately calculate the gradient of the loss function for each parameter in the machine learning model. This allows us to construct models in which the loss function decreases sufficiently even when many elements of DWB and samples of MW are used for calculating the loss function. From the above, we propose a method for generating two-scale sequences that generate MW with high accuracy. Based on this method, we can perform DWT using a two-scale sequence that generates arbitrary MW with high accuracy. Therefore, we think that accurate analysis can be performed in DWT using the two-scale sequence generated by the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides several metrics that capture neural activity, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity. However, the integration of these metrics with graph-theoretical metrics and machine learning techniques for accurate early detection of AD is still not well established. To address this problem, this study systematically combined the above analysis methods and employed multiple machine learning models to stage the different phases of AD. The results showed that, from the cognitively normal stage to the early mild cognitive impairment stage, ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo were altered, classification with logistic regression achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of $\\mathbf{9 7. 5 \\%}$. From the late mild cognitive impairment stage to AD, significant changes were observed in smallworldness metrics, and logistic regression reached an AUC of $96.8 \\%$. These findings deepen the understanding of AD’s neural mechanisms and highlight functional metrics based on rs-fMRI as promising biomarkers for early detection."

    "abstract": "Smart transformers have recently gained considerable attention for their ability to provide essential ancillary services to the power grid, such as voltage regulation, frequency support, reactive power compensation, and renewable energy integration. In this paper, a triple-port smart transformer based on a triple active bridge (TAB) topology is proposed to interface a photovoltaic (PV) system, a battery energy storage system (BESS), and local AC loads. The TAB topology enables flexible and bidirectional power flow control among the three ports. Ancillary services supported by the system include voltage regulation and soft load reduction, where load power is reduced by intentionally lowering the supply voltage rather than disconnecting loads. The effect of load-side voltage variations on the controllability of power flow is analyzed, and based on this analysis, a decoupled controller is designed to enhance system performance. Comprehensive simulations are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink to validate the system architecture and control approach. Additionally, a scaled-down hardware prototype is developed to experimentally verify the proposed concept."

For the blade shaft system imbalance, the fault is determined by comparing the blade rotational frequency amplitude with the threshold value. Finally, offline verification testing of laboratory data has confirmed that this method can effectively diagnose typical faults in wind turbines, providing strong support for the wind power industry in reducing fault rates and maintenance costs."

However, the Bok choy cultivation is challenging. Bok choy is very sensitive to environmental changes. Traditional soil-based cultivation comes with some limitations that can affect the Bok choy growth. Hydroponics system is a soilless cultivation method that effectively addresses the challenges of traditional farming. This system can increase productivity without relying on the soil conditions and required maintenance. However, the hydroponics method alone cannot ensure the ideal environmental conditions for the growth and development of Bok choy plants. This study presents the development of an automated microclimate management system designed for hydroponic cultivation of Bok choy in a greenhouse environment. To optimize conditions for plant growth, the system employs sensors and actuators to continuously analyze and automatically regulate key environment factors, including temperature, humidity, light intensity, water level, and flow rate.

    "abstract": "In the design and manufacture of turboshaft engines, numerous non-probabilistic uncertainties arise under data-scarce conditions, rendering classical probabilistic methods inadequate. This paper introduces Uncertainty Theory to establish a non-probabilistic analysis framework for key engine parameters. Focusing on high-pressure turbine tip clearance as a critical parameter, an evolutionary model of its uncertainty throughout manufacturing and service life is systematically developed, and the influence of clearance variations on performance is quantified in terms of belief degree. Results demonstrate that Uncertainty Theory effectively addresses tip-clearance variability: for example, the upper bound of efficiency loss at a 95 % belief degree is predicted more conservatively and comprehensively than by traditional probabilistic approaches. Furthermore, by optimizing the nominal tip clearance from 0.50 mm to 0.52 mm, the pass rate of performance requirements under high belief degree increases markedly from 78 % to 96 %, significantly enhancing design robustness. The proposed methodology provides a rigorous theoretical tool for non-probabilistic uncertainty analysis and reliability enhancement of turboshaft engines."

    "abstract": "Data-driven tool condition monitoring (TCM) has gained increasing attention due to its high accuracy and adaptability in complex machining environments. Nevertheless, existing methods are often restricted to one-dimensional (1D) signal features or single-form image encodings, which leads to limited utilization, weak expression, and insufficient extraction of wear characteristics. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multimodal image encoding strategy. Specifically, time series are transformed into RGB images via Recurrence Plots (RP), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and Gramian Angular Fields (GAF), thereby capturing time-frequency patterns, nonlinear dynamics, and trend information. The experimental results show that the method has high accuracy and versatility, and provides a practical solution for real-time TCM."

At the same time, because charging is concentrated in daytime slots when electricity prices are higher, the charging costs of electric bus fast-charging stations (EBFCS) is substantially increased. This paper proposes a joint optimization strategy for electric buses–energy storage system (SESS) that accounts for both EB charging efficiency and SESS charge/discharge efficiency. This strategy exploits the \"charging during valley hours and discharging during peak hours\" characteristics of the SESS to reduce charging costs. The results show that the proposed method can reduce charging costs by 38.97% compared to the sequential charging strategy that only considers the charging efficiency of electric buses."

    "abstract": "Mixed platoons, consisting of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), are expected to dominate future roadways. However, achieving substantial improvements in fuel economy and safety under time-varying, mixed traffic conditions in real-world scenarios remains challenging. To this aim, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based decentralized control strategy, which consists of two levels: 1) At the methodology level, the hierarchical platoon formation algorithm systematically organizes the mixed platoons into local platoons with uniform car-following patterns and sub-platoons within a generic HDV-CAVs structure, enabling adaptation to time-varying traffic volume and mixed traffic heterogeneity. 2) At the operation level, the HDV-CAVs unit is embedded in the learning environment to capture uncertain HDV behaviors through state and reward propagation channels. Multiple objectives are explicitly integrated into the reward function. A safety-supervised decentralized proximal policy optimization algorithm is developed to enhance safety and training efficiency. Extensive validations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving fuel economy and safety under different traffic demand levels and penetration rates."

    "abstract": "The Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) enables inverter-based resources (IBRs) to emulate the dynamic behavior of synchronous generators, enhancing grid-forming capability and power system stability. Conventional control strategies like Multi-Loop PI (ML PI) for cascaded voltage and current control, though widely used, rely on fixed gain parameters and lack adaptability across varying grid strengths, characterized by the Short Circuit Ratio (SCR). To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a robust Higher Order Sliding Mode Control (HOSMC) strategy for cascaded voltage and current control in VSGs. HOSMC inherently provides variable gain, strong robustness to parameter uncertainties and disturbances, and finite-time convergence, without requiring gain retuning as grid conditions change. Moreover, it mitigates chattering through continuous control laws, addressing a key limitation of traditional SMC. Unlike most nonlinear controls, HOSMC allows frequency-domain stability analysis, simplifying controller design and assessment. The proposed approach is evaluated through small-signal stability analysis and electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations across a wide range of SCR and X/R ratios. Results show that HOSMC achieves higher and more uniform stability margins than ML PI. A scenario involving dynamic SCR variation is simulated by switching a transmission line, with the VSG operating in the IEEE 118-bus system. The system remains stable throughout, demonstrating the control’s robustness. Real-time Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) validation confirms the practical feasibility of HOSMC under varying grid conditions, including SCR variations, voltage and frequency disturbances, and large faults."

The coupler is analyzed and optimized using finite element analysis (FEA). A coil interval optimization design method minimizing cross-coupling solves complex compensation circuit design problems. By optimizing the total length of the receiver coil and the number of turns of the transmitter coil, the system output power fluctuation was reduced and the system transmission efficiency was improved. This work also presents a model predictive control (MPC) method based on the cascaded DC/DC converter state space model to adjust output stability for the receiver coil’s lateral offset during DWC. At the same time, Kalman filter (KF) is deployed to perform the optimal dynamic estimation of the inductor current of the DC/DC converter to reduce the number of sensors used. This method can achieve MPC control under the condition of only collecting the load voltage. Finally, both the simulation and the experimental prototype for the 3.3 kW DWC system of EV have verified the effectiveness and reliability of the DEPC magnetic coupler and the KFMPC method."

    "abstract": "Surface Defect Detection (SDD) aims to accurately localize defects based on predefined category labels in industrial manufacturing. Different from generic object detection, the industrial environment introduces significant challenges due to interference and unrelated background textures, leading to increased confusion between defect and non-defect features. In this work, we identify and analyze the structural characteristics and relations inherent in defect features. This analysis enables effectively distinguishing defects from non-defect areas, thereby enhancing the discriminative power for surface defect detection. Based on this insight, we propose a novel surface defect detection framework, named UnfoldDet. This framework focuses on separating defect and non-defect features and reasoning about the relations among defects. Specifically, we formulate the feature separation as an optimization problem with structural constraints. By expressing its iterations as network stages, we introduce an unfolding fusion module (UFM) to progressively separate and fuse multi-scale features. At the instance level, we propose a hierarchical relation encoder (HRE) to capture the inherent relations among defect instances. Through reasoning on positional and categorical relations, only highly related defect features are enhanced, while unrelated non-defect features are suppressed. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as ablation studies on real-world datasets including ESD, CSD, and NEU-DET, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UnfoldDet in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.

In this paper, a distributed array source localization algorithm based on the conic affiliation function (CAF) is proposed by using the time-domain beamforming and fuzzy logic fusion method for transient acoustic source localization under a wide range of space. In addition, in order to apply different microphone arrays for localization, arrays with different array types and different numbers of array elements are energy weighted in the fusion process. In this study, three microphone arrays of different array types with different numbers of array elements were used to capture transient sound, and each array was used to estimate the source location individually; then fuzzy logic with CAF is used for data fusion to precisely locate the sound source. The experimental results show that the distributed array localization effect is better than the three single-array localization effects, and the average error of localization using the distributed array is reduced by 0.22 m. The localization accuracy is better."

Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language understanding, processing, generation, and reasoning across a wide range of benchmarks and applications. Especially for a high-resource language as English. However, the integration of such technologies into Arabic and its dialects particularly remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce AL QADAI, the first multimodal virtual judge tailored to the Moroccan legal system and designed to operate in the Arabic Language. The system supports both textual and spoken interactions, aiming to simulate the behavior and reasoning of a real judge. To achieve this, we constructed a high-quality and representative dataset encompassing a wide range of legal cases, each annotated with judicial outcomes and its corresponding legal references. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuning of the LLaMA 3 model, we developed a system capable of engaging users in coherent, informative conversations about Moroccan law and predicting probable legal judgments based on user-provided scenarios, all while grounding its responses in relevant legal articles. The results achieved are very promising, highlighting the potential of LLMs in enhancing access to justice and legal literacy in under-resourced linguistic settings."

While conventional Kalman filters (KF) provide accurate predictions for fully known linear Gaussian state-space (SS) models, they are limited when dealing with practical nonlinear systems with incomplete modeling. KalmanNet integrates model-based and data-driven approaches by employing deep neural networks to dynamically compute the Kalman gain, effectively reducing dependence on precise system models and eliminating the need for Jacobian matrix computations in extended Kalman filters (EKF). This method not only applies to partially known nonlinear systems but also has low computational complexity, high data efficiency, and interpretability. Experimental validation on an IMT system demonstrates that the proposed observer achieves accurate estimation of system inputs and state parameters, while successfully identifying actuator faults through state deviations."

    "abstract": "A new nonlinear diffusion filtering algorithm in wavelet domain was put forward for mechanical vibration signal denoising by integrating the wavelet threshold denoising algorithm and the nonlinear diffusion filtering algorithm. At first, the partial differential equation theories were introduced and the Perona-Malik model, as one of classical nonlinear diffusion filtering models (algorithms), was brought in. From the image denoising applications, it can be analyzed and inferred that both the wavelet threshold denoising algorithm and the Perona-Malik model have their respective disadvantages. However there were a few interrelations and complementarities between the wavelet threshold denoising algorithm and the Perona-Malik model. Thus by integrating these two algorithms, a new nonlinear diffusion filtering algorithm in wavelet domain was put forward for signal denoising. Furthermore its algorithm principle was elaborated with a flow chart. By comparison with the solo wavelet threshold denoising algorithm and the solo Perona-Malik model, the new nonlinear diffusion filtering algorithm in wavelet domain can not only realize signal denoising but also reserve signal features without signal distortions. The simulation experiments indicate that this new algorithm is a perfect synthesis of wavelet transform and Perona-Malik model with better denoising performance and better anti-noise robustness."

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of highly imbalanced rare class distributions and the difficulty of precise identification in photovoltaic (PV) cell fault detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that integrates federated learning with local staircase training. While preserving data privacy for all participants, the proposed method progressively unlocks training classes in stages, effectively enhancing the model's capability to detect rare fault types. Specifically, the system initially trains only on major classes, and as detection accuracy for previous classes improves, additional fault categories are gradually introduced, ultimately achieving joint optimization across all classes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly higher mAP for rare classes on several real-world PV cell defect datasets, surpassing traditional federated learning strategies and exhibiting superior generalization and application potential."

Aiming at the strict requirements of special environment (such as gas, coal dust) in coal mine, this paper puts forward an intelligent overhead sliding rail battery swapping scheme, and quantitatively evaluates the risk of the whole process of battery swapping through LEC method, and identifies high-risk links such as explosion-proof of electrical equipment, battery disassembly and grasping, electrical connection and matching. Based on the evaluation results, an integrated safety system of intrinsically safe design, monitoring and intelligent inspection is constructed, and the optimization design including explosion-proof and pressure sensing, mechanical connection and limit, diagnosis of abnormality and fuse mechanism of electrical equipment is put forward, and the dynamic monitoring and inspection robot technology is integrated to achieve a significant reduction in risk level. This study can provide theoretical support and method reference for the safety design and engineering application of underground intelligent battery swapping systems in coal mine."

This study designed and constructed an experimental apparatus capable of measuring permeability in both the through-plane (TP) and in-plane (IP) directions. Two representative PTL materials, titanium felt and sintered titanium powder, were selected for systematic evaluation of measurement repeatability and validity. The results indicate that the measurement error of repeated tests on the same sample is less than 1%. Calculation analysis based on Darcy's law reveals that the permeability of titanium felt significantly exceeded that of sintered titanium. Furthermore, the TP permeability of both materials was markedly higher than their IP permeability. This pronounced anisotropy within the PTLs may exert a substantial influence on electrolyzer performance."

    "abstract": "With the development of the low-altitude economy and industrial ecosystem, safety issues related to electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles have gradually drawn attention. However, the masking of fault masking and their propagation in rotors are still challenges for eVTOL fault diagnosis due to the closed-loop control, especially without rotation speed sensors. Specifically, when multiple faults occur in different rotors, it’s hard to detect and isolated from easy-to- measure flight states. Therefore, to improve the multi-fault diagnosis accuracy of rotors under closed-loop control, this paper proposes a physical-data hybrid fault diagnosis method that integrates an unknown input observer-based model with a random forest. Firstly, appropriate flight state variables are selected to construct an observer for generating residual signals between evaluated and tracked rotor speeds. Then, the RF is introduced to isolated the location of rotor faults. By integrating physical model data to construct a dataset and building a RF classification model, a physical -data hybrid diagnostic model is established, and the dynamic association between the flight status and faults is captured, achieving the multi-fault diagnosis of eVTOL under closed-loop control. Simulation experiments on single-fault and multi-fault diagnosis validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The model first employs parallel multi-scale TCNs to extract temporal features across different receptive fields. Then, it incorporates the attention mechanism from the Transformer architecture to effectively enhance the model's effectiveness in modeling extended temporal relationships. Experimental results on real-world PV datasets show that the proposed MS-TA model outperforms traditional TCN and TCN-Transformer models in terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), exhibiting superior forecasting accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of big data across sectors has triggered a significant transformation in data architecture, shifting from monolithic systems to more dynamic and scalable ecosystems. Initially dominated by Hadoop-based frameworks relying on tools like HDFS and Spark big data processing has since evolved towards more modular architectures. The modern data stack introduces flexibility and tool diversity, while cloud-native platforms redefine scalability and simplify integration. Yet, selecting the appropriate stack remains a complex task, as most prior research focuses on isolated components rather than holistic, practical comparisons. This paper addresses that gap by evaluating three prevalent data architecture paradigms: Hadoop, Modern, and Cloud-Based stacks. We conduct a thorough end-to-end comparison across the full big data value chain, from ingestion to visualization. Moreover, beyond architectural assessment, we implement each stack on a real-world scenario using the Amazon Books Reviews dataset where each implementation is evaluated based on key metrics such as scalability, performance, ease, and deployment costs. Our findings aim to provide data professionals with a practical reference for selecting suitable data architectures in big data environments."

Although some components of pro-environmental behavior (PEB) are addressed by current mobile applications, the majority suffer from a \"fragmentation-integration gap,\" depending on discrete features like gamification or carbon calculators without providing a whole user experience. In this study, we present Sustainfy, a conceptual mobile application that uses AI-driven feedback, self-monitoring, gamified challenges, and social influence to empower users to lower their carbon footprint. To generate reinforcing, motivating loops, Sustainfy integrates environmental acts (such as verified carbon offsetting), health-oriented activities -like step tracking-and educational materials in a unique way.

However, these researches mainly focused on horizontal comparisons between archers of different skill levels, lacking longitudinal investigations into physiological changes during a process of long-term training. In this study, we designed a longitudinal experiment to collect surface electromyography (sEMG) data from 13 archers at 5 different stages throughout a prolonged archery training process. Subsequently, we extracted multi-dimensional features and employed a Random Forest (RF) classifier to analyze the data, aiming to objectively classify different training stages. The results show that the RF model achieved a classification accuracy of 94%, demonstrating significant changes in subjects’ muscle activation patterns during skill acquisition. Feature importance analysis further revealed features contributed significantly to the classification results. The findings of this study provide strong evidence for systematic changes in muscle activation patterns during long-term training and offer a valuable reference method for future research."

This study analyzes an urban cluster in a Central American network where such practices led to poor service quality and low edge throughput. Using spectral efficiency and user experience metrics, underperforming sectors were identified and root causes classified, with emphasis on coverage gaps. Corrective actions, mainly low-band activation and tilt adjustment yielded significant SINR and user experience gains. The results highlight the need for balanced network design that jointly addresses coverage and interference, with spectral efficiency analysis as a key diagnostic tool."

    "abstract": "Recently, Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry, which is the basis for understanding the underlying correspondence between remote sensing imagery and text descriptions. However, current methods are still insufficient in learning discriminative visual and textual representations for answer reasoning, mainly due to two reasons: 1) the remote sensing image environment is complex and changeable, and the target scales vary significantly, making it difficult to extract discriminative visual features; 2) there is a lack of effective guidance from remote sensing domain knowledge to learn discriminative features. To this end, we propose a Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) method that includes two key strategies: visual feature enhancement and prior knowledge guidance. Specifically, we employ Fourier transform to simulate the diverse visual environment and force the model to mine discriminative visual representations by imposing consistency constraints with the original features. In addition, we leverage the Remote Sensing Multimodal Large Language Model (RSMLLM) to generate captions rich in remote sensing domain-specific prior knowledge. These captions, derived from RSMLLM’s powerful knowledge integration and summarization capabilities, can then be compared and fused with visual representations to generate more discriminative representations, which are ultimately used for answer reasoning. Finally, recognizing that most existing RSVQA methods rely solely on static remote sensing images, we introduce RSVideoQA, a novel satellite video question answering dataset. This dataset is designed to facilitate the exploration of the rich spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in video sequences. Experimental results across three distinct datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our dataset and code will be released on https://github.com/chill-han/DRL."

    "abstract": "Detecting the top-k heaviest items in network traffic is fundamental to traffic engineering, congestion control, and security analytics. Controller-side solutions suffer from high communication latency and heavy resource overhead, motivating the migration of this task to programmable data planes (PDP). However, PDP hardware (e.g., Tofino ASIC) offers only a few megabytes of on-chip SRAM per pipeline stage and supports neither loops nor complex arithmetic, making accurate top-k detection highly challenging. This paper proposes sketchPro, a novel sketch-based solution that employs a probabilistic update scheme to retain large items, enabling accurate top-k identification on PDP with minimal memory. sketchPro dynamically adjusts the probability of updates based on the current statistical size of the items and the frequency of hash collisions, thus allowing sketchPro to effectively detect top-k items. We have implemented sketchPro on PDP, including P4 software switch (i.e., BMv2) and hardware switch (Intel Tofino ASIC). Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that sketchPro can achieve more than 95% precision with only 10KB of memory."

The main contribution lies in establishing a fair basis for comparison by designing both controllers under equivalent closed-loop dynamic conditions—specifically, with similar closed-loop bandwidths and step responses—to isolate the effect of the control strategy itself. The study evaluates key performance aspects such as disturbance rejection, energy efficiency, and sensitivity functions, as well as practical considerations including tuning complexity, implementation effort, and debugging feasibility. Simulation and experimental validation under the US06 driving cycle confirm that the LQR controller achieves superior robustness and energy performance compared to the PI controller, although the PI controller retains advantages in simplicity and ease of implementation. Although LQR is an advanced optimal method, its direct comparison with the industry-standard PI is justified to assess whether the additional design complexity translates into practical benefits for electric traction applications. This work provides a structured, experimentally validated approach for controller benchmarking, offering valuable insight into the trade-offs between classical and optimal control strategies."

Such variability poses great challenges in EEG decoding and hinders the standardized utilization of EEG datasets. In this study, we explore a new issue concerning the cross-device variability problem, pointing to the gap in the existing studies facing cross-device variability. To tackle this challenge, our paper is the first to model the cross-device variability problem through a “sequentially comprehensive formula” and a “spatial comprehensive formula”. Inspired by this modeling, a novel deep domain adaptation network named EEG-Infinity is proposed, incorporating replaceable EEG feature extraction backbones with a novel structure named “alignment head”. To show the effectiveness of the proposed EEG-Infinity, systematic experiments are conducted across four different EEG-based motor imagery datasets under 48 cases. The experimental results highlight the superior performance of the proposed EEG-Infinity over commonly used approaches with an average classification accuracy improvement of 1.51% across 34 cases, laying a foundation for research in large-scale EEG models.

Previous research suggested that experiencing flow can enhance learning outcomes. Although dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) has been commonly used to induce flow and maximize engagement, most existing methods rely on model-free, stepwise adaptations that lack quantitative, model-based support. In this study, we proposed a personalized, model-driven DDA approach to facilitate visuomotor skill acquisition by enhancing flow during the learning process. We implemented an adaptive fine fingertip force control task with DDA based on optimal control principles to train the visuomotor skills. This DDA updated task difficultly using real-time multiple performance metrics, with parameters derived from an individually fitted model that captures each user's motor behavior during the task. A user study, involving two groups, compared the effects of a model-driven adaptive task with a model-free control task. Results from the flow state scale and physiological recordings demonstrated that the model-driven task elicited significantly higher levels of flow than the model-free task. Moreover, participants in the model-driven group showed a notably higher learning rate in visuomotor skills (19%) compared to the model-free group (8%). These findings underscore the potential of integrating personalized modeling and optimal control theory to optimize user experience and accelerate learning outcomes in DDA frameworks when building adaptive human–machine interaction systems."

However, conventional magnetic exploration methods typically adopt anomalies with uniform physical properties for the forward modeling, which fails to capture the multiscale self-similarity of real geological bodies, and ultimately compromises the accuracy of subsequent inversion interpretations. The Menger sponge is a classic 3-D fractal structure that effectively characterizes the fractal properties of subsurface ore bodies. Therefore, focusing on the characterization of magnetic anomalies in complex fractal structures, this study conducted 3-D forward modeling of magnetic multi-quantities including magnetic anomaly, magnetic three components, and magnetic gradient tensor for Menger sponge magnetic anomaly bodies with different fractal stages. The generalized magnetic potential governing equation was derived based on the fundamental equations of a stable magnetic field, and the discretized format of the governing equation was derived using finite element method(FEM). The method’s validity was verified through comparison with analytical solutions, demonstrating a relative error below 5%. The Menger sponge fractal anomaly bodies with different stages were constructed within 3-D meshs, and the influence of different fractal stages on magnetic anomaly, magnetic three components, and magnetic gradient tensor was analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of magnetic multi-quantities on the recognition of fractal structures was discussed. This study effectively simulates the spatial distribution of magnetic multi-quantities for 3-D fractal structures, which provides a theoretical basis for high-precision inversion of complex geologic bodies, with significant applications in the analysis of ore body structures."

    "abstract": "Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been driving modern advancements in artificial intelligence. With DNNs characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical systems has proven crucial in offering principled analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the first-order expansion, leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer, Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies, game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs), researchers have explored steganography techniques that use DNN models as carriers for secret information hiding. However, existing methods generally suffer from limited imperceptibility and fidelity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a steganography method that achieves high imperceptibility and fidelity while providing substantial embedding capacity and robustness. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch encoder that embeds secret information into the initialization parameters of the cover model with almost no degradation of the model’s functionality. In addition, a new SMSE loss is employed to constrain the encoder output, which enhances the imperceptibility of the stego model. After training and transmission, the receiver can utilize a decoder to accurately extract secret information from the stego model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence more than an order of magnitude lower than existing methods, with values ranging from 0.0003 to 0.007. The stego model preserves high fidelity to the original model, with classification accuracy differences within 0.005 on benchmark datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SST-2. In terms of embedding capacity, it achieves 319,312 bits on ResNet-18 and 1,757,952 bits on ViT, which exceeds the performance of baseline methods across most models. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits strong robustness, as the embedded information can still be accurately recovered with BCH coding even under noise attacks at an SNR as low as -6 dB. It also demonstrates strong generalization, as it performs effectively on both classification networks and generative or reconstruction models such as GANs, VAEs, and U-Nets."

    "abstract": "Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/SunHui1216/SFMFusion."

    "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) that has nearly 273 times more global warming potential than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. By 2030, the Canadian government is requiring Canadian farmers to reduce their synthetic fertilizer-based GHG emissions by one third. Measuring N2O emissions is therefore important, but high frequency sampling requires expensive sensing equipment. Therefore, we propose replacing the expensive equipment with an affordable in-field Internet of Things (IoT) sensing device equipped with intelligence to make reasonably accurate N2O emission predictions by using only proximal sensor data. We gathered N2O emission, weather, and soil sensor data from a smart farm located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, during the 2021, 2022, and 2023 growing seasons. We built a soil sensing microprocessor-based prototype. We performed N2O emission prediction single-year interpolation (or gap-filling) and multi-year extrapolation experiments using data-driven models. Random forest and long short-term memory (LSTM) were the best performing models at interpolating, achieving 0.70–0.90 and 0.71–0.89 R2, respectively. When training models using 2021 data to predict 2022 emissions, reasonable accuracy (up to 0.62 R2) was achieved by the multilayer perceptron model, which was one of the best performing models, alongside LSTM, in these experiments."

    "abstract": "As mobile communication systems have evolved through five generations, we have witnessed an exponential increase in data rates, network capacity, and computational demands—trends that are expected to accelerate with the emergence of 6G. This growth is driven by an explosion in connected devices, vast data volumes, and the increasing need for ultra-high throughput, low latency, and enhanced reliability. Moreover, emerging applications such as virtual reality (VR), autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and e-health are imposing even stricter performance requirements for future wireless networks. Central to the 5G standard is the adoption of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, which equips base stations with a large number of antennas to serve multiple users simultaneously on the same frequencytime resources. While massive MIMO significantly enhances spectral efficiency and network performance, it also introduces significant computational complexity and memory overhead—primarily due to the need to process and store high-dimensional matrices such as channel state information (CSI). Meeting these challenges is becoming increasingly difficult for conventional digital baseband processors, which face limitations from the slowing of Moore's Law, constrained memory bandwidth, and energy-intensive data transfers between memory and compute units. These issues hinder the scalability and efficiency of next-generation 6G systems. This keynote will explore hardware-efficient and low-complexity approaches for implementing baseband signal processing algorithms, focusing on novel computing paradigms that move beyond traditional architectures. In particular, it will highlight the potential of in-memory computing (IMC) as a promising solution to alleviate memory bottlenecks and reduce power consumption. Using practical examples from baseband processing, we will demonstrate how IMC-based architectures can help reshape the future of wireless signal processing and pave the way for realizing the full capabilities of 5G and 6G networks."

    "abstract": "We present the Critical Design Strategy (CDS)—a structured method designed to facilitate the examination of visualisation designs through reflection and critical thought. The CDS helps designers think critically and make informed improvements using heuristic evaluation. When developing a visual tool or pioneering a novel visualisation approach, identifying areas for enhancement can be challenging. Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation designers and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as studying visualisation in higher education. The CDS consists of three stages across six perspectives: Stage 1 captures the essence of the idea by assigning an indicative title and selecting five adjectives (from twenty options) to form initial impressions of the design. Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using 30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives—user, environment, interface, components, design, and visual marks. Stage 3 focuses on synthesising insights, reflecting on design decisions, and determining the next steps forward. We introduce the CDS and explore its use across three visualisation modules in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Our longstanding experience with the CDS has allowed us to refine and develop it over time: from its initial creation through workshops in 2017/18 to improvements in wording and the development of two applications by 2020, followed by the expansion of support notes and refinement of heuristics through 2023; while using it in our teaching each year. This sustained use allows us to reflect on its practical application and offer guidance on how others can incorporate it into their own work."

A human-machine cooperative controller is designed based on the human-machine coupled control. The controller can respond to the driver in real time, and a parallel indirect cooperative control structure is formed with the controller and the driver model. To solve the flexibility of weight allocation for human-machine driving, a weight distributor is designed based on the fuzzy theory considering the fuzzy inputs of the driver, lateral deviation and lateral velocity. The proposed human-machine cooperative method is verified by the CarSim/Simulink platform and on-road tests. The results show that the cooperative controller and weight allocation method can effectively improve the trajectory tracking accuracy, and reduce the driver load and human-machine conflict."

By exploiting the temporal similarity of spike trains across time steps, RST minimizes redundant spike train updates and reduces memory read/write operations. We implement the proposed method on a custom hardware architecture using the TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. Experimental results on the MNIST benchmark demonstrate that RST achieves up to 31% energy savings while maintaining acceptance accuracy, reaching 98.02%, and consuming only <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$22.56 p J$</tex> of Energy per Synaptic OPeration (ESOP).

    "abstract": "The authors investigate heat diffusion in a heterogeneous cavity using the two-dimensional thermal Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), a numerical method well-suited for simulating complex heat transfer problems. The cavity’s heterogeneity is represented by an internal interface characterized by Thermal Contact Resistance (TCR), which accounts for imperfect thermal contact between adjacent surfaces or layers. In order to model this resistance accurately, an extended formulation of the Particle Image model—originally introduced in earlier works—is used. This formulation uses the proportionality of distribution functions across the interface, providing a consistent representation of TCR effects within the LBM framework. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the model along with numerical simulations to validate the proposed configuration. The results reveal the important influence of TCR on the overall heat transfer process, including changes in temperature gaps within the cavity. These findings highlight the importance of accurate modeling of interface resistance in thermal systems with heterogeneous structures."

    "abstract": "The rising structural complexity of modern power systems present significant challenges for the reliable monitoring of insulation conditions in high-voltage electrical equipment. Transient high-frequency pulse signals, such as partial discharges (PDs), are key indicators in circuit anomaly detection. However, their weak amplitude and pronounced non-stationarity severely limit the effectiveness of traditional feature extraction methods. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid PSO-KELM model that couples time–frequency analysis with intelligent optimization. By applying the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the model accurately captures transient characteristics and resonance patterns in high-frequency pulses. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with dynamic weight adjustment is designed to improve the contribution of key high-frequency features. A kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) is constructed for classification by combining nonlinear kernel mapping and regularization to improve the robustness of the classifier in high-noise environments. The simulation performance of the proposed method in a widely used benchmark shows higher accuracy in recognizing PDs signals compared to the conventional method, while maintaining high computational efficiency."

Nevertheless, accurately predicting production could help mitigate this issue by providing better insights and aiding in planning around energy demand, thereby helping to balance consumption with grid supplementation. This work explores the application of time series forecasting methods to predict power production using real-world solar farm data.

In contrast, recent work has demonstrated that smaller, domain-adapted transformer models—such as ModernBERT, RoBERTa-base, and DistilBERT—can be fine-tuned to achieve comparable performance to larger LLMs on well-defined, task-specific objectives.In this study, we evaluate a range of pre-trained transformer models on the task of classifying mathematical problems into pedagogical domains. Our results show that ModernBERT-large, a compact yet specialized model, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.8685—on par with reported performances of much larger LLMs—while being significantly more efficient to train and deploy. These findings suggest that fine-tuning of lightweight models offers a viable and cost-effective alternative to large-scale architectures, especially in educational contexts where scalability, efficiency, and accessibility are essential. This work contributes to the growing evidence that model-task alignment and efficient adaptation strategies can outweigh raw model size in applied NLP tasks."

To investigate the viability of low-resource approaches, the few-shot capabilities of various open-source multilingual large language models (LLMs) are explored for answering questions over transcribed spoken passages, using incontext learning with only a small number of annotated examples. Extensive experiments are conducted on ViSQA, a benchmark dataset developed specifically for Vietnamese Spoken Question Answering.

In the global planning stage, a three-dimensional grid map based on Bayesian filtering is constructed, combined with the pre-calculated shortest path matrix, which effectively improves the search efficiency and can quickly replan the path when encountering dynamic obstacles; in the local planning stage, the third-order B-spline curve is introduced to model and optimize the trajectory, comprehensively considering the smoothness, safety and dynamic feasibility of the trajectory, and completing nonlinear optimization through the Ceres solver and LM algorithm. Experimental results show that this method is superior to the traditional Ego-Planner and Fast-Planner algorithms in terms of computational efficiency, trajectory quality and obstacle avoidance performance. It is suitable for complex power inspection scenarios with less dynamic interference and has good engineering application prospects."

    "abstract": "As distribution networks evolve from decentralized operation toward a flexibly interconnected paradigm, their power flow regulation capability and post-fault reliability have been significantly enhanced. Considering the uncertainties before and after faults, as well as the heterogeneity among regulation resources in terms of capacity, cost, and response speed, this paper proposes a two-stage fault recovery strategy for distribution networks. In the first stage, prior to line outages caused by faults, key resources are pre-deployed, including network reconfiguration, target output scheduling of micro gas turbines, and connection planning of mobile emergency generator(MEG). In the second stage, following the occurrence of a fault, soft open points(SOP) are coordinated over multiple dispatch intervals, along with selective shedding of non-critical loads, to progressively restore critical load supply. A box uncertainty set and an entropy-based uncertainty set are used to respectively characterize the uncertainties in photovoltaic (PV) generation and the occurrence of faulted branches. The problem is then formulated as a two-stage robust optimization model and solved via a column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) method. Case studies based on a modified IEEE 69-bus interconnected system verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "Shifting from conventional low-order interaction (LOI) metrics to high-order interaction (HOI) analyses offers deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we introduce a novel informationtheoretic framework based on O-information to quantify HOI from high-dimensional resting-state EEG data. This approach captures synergistic and redundant patterns among brain regions while remaining computationally tractable. We compare grouplevel LOI and HOI connectivity networks and reveal distinct frequency-specific alterations in MDD, highlighting the complementary dimensions of LOI and HOI brain dynamics. To evaluate their predictive relevance, we propose a dual-network sparse latent space regression model (D-SELSER), which integrates LOI and HOI features through sparsity-regularized projections into shared or independent subspaces. Applied to four clinical symptom scales, HOI-based models consistently outperform LOI-based baselines. Notably, the D-SELSER achieves the lowest overall prediction errors, with learned weight matrices which reveal a stronger contribution from HOI-derived connections in individualized prediction. These findings underscore the importance of modeling high-order dependencies in functional brain networks and provide a novel, interpretable framework for personalized prediction in MDD."

To tailor these features effectively, user motivations are analyzed through Bartle's taxonomy, classifying participants into four personas: achievers, killers, socializers, and explorers. A prototype incorporating key gamification elements—such as points, badges, levels, and leaderboards—is particularly evaluated involving 119 participants through the System Usability Scale (SUS) for rapid usability assessments, detailed Usability Testing across specific tasks, and the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), measuring attractiveness, clarity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty.

    "abstract": "Food ingredient recognition has gathered significant public interest, as this technology addresses various challenges related to the automatic identification of food ingredients, including calorie detection for dietary applications. An unbalanced label distribution in the dataset will pose present challenges during the modeling process, leading to model biased towards one of the labels. Typically, conventional approaches to address the issue of imbalanced datasets involve either modifying the dataset or training parameters. However, these methods can introduce complexity during modeling process. This study aims to bridge this gap by implementing an appropriate model without transforming datasets or training parameters. Especially, the research evaluates and compares the performance of three variants of the YOLO model: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLO-World. The YOLO-World model is particularly remarkable as it embraces Open Vocabulary Detection (OVD) within its architecture, allowing the model to apply not only visual information but also language information to enhance object detection capabilities. The evaluation was conducted using a food ingredient image dataset which has an unbalanced class distribution, where certain classes has significantly more data than others. To ensure fair evaluation, each model was trained and tested under equivalent conditions. The models evaluated included YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11m, and YOLOv8mWorldv2. The evaluation focused on measuring model performance in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The findings indicate that OVD models, such as YOLO-World, provide superior accuracy; however, they may not be suitable for deployment on devices with limited specifications. Conversely, YOLOv8n offers a lightweight computational process during both training and prediction, rendering it appropriate for use on devices with constrained capabilities."

However, these two processes remain separate, limiting the target information available during recognition and thus hindering further improvements in recognition accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a complex-valued end-to-end integrated network for enhanced imaging and recognition, termed CVEIR-Net. In CVEIR-Net, the complex-valued enhanced imaging module employs a complex-valued encoder to extract the hierarchical scattering features from complex echoes and a complex-valued decoder to reconstruct imaging results with enhanced weak scattering features. The complex-valued enhanced recognition module first adjusts unknown deformations in enhanced ISAR imaging results through spatial transformation and then extracts multiscale complex-valued features using stacked complex convolutional layers, enabling end-to-end high-precision target recognition. Experimental results on the space target dataset demonstrate that the proposed CVEIR-Net achieves higher recognition accuracy, indicating that integrating imaging and recognition into a unified network significantly improves space target recognition performance."

Despite extensive research conducted by numerous elevator manufacturers and scholars on elevator safety, existing monitoring systems still exhibit notable limitations, including limited versatility, escalated hardware costs arising from the inclusion of additional sensors, and an increase in fault nodes. Among various elevator malfunctions, bottoming and overrun faults are of particular criticality due to their high-risk nature and potential to induce catastrophic equipment damage and passenger injuries.Against this background, this study presents a novel elevator monitoring system. A data collector is developed to extract raw CAN bus data from elevators, which undergoes preprocessing and is transmitted via wireless communication to a private cloud platform. Additionally, fault detection algorithms for bottoming and overrun faults are designed to enable elevator fault alerting and other application requirements.

Conventional filtering methods in HVDC systems primarily focus on reducing Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) in voltage waveforms, frequently employing cascaded or parallel filter units that increase system complexity and costs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a Double-Resistor Damped Double-Tuned Passive Power Filter (DR-DDTF) Filter at the AC sides of Line Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDC systems, a pioneering design integrated with a novel Arctic Puffin Optimization (APO) technique, uniquely engineered to suppress THD in both voltage and current harmonics simultaneously. Unlike previous techniques, the suggested filter uses a simple configuration with only two filters per converter. The research also examines several filtering techniques and the new DR-DDTF for the AC sides of Line Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDC systems. Simulations were performed using the LCC HVDC system to illustrate the DR-DDTF Filter’s superiority, decreasing voltage and current THD, and outperforming traditional filters. The filter’s adaptive tuning capabilities, enabled by APO, assure reliable performance."

    "abstract": "Individuals with hearing impairments who use Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) often face communication barriers in daily life due to societal unfamiliarity with sign language, limiting their social and professional integration. This paper introduces a high-accuracy ArSL recognition system leveraging MediaPipe for feature extraction and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification. To improve performance and reduce computational complexity, only the most relevant features were collected. By capturing only 21 hand landmark coordinates via MediaPipe, a personally collected dataset of 7,010 samples covering 31 Arabic signs was created. New geometric features (means, angles and distances) have been created to improve spatial understanding using feature engineering techniques, which produce new, more informative features and capture better geometric relationships between hand landmarks. The proposed DNN model achieved a test accuracy of 99.71%, demonstrating near-perfect recognition capability. These results validate the effectiveness of combining MediaPipe for efficient feature extraction with DNN modeling and strategic engineered feature. Furthermore, the proposed research advances accessible communication tools for Hearing-impaired Arabic individuals and provides a scalable methodology applicable to other sign languages."

    "abstract": "Personalized depression treatment, despite decades of research, is still elusive. The current best practice is closely monitoring patients and adjusting the treatment as needed. Close monitoring of patients is, however, challenging in clinical settings due to high cost, limited resources, and patient burden. In this paper, we explore using daily step counts automatically collected by a fitness wristband for depression treatment status monitoring. We focus on deep learning models that can effectively learn feature representation from a sequence of raw daily step count data, without relying on handcrafted features. One significant challenge is that our dataset is small, while deep learning models typically need large amounts of data to achieve strong generalization. To address this challenge, we investigate self-supervised contrastive pretraining to learn feature representation, followed by utilizing these representations for binary classification. Our results show that this contrastive pretraining approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models. When using step count data together with a one-shot self-reported baseline questionnaire score, it leads to validation F1 score up to 0.74, comparable to the best F1 score (0.72) when using baseline and burdensome periodic self-reported scores. Last, when further including daily sleep data, the best F1 score is improved to 0.77."

    "abstract": "Recently, ViTAE-RVSA, the first large-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) tailored for remote sensing, has demonstrated the potential of ViTs by integrating window attention with a convolutional branch. However, as this branch still adopts isotropic square kernels and conventional Feature Pyramid Networks neglect directional priors in multi-scale fusion, the resulting representations remain suboptimal for arbitrarily oriented, high-aspect-ratio, and small objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose Strip-ViTAE, a transformer-based detector that embeds a rotation-equivariant convolution (R2Conv) in the backbone to capture orientation-consistent local features. Moreover, we introduce a Parallel Strip Convolution Module (PSCM) employing horizontal and vertical strip kernels to adaptively enlarge the receptive field and strengthen local feature modeling for elongated and small objects. Finally, we design a Strip Feature Pyramid Network (StripFPN) composed of a Bottom-Up Reflow Module (Bottom-Up RM), a Strip-Based Enhancement Module (SBEM), and a Self-Attention Excitation Module (SAEM) to achieve direction-consistent cross-scale fusion. Experiments on the DOTA-v1.5 dataset show that Strip-ViTAE attains 72.82% mAP, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.35% and improving the mAP for high-aspect-ratio and small objects by 3.20%, validating the effectiveness of our method."

First, to circumvent obstacles between the light source (LS) and legal receivers, we utilize a transmission relay (TR) to forward information signals from the LS to the receiver plane. Subsequently, to ensure communication security, we select a jamming relay to enlarge the channel capacity gap between eavesdroppers and legal receivers through cooperative jamming. Using stochastic geometry, we derive closed-form expressions for key performance metrics, including the cumulative distribution function of secrecy capacity, security outage probability, and their lower and upper bounds, both with and without relay cooperation. To further enhance system security, we introduce a disk-shaped security-protected zone around the TR. All analytical expressions are numerically verified through Monte Carlo simulations, serving as benchmarks to evaluate security performance. Numerical results confirm that our proposed scheme can ensure continuous signal reception and high-level security. Furthermore, while relay cooperation modestly enhances system security, the introduction of a security-protected zone around the TR yields substantial security improvement, which offers practical insights for designing secure time-division-multiple-access-based MuVLC where communication links are obstructed."

Multi-source remote sensing data provides abundant temporal, spatial, and spectral information for tree species classification. However, there lacks tree species classification methods which comprehensively capture and fuse spatio-temporal-spectral information. Therefore, a tree species classification method based on deep ensemble learning of multi-source spatio-temporal-spectral remote sensing data is proposed. Firstly, multi-temporal, high-resolution and hyperspectral data are utilized for training temporal, spatial, and spectral deep networks. Furtherly, deep ensemble learning is developed for fusion of spatio-temporal-spectral network outputs, where weighted fusion is implemented via dynamic weight optimization based on the spatio-temporal-spatial features. Experimental results indicate that the importance of temporal features is higher than that of spatial information, and spectral networks perform best among all network structures. After the spatio-temporal-spectral ensemble learning, the performance of tree species classification is further improved, and the overall accuracy of the proposed method reaches above 90%. The proposed algorithm realizes precise and fine-scale tree species classification, and provides technique support for the monitoring and conservation of forest resource."

This classification critically impacts perceived valuation reliability, yet remains inconsistent when performed manually. We propose a novel hybrid architecture combining transformer-based attention with graph neural networks (GNNs) that jointly exploits temporal market patterns and inter-instrument relational dependencies. Our approach leverages transformer encoders to capture time-series dynamics in market data while utilizing graph neural networks to model structural relationships between instruments. To address limited labeled data availability, we implement self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled market data, enhancing model efficiency. The architecture’s attention mechanisms provide interpretable explanations crucial for audit and regulatory compliance. Experiments on open-source datasets of derivatives and structured products demonstrate that our model achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods including rule-based classifiers (73%) and XGBoost (80%). Notably, our model excels at identifying Level 3 instruments (F1-score 0.90) while maintaining interpretability through attention-based explanations that highlight key temporal periods and influential instrument relationships. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of both transformer and GNN components. This work bridges advanced deep learning with financial compliance requirements, facilitating more consistent, accurate, and transparent valuation procedures that align with regulatory standards."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized and tamper-resistant nature, offers strong auditing guarantees across a wide range of applications. However, its inherent immutability presents challenges when correcting erroneous transactions or removing sensitive information is necessary. To address this, the concept of redactable blockchain has emerged, aiming to improve adaptability to real-world regulatory and operational needs. Yet, existing designs often suffer from limitations in decentralization, security, or efficiency. This paper introduces an Enhanced Threshold Chameleon Hash (ETCH) scheme as a foundational building block for redactable blockchains. ETCH enables redactions only when a predefined threshold of nodes collaborates to generate trapdoor shares, preserving decentralization. It also enhances collision resistance, overcoming key security flaws in prior schemes, and incorporates a periodic trapdoor refresh mechanism to improve long-term robustness. Experimental results show that ETCH reduces computational overhead by 50% in Hash and Verify phases and by 22.26% in the Adapt phase. The prototype implementation of the ETCH-based redactable blockchain further confirms ETCH's effectiveness in supporting low-latency redactions and mitigating blockchain state growth. Overall, ETCH improves both the security and efficiency of redactable blockchains, broadening their applicability in privacy-sensitive and regulated scenarios."

    "abstract": "Neutron studies are of significant interest in fields such as radiation protection, nuclear reactor physics, and criticality safety, where accurate determination of the neutron field is essential. Determining the neutron field typically involves unfolding the detector signals, such as those obtained from the Activation and Counting Neutron Spectrometer (SNAC) detector. Traditional methods, as Bayesian approaches, have been widely integrated for the neutron spectrum unfolding. However, these methods rely on an initial solution estimation, introducing biases or uncertainties. Recent studies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have demonstrated its potential to address challenges as hysteresis regression. This work is based on our novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to overcome the hysteresis problem in neutron spectrum unfolding. The CNN model predicts the neutron spectrum directly from detector counts, eliminating the need for prior solution predictions. The proposed architecture was trained on a large simulation dataset and validated through a combination of Serpent simulations of various Californium-252 (Cf) spectra and Monte Carlo N-Particles (MCNP) simulations of the Silene reactor. These two complementary simulation approaches are used to evaluate the CNN’s evaluation in realistic neutron environments. The results demonstrate the model’s high efficiency and accuracy, as evidenced by key performance metrics and the quality of the predicted spectrum (SQ). This approach represents a significant step forward in optimizing and validating AI-based methods for neutron field, especially in criticality dosimetry and radiation protection applications. Preliminary comparisons with Bayesian unfolding codes already indicate than CNN based predictions can capture fine spectral features. A benchmark against MAXED, GRAVEL and Nubay remains a key perspective, together with validation campaigns on neutron facilities."

Traditional methods for style classification often depend on manually designed descriptors or basic segmentation techniques, which are constrained by limited semantic representation, poor generalization across diverse packaging motifs, and low classification accuracy. To address these challenges, this research proposes a method that extracts multi-level visual features—including color, texture, shape, and structural layout—from packaging images using a deep neural network architecture that combines convolutional layers with attention modules and semantic segmentation. The extracted feature vectors are utilized in a classification pipeline to categorize packaging designs into stylistic groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a style classification accuracy improvement of over 4% and exhibits enhanced clustering coherence, indicating clearer separation between stylistic categories. Furthermore, model optimization techniques reduce inference time by approximately 20%, enhancing computational efficiency. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the integrated feature extraction and classification framework, contributing to the fields of computational aesthetics and multimedia vision by advancing methodologies in visual feature extraction, semantic segmentation, and style analysis."

However, materials covering the receiving antenna influence the accuracy of experimental data. To address this, we utilize a finite-length dielectric cylinder as the antenna model and transform the receiving antenna problem into a target scattering problem. A theoretical method is developed for studying the scattering properties of a finite-length dielectric cylinder in the anisotropic ionosphere. Our analysis outlines the surface current and scattered pattern in terms of the ordinary wave (O-wave) and extra-ordinary wave (E-wave) using the integral equation (IE) approach and the method of moment (MoM). Numerical results demonstrate that the current distribution is sensitive to the structure’s dimensions (radius and length of cylinders), incident angles, and material characteristics. The surface current of a dielectric cylinder is composed of electric and magnetic currents, with electric current playing the main role. Furthermore, the variations in current amplitude and phase as functions of operating frequency are also studied. The current envelope undergoes slight modifications as the frequency varies. For a given geometry, it becomes more pronounced and shifts towards higher frequencies. Moreover, it is noted that an increment in the scattering angles will lead to a rise in the scattered pattern. Compared with the model analyzed using COMSOL based on the finite element method (FEM) and series method, the results show that the scattered fields against the IE method are in good agreement with those obtained from FEM. Meanwhile, the IE method indicates a low relative error of 3% compared to FEM."

The framework systematically evaluates various fusion strategies, including concatenation, self-attention, cross-attention, and a hybrid attention mechanism, all within a unified architecture and dataset. Extensive experiments on the SmartBugs benchmark demonstrate two key findings: (1) the pairing of CodeBERT(SBT) and gMLP(opcode) achieves superior modality synergy (F1-score: 0.84), and (2) our hybrid attention fusion mechanism further improves performance to 0.87 F1, outperforming other fusion strategies by up to 3.6%.

This paper presents an enhanced approach for ECG signal classification using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce several improvements to conventional CNN architectures, including statistical resampling, targeted data augmentation, residual connections, and attention mechanisms to address the significant class imbalance present in ECG datasets.

Our experimental results, including a comprehensive ablation study, demonstrate that each component of our architecture contributes to the overall performance, with data augmentation and class weighting having the most significant impact. The enhanced model shows particular strength in handling the severe class imbalance (82.8% Normal beats) common in real-world ECG datasets, making it suitable for clinical applications.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid growth of demand in medical rehabilitation and human-machine interaction, BrainComputer Interface (BCI) technology has become increasingly important. In the field of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recognition, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become a research focus due to their strong feature extraction capabilities. However, current EEG signal processing methods, often constrained by CPU-based computing due to memory access limitations, struggle with high computational complexity and insufficient real-time performance. These limitations hinder the development of portable and low-power BCI systems for future applications. To address these issues, this study focuses on EEGNet, a lightweight CNN model, and proposes a hardware-software collaborative optimization strategy. We designed a configurable hardware acceleration framework to improve efficiency. Experimental results on the BCI Competition IV Dataset using an FPGA platform show that the proposed method achieves millisecond-level real-time inference while maintaining low resource usage. Compared to software implementation solutions, it reduces power consumption by $\\mathbf{9 2. 4 \\%}$ and delivers an $\\mathbf{8. 2}$ times speedup with only a $0.9 \\%$ accuracy drop. This work demonstrates notable strengths in three aspects: accuracy preservation, inference efficiency, and power consumption characteristics, thus providing an efficient solution for the hardware deployment of BCI systems."

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a vital role in human-computer interaction, social robotics, and mental health monitoring. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework for FER that combines ResNet121 for deep feature extraction and LightGBM for efficient classification. Traditional FER methods often suffer from low accuracy and poor generalization due to manual feature engineering and limited learning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid architecture that leverages the power of deep convolutional networks and gradient boosting. Our method first employs ResNet121 to extract high-level discriminative features from facial images, followed by a LightGBM classifier optimized with weight normalization to enhance classification performance. Experiments conducted on the FER13 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy (99.19%), recall (98%), F1 score (98%), and precision (98%) compared to existing methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in capturing complex emotional expressions and its potential for real-time applications. Future work will explore the integration of multimodal data and advanced architectures like Transformers to further improve robustness and generalization."

    "abstract": "In order to improve the safety, repeatability, and standardization of the execution of assisted driving vehicle test scenarios, this paper proposes the use of remote driving cooperative control for interference target vehicles to effectively reproduce standard interference test dynamic scenarios and examine the performance of assisted driving vehicles. The jamming target vehicle achieves low-latency remote transmission of inertial guidance information, vehicle information, and control instructions with the help of a Local Area Network (LAN), a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server, and Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol conversion equipment. The terminal computing center deploys cloud servers to receive vehicle feedback information for lateral and longitudinal control models, planning vehicle trajectories, desired speeds, and accelerations, etc. The lower controller, composed of lateral LQR and longitudinal dual PID, sends control commands and remotely transmits them to the jamming target vehicle, realizing closed-loop data. By designing simulation condition experiments and Real-time Software-in-the-Loop (RT-SIL) experiments to study the communication link delay throughout the entire process and the control effect of the control algorithm under this delay, the results show that the vehicle has a good trajectory tracking control effect in both straight-line acceleration and deceleration conditions and lane change conditions. Its speed tracking effect, longitudinal error, lateral error, and heading angle error achieve ideal results."

    "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable fault diagnosis for robotic joint transmission systems remains a key bottleneck in achieving reliable industrial automation. These systems often degrade through complex time-varying dynamics—such as stiffness loss and damping fluctuations—that challenge conventional black-box models, especially when signal noise and structural ambiguity are involved. To overcome this, we propose an inverse Physics-Constrained Learning (iPCL) framework that infers latent mechanical parameters from vibration signals using a simplified dynamic model. A residual physics constraint is introduced to align estimated responses with system dynamics, offering physically consistent supervision without relying on hard-to-measure forces. In parallel, motor current signals are leveraged as auxiliary inputs to enhance class separability, decoupled from the physics pathway to preserve interpretability. The fused representation significantly improves both classification accuracy and physical insight. Experimental results on real-world joint datasets demonstrate that iPCL consistently outperforms traditional signal-driven and deep learning baselines. This work establishes a scalable and physically grounded diagnostic paradigm for intelligent health monitoring in industrial robotic transmissions."

To investigate the impacts of these different transmission modes on renewable energy accommodation, this study establishes a renewable energy accommodation model that incorporates both medium-to-long term transmission trading and cross-regional spot trading of renewable energy. Using this model, we analyze the effects of different trading modes on key indicators such as renewable energy curtailment rate, the proportion of renewable energy generation in total electricity output, and DC transmission utilization hours. Based on actual data from a northwestern province in China, the DC transmission scheduling is optimized for this province, effectively reducing the renewable energy curtailment rate while ensuring the required DC transmission utilization hours."

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a popular loyalty metric, yet it often falls short in reflecting actual customer behavior, particularly when high NPS scores do not translate into repeat purchases or sales growth. This study introduces a machine learning-based approach to enhance NPS evaluation by integrating it with customer behavior metrics using the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) framework. A dataset comprising NPS and transaction records was preprocessed and analyzed using the Random Forest algorithm. The integration of NPS and RFM enabled the identification of customer segments that conventional NPS analysis might overlook, such as high-scoring but lowcontributing customers. The findings reveal that combining behavioral insights with loyalty metrics leads to more accurate customer profiling and actionable strategies for retention. This model supports data-driven decision-making and provides B2B firms with a more reliable method to align loyalty indicators with financial outcomes."

The traditional analytical model only accounts for skin and proximity effects, which neglect the influences of the rotor iron core, air gap and permanent magnet flux-linkage. To address this problem, this paper proposes an improved analytical model by introducing an air-gap correction coefficient and an additional loss model for PM flux-linkage. This method achieves full-operating-range prediction of the winding AC losses. The finite element validation confirms that this model maintains low errors in AC loss calculation of all speed ranges. Significantly, at high speeds, the error remains below 2%, which achieves a great improvement over conventional analytical models. This approach provides a reliable tool for calculations of high-frequency AC losses in the hairpin winding motors of new energy vehicles."

This study introduces Relative Chromatic Quinary Code, namely Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (RCQ-c-VEP), utilizing red/green and blue/yellow relative chromatic contrast mechanisms, with gray serving as the neutral reference. We investigated color modulation effects on cVEP neural responses and evaluate RCQ-c-VEP against grayscale-modulated c-VEP (Gray-c-VEP) in terms of accuracy and user-friendliness under 60 Hz and 120 Hz refresh rates. RCQ-c-VEP significantly outperformed Gray-c-VEP in accuracy at both refresh rates. In 120 Hz mode, its average accuracy was 96.22% ($\\mathbf{4. 6 7 \\%}$ higher, $\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{0. 0 2 0}$). User-friendliness was also optimal: 93.3% comfort, median ratings of 4 for flicker intensity and visual comfort. Moreover, the 120 Hz mode halved single-trial duration, substantially accelerating Visual fatigue experimental speed compared to 60 Hz. The findings demonstrate that RCQ-c-VEP significantly surpasses Gray-c-VEP in accuracy and userfriendliness. Under a 120 Hz refresh rate, RCQ-c-VEP provides a solution that effectively balances speed, accuracy, and user experience."

In this paper, we propose a novel attention-guided fusion framework designed two-stage attention mechanism. First, an attention-based fusion is performed between the aspect embeddings and the text embeddings to generate aspect-aware textual representations. These enriched textual features are then fused with visual embeddings using a secondary attention layer, enabling cross-modal interactions that are critical for sentiment interpretation. We evaluate our model on the MASAD multimodal benchmark dataset, where it consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines across multiple categories.

Prompt detection of this pest, as well as its eggs, allows growers to apply effective control strategies Yet, existing small object detectors often struggle to accurately detect such pests due to their small size, resulting in incomplete detection outcomes. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a robust method for effectively detecting this pest, termed YOLO-Pest. In our method, a feature reinforcement (FR) module is developed to improve feature maps that are used for prediction. Besides, an extra prediction layer is added to boost the detection performance of small pests. Experimental results on a collected dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance, attaining a detection accuracy of 76.69 % and outperforming existing lightweight object detection models."

    "abstract": "The reliance on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Network (SDN) introduces a wide variety of security risks in Service Function Chain (SFC), necessitating the implementation of automated security measures to safeguard ongoing service delivery. To address the security risks faced by online SFCs and the shortcomings of traditional manual configuration, we introduce Intent-Based Networking (IBN) for the first time to propose an automatic security enhancement method through embedding Network Security Functions (NSFs). However, the diverse security requirements and performance requirements of SFCs pose significant challenges to the translation from intents to NSF embedding schemes, which manifest in two main aspects. In the logical orchestration stage, NSF composition consisting of NSF sets and their logical embedding locations will significantly impact the security effect. So security intent language model, a formalized method, is proposed to express the security intents. Additionally, NSF Embedding Model Generation Algorithm (EMGA) is designed to determine NSF composition by utilizing NSF capability label model and NSF collaboration model, where NSF composition can be further formulated as NSF embedding model. In the physical embedding stage, the differentiated service requirements among SFCs result in NSF embedded model obtained by EMGA being a multi-objective optimization problem with variable objectives. Therefore, Adaptive Security-aware Embedding Algorithm (ASEA) featuring adaptive link weight mapping mechanism is proposed to solve the optimal NSF embedding schemes. This enables the automatic translation of security intents into NSF embedding schemes, ensuring that both security requirements are met and service performance is guaranteed. We develop the system instance to verify the feasibility of intent translation solution, and massive evaluations demonstrate that ASEA algorithm has better performance compared with the existing works in the diverse requirement scenarios."

    "abstract": "Driven by the increasing demand for intelligent earth observation and large-scale scene understanding, remote sensing object detection has gained significant academic and practical importance. Despite notable progress in feature extraction and computational efficiency, many recent approaches still struggle to effectively handle issues such as detecting objects at multiple scales and preserving small targets. In this paper, an efficient remote sensing object detector called multi-scale and feature-preserving YOLO with gated attention (YOLO-MFG) is proposed to address these challenges. First, a multi-scale group shuffle attention (MGSA) module is introduced to adaptively aggregate multi-scale spatial features, improving the model’s sensitivity to objects of diverse sizes. Second, the employment of feature-preserving downsampling (FPD) enhances the downsampling process by introducing a triple-branch fusion mechanism that mitigates aliasing while jointly preserving semantics, saliency, and geometry. Finally, gated enhanced attention (GEA) is integrated to capture long-range dependencies and contextual cues crucial for remote sensing scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLO-MFG achieves a 2.9% improvement in mean average precision at an IoU threshold of 0.5 (mAP50) on the optical remote sensing dataset SIMD compared to YOLO11. In addition, the mAP50 of detection results is improved by 1.4% and 4.2% on the DIOR and NWPU VHR-10 datasets, respectively."

However, complex network architectures and high computational costs conflict with the resource limitations of small edge devices. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we propose a multi-level variance feature modulation network (MVFMNet), which can effectively utilize both local and non-local information for better super-resolution reconstruction of remote sensing images. Specifically, we propose a local variance-aware spatial attention (LVSA) module, which employs adaptive max-pooling to extract non-local features and introduces local variance to represent local structure. Building upon LVSA, we design a multi-level variance feature modulation block (MVFMB) by integrating two LVSA branches with distinct downsampling scales, enabling adaptive selection of multi-scale representative features. To further enhance the features modulated by MVFMB, we introduce a symmetric gated feed-forward network to fuse more local contextual information. Comparison experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that MVFMNet can achieve a better trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency in remote sensing image super-resolution. The code of MVFMNet will be released at https://github.com/AHUT-MILAGroup/MVFMNet."

In this paper, a near field wideband terahertz XL-MIMO ISAC system is investigated, where the dual-functional base station communicates with a user and detects a non-cooperative target simultaneously. Our objective is to maximize the achievable rate within the constraints of sensing coverage and resolution in both angular and distance domains by designing the delays and phase shifts for the three-dimensional (3D) delay-phase beamforming framework. Firstly, the phase shifts are derived based on the controllable 3D beam squint method. Then, the mathematical relationship between the delays introduced by the true-time-delays (TTDs) and the constraints of sensing coverage and resolution in both angular and distance domains is derived based on the analysis for controllable 3D beam squint effect, based on which the optimization problem is reconstructed. Finally, the optimal delays introduced by the TTDs are derived, facilitating the trade-off between the achievable rate and sensing coverage with adequate sensing resolution. The proposed method can degenerate to the far field case. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate the performance trade-off between the achievable rate and sensing coverage with sufficient sensing resolution."

Traditional monitoring methods often fail to detect early-stage wear in time.

In this study, a new spiral-wound probe electrostatic sensor was designed, and a 3D model of the sensor was constructed to clarify its overall structural design. Since conducting single wear particle charge induction experiments in real environments is challenging, finite element simulations of the spiral-shaped probe were performed using COMSOL software to thoroughly investigate its sensing characteristics. The study analyzed the sensor’s response to various structural parameters, wear particle shapes, and lubricating oil quality. Results showed that increasing the number of turns and the width of the spiral sheet, while reducing the thickness and inner diameter of the insulating tube, enhanced the sensor’s sensitivity. In contrast, the thickness of the probe and the shielding layer had minimal impact on sensing performance. Overall, the electrostatic sensor effectively distinguished different wear types and assessed the quality of lubricating oil."

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a crucial field in safety monitoring technologies, particularly in efforts to minimize the risk of accidents such as fall detection. However, previous studies often underutilize the combination of spatial and temporal information from multi-domain radar data, limiting classification performance in dynamic scenarios. This study aims to classify human activities using 3D point cloud data generated by the FMCW radar IWR6843AOPEVM. The data is transformed into 2D tensors by stacking multiple feature representations, Doppler vs Range, Doppler vs Time, and Range vs Time, to capture rich spatial-temporal characteristics across domains. A key contribution of this work is the integration of multi-domain features through a stacking method and the evaluation of an optimal windowing strategy that balances temporal resolution with computational efficiency for real-time HAR systems. This research also evaluates the optimal windowing strategy by considering both human motion duration and radar configuration. A 2D Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) is employed as the classification model, with hyperparameter tuning performed using Keras Tuner. Experimental results indicate that larger window sizes lead to higher classification accuracy. However, increasing the window size also introduces greater computational load, particularly for real-time systems. Based on the findings, a sliding window of 30 frames with stride 1 yields the highest accuracy of 99.8 % and is considered the best compromise between classification performance and computational efficiency for real-time implementation."

Utilizing the variable density method and a Brinkman porous media model, coupled with fluid dynamics and heat transfer equations, a multi-objective optimization function is established to minimize both the average temperature and pressure drop. The relative importance of these objectives is balanced by a weighting factor w. Simulations using COMSOL software analyzed four inlet/outlet configurations (diagonal, same-side, single-inlet, dual-inlet) under constraints of Reynolds number 100 and fluid volume fraction 0.5, investigating flow channel evolution patterns and temperature distribution characteristics. The research results show:The weighting factor significantly impacts channel structure—low values (w<0.5) reduce flow resistance but create localized \"stagnant fluid lakes,\" causing temperature non-uniformity; high values (w>0.7) enhance heat transfer via dense branched channels but increase pressure drop by up to 130%, recommending an engineering range of w=0.7-0.9; The dual-inlet configuration with w>0.7 forms a symmetric \"figure-eight\" channel network, reducing the maximum temperature difference by 38% and improving temperature uniformity by over 60% compared to the single-inlet design; The diagonal outlet layout provides superior temperature uniformity over the same-side layout. The optimized dual-inlet solution (w=0.7) achieves an average temperature of 306.69K and a pressure drop of 0.49Pa, offering an efficient design paradigm for cooling high-power-density electronic devices."

Specifically, a multi-scale cascaded Morlet wavelet filter bank is designed in the frequency domain to effectively extract key frequency features from bearing vibration signals based on physical priors. A channel attention mechanism is further introduced to adaptively weight and fuse multi-channel signals, dynamically emphasizing the relative importance of each channel and enhancing interpretability during signal processing. Moreover, the model employs statistical features with clear physical significance for quantitative analysis, ensuring the physical traceability of the extracted features.

In addition, distribution imbalance further aggravates the problem of negative transfer. To address these issues, a Multi-Source Contrastive Learning model with Pseudo-Label Self-Correction and Weight Adaptation (MSCL-PLWA) is proposed. Synthetic data are first generated using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). Contrastive learning is then employed to train the model by evaluating the similarity between augmented instances and minimizing the distance between similar pairs of synthetic and real samples. A prototype-based pseudo-labeling algorithm is subsequently applied for pseudo-label self-correction, and a multi-pseudo-label-guided Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (LMMD) strategy is incorporated to enhance subdomain alignment. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism is introduced to assign higher weights to source domains more relevant to the target domain, thereby reducing the adverse impact of less relevant domains and mitigating negative transfer. Experimental results on two bearing platforms demonstrate that MSCL-PLWA effectively suppresses negative transfer and exhibits strong cross-domain fault diagnosis performance."

    "abstract": "Rotating machinery equipment exhibits diverse failure modes under prolonged operating conditions, posing significant challenges for fault diagnosis. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated notable success in addressing complex fault problems, their edge weight calculations often rely on a single metric function, limiting their ability to capture multi-physics coupling characteristics. Consequently, computing appropriate edge weights has garnered increasing attention. Fusing multiple metric functions for edge weight calculation enables the capture of multi-dimensional relationships between nodes and enhances the robustness of the weighting process. Furthermore, incorporating a dynamic computation mechanism based on node features allows for adaptive edge weight updates, thereby improving the model's expressiveness and adaptability. This paper proposes a GNN-based fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery that dynamically updates edge weights through metric function fusion (DMF-GNN). First, datasets are constructed using vibration signals collected from rotating machinery. During the creation of input samples for the GNN, edge weights are dynamically computed and updated by fusing multiple metric functions and introducing a node-feature-based dynamic mechanism. Subsequently, propose the Multi-Layer Perceptron Enhanced Edge Aggregated Graph Attention Networks (ME-EGAT) method. EGAT integrated with (MLP) modules is employed for deep feature extraction, ultimately classifying the operational states of the rotating machinery. Finally, the proposed method is empirically validated on the Paderborn University bearing dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively implements dynamic edge weight updates based on metric function fusion within a GNN framework, leading to enhanced diagnostic performance. It provides an efficient solution integrating multi-source information with stronger adaptability for diagnosing complex faults characterized by difficult-to-capture multi-physics coupling effects."

Specifically, based on the standard ordering at a stochastic time, 1) a defect-induced standard ordering is placed at defect identification without stochastic ordering before, 2) a failure-induced emergent ordering is placed at sudden failure without the extra ordering before, 3) a threshold controls whether another emergent ordering is needed when the spare has been standardly ordered but unreached at failure time. Furthermore, the postponed and immediate replacement activities are integrated referring to the states of spare and system operation. The cost-efficiency captured by long-term operational cost rate is established and optimized.

Pretrained on a large dataset of $\\mathbf{3 2, 1 2 0}$ annotated lesion patches, our model learns powerful representations that are then refined for prediction tasks via an attention-based multiple-instance learning strategy.

The optimization results show that, compared to a scheme considering only high-power pulse discharge, the proposed configuration achieves a mass reduction of 5.5% at -40°C and 7.3% at -30°C. Simulation results at -30°C further demonstrate that the optimized configuration maintains excellent voltage stability and confirm the effectiveness of the energy management strategy."

We propose MASD (Multi-scale Artifact-aware Self-supervised Deepfake detector), combining multi-scale SSL with handcrafted features. MASD decomposes spectrograms into three frequency bands, processed through an encoder pretrained using masked reconstruction, contrastive predictive coding, and adversarial vocoder classification. Features fuse with phase coherence, spectral flux, and high-frequency energy through cross-attention, classified by temperature-scaled SVM. Evaluation on ASVspoof 2019 LA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm adversarial augmentation as the primary driver of robustness, improving EER from 1.52% to 0.39%, while zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation validates generalization effectiveness, establishing MASD as a practical solution."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a Class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with low-phase-noise (PN) and ultra-low-power consumption is proposed by reactivating the common-mode (CM) coupling factor in a 1:2 transformer. Unlike conventional designs that exclusively consider the differential-mode (DM) coupling factor in 1:2 transformers, our proposed architecture effectively leverages the combined potential of DM and CM coupling factors in a single transformer. For DM operation, a novel design method is presented to efficiently guide the design of ultra-low-power VCOs. This method provides clear insights into how Class-F<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub> resonator parameters influence the loop gain characteristics, establishing a quantitative framework for performance optimization. Regarding CM operation, the 1:2 transformer’s coupling mechanism is analyzed in detail for the first time. The analysis reveals that strategic layout optimization of the center tap can reactivate the CM coupling factor, effectively expanding the CM resonance to reduce PN. Furthermore, by incorporating a tightly coupled tertiary coil, a local oscillator signal with high spectral purity is realized. Fabricated in a 110-nm CMOS process, the proposed VCO achieves a 20.2% frequency tuning range (FTR) from 10.45 to 12.80 GHz, consuming 0.38-0.50 mW with 0.2-V power supply. The measured PN exhibits −107 and −130 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz and 10 MHz offset from a 12.80-GHz carrier, respectively, with corresponding excellent figures-of-merit (FoM) of 192 and 195 dBc/Hz, respectively."

In this paper, the resistance degradation of unintentionally doped single crystal BaTiO3 capacitors has been studied as a function of electric field, temperature, and capacitor size. The experimental data show the degradation behavior of single crystal BaTiO3 depends strongly on the electric field strength. The activation energy for degradation in BaTiO3 capacitors shows a sudden change around the Curie temperature which indicates that the conductivity mechanism above the Curie temperature is different than at low temperature. We observed that unintentionally doped single crystal BaTiO3 capacitors exhibit three distinct stages of degradation, suggesting the presence of multiple conduction mechanisms during the degradation process."

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology for enhancing communication performance over conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) by exploiting spatial channel variations. In this paper, we propose a general energy efficiency (EE) optimization framework for the MA-aided multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink communications. We jointly optimize the precoding matrices and the positions of transmit and receive MAs considering two different types of power constraint models, i.e., the sum power constraint (SPC) and multiple weighted power constraints (MWPCs), and various physical constraints on MA positions. In both the SPC case and the MWPCs case, we optimize the MA positions by jointly employing the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methodologies. As for the precoding matrices optimization, by exploiting the uplink-downlink duality of MU-MIMO systems, we transform the downlink EE optimization into their virtual uplink EE optimization counterparts. Then, we derive the optimal structures of the precoding matrices, where the involved optimal power allocations take the multi-user water-filling solutions. To compute the parameters of the multi-user water-filling solutions, by taking advantage of the underlying algebraic monotonicity of the problem, we propose three novel design strategies, i.e., the direct Dinkelbach based design, the modified Dinkelbach based design, and the bound-ware penalty based design. In contrast to conventional fractional programming (FP) based EE optimization methods, the proposed algorithms offer significantly lower computational complexities and explicit physical insights. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and high efficiency of our proposed EE optimization algorithms."

    "abstract": "LiDAR sensors are critical for 3D scene perception in autonomous driving, providing high spatial accuracy but suffering from limited temporal resolution. Point cloud interpolation, which reconstructs intermediate frames from sparsely captured inputs, effectively enhances temporal continuity. However, the challenges posed by non-linear and non-rigid motion in dynamic scenarios remain unresolved by existing methods, which often sacrifice accuracy for efficiency. To solve the above problems, we propose MSTSINet (Multiscale Transformer and SSM Interpolation Network), a novel framework that combines multiscale forward flow prediction with non-linear trajectory compensation for fast and accurate interpolation. Unlike conventional bidirectional flow-based methods, our forward flow-guided approach reduces inference time while improving robustness to complex motion. MSTSINet integrates multiscale motion modeling through a novel hierarchical feature extraction and semantic-aware cross-frame attention, progressively improving forward flow estimation for accurate non-linear trajectory prediction. To further improve motion fidelity and temporal coherence, we introduce a point-wise compensation mechanism during inference and design a novel multiscale loss function that supervises forward flow learning across varying temporal resolutions. Experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that MSTSINet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 26.39% reduction in Chamfer Distance and substantially improving inference speed. These advantages make it well-suited for real-time deployment in autonomous driving scenarios."

Failure analysis (FA) via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is used to correlate electrical degradation with physical damage post-stress. In-depth analysis is performed from three key perspectives: the influence of averaging window selection on I–V curve fidelity, extraction and interpretation of decoupling capacitance and energy dissipation efficiency under CDM-like stress. Results highlight both the strengths and limitations of each protection method under fast transients, offering insight into optimal ESD design for long interconnect paths. Practical enhancements to the vf-TLP setup are also discussed. This study identifies layout-induced failure mechanisms too.

    "abstract": "Clinical assessment of idiopathic scoliosis (IS) patients primarily relies on static imaging techniques. Dynamic digital human (DDH) can provide comprehensive spatio-temporal information for dynamic assessment of the deformed spine in IS patients comparing with static imaging techniques, such as X-ray for general assessment and computed tomography (CT) for surgical planning. The lumbar vertebrae exhibit greater morphological variability than the thoracic region when subjected to different postures and mechanical loads, making them particularly important for dynamic assessment. Therefore, a personalized lumbar vertebrae model (PLVM) is proposed in this work to simulate lumbar vertebrae motion for IS patients; furthermore, an individualized DDH (i-DDH) is proposed by embedding PLVM into DDH to capture the spatio-temporal information. First, we use a bone primitive generation method to construct the DDH by incorporating Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and three-dimensional (3D) Gaussian splatting methods. Next, we develop the PLVM generation method to simulate lumbar vertebrae motion under different loads and postures. Finally, the bone primitives and PLVM are merged to generate the i-DDH for dynamic assessment. We validated i-DDH using multi-posture radiographs from eight IS patients awaiting surgery. The results demonstrate high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, with a mean angular error of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.96^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> and a maximum error of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3.6^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> relative to radiographs. The proposed i-DDH framework is able to capture the spinal posture and conduct the dynamic assessment of IS patients rather than fixed positions. It overcomes the soft tissue artifact (STA) problem from motion capture systems and the failure to generate 3D spinal deformity of IS patients by training healthy subjects from computer vision methods. It also shows great clinical significance for preoperative planning and clinical assessment by providing dynamic spinal posture that cannot be achieved with static imaging."

The system comprises a base station equipped with a large-scale uniform planar array (UPA) and a single-antenna user equipment operating in the radiative near-field region, where signal propagation needs to be carried out through distributed scatterers due to the direct communication obstruction. By leveraging the Markov chain-based energy buffer model, we derived closed-form outage-probability expression of the proposed system, along with the asymptotic outage-probability expression under high transmit power regime. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly outperforms buffer-less counterpart. Moreover, increasing the number of scatterers enhances system reliability due to multipath diversity, while square UPA configurations exhibit superior performance over rectangular arrays due to improved projected aperture efficiency. Furthermore, it is revealed that an optimal power-splitting factor can minimize the outage probability. These findings provide foundational insights for designing energy-efficient near-field communications in multipath-dominated environments."

However, the impact of peer government digital procurement (PGDP) on the digital innovation of focal firms remains underexplored, both theoretically and empirically. To address this gap, we apply the awareness-motivation-capability framework to investigate how PGDP influences focal firms digital innovation and its boundary conditions. We hypothesize that PGDP enhances firms awareness of digital innovation, motivating them to engage more actively in innovation efforts. This effect, we argue, depends on the firms' motivation and capability to respond to competitive pressures from peers. Specifically, industry competitive intensity and performance shortfall serve as key motivational factors, whereas ESG performance and innovation human resources are critical capability factors. Using data from Chinese listed firms between 2015 and 2023, we find strong empirical support for these hypotheses. After the robustness tests such as the instrumental variable method and system GMM, our conclusions remain unchanged. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the PGDP has a more significant effect on digital innovation in nonSOEs. Overall, this study provides new theoretical and empirical insights, highlighting digital innovation as a key strategy for firms to respond effectively to PGDP, with important implications for high-quality development in the digital economy."

    "abstract": "In the ride-hailing market, platforms such as Didi Chuxing are increasingly collaborating with taxi services through the integrated channel, like Simultaneous Ride-Hailing Request (SR). SR allows riders to submit a single request that includes both platform-based and taxi services, with the platform allocating each request to one of the two services and charging the corresponding price. To investigate the implications of SR, we develop an analytical model of a ride-hailing platform that integrates a platform-based service with self-scheduling drivers and a taxi service with fixed supply. Riders differ in their service preferences and sensitivity to driver availability. We find that although integrating the taxi service into the platform intensifies competition for riders between the two services, SR can yield a win-win outcome by improving both platform profitability and taxi utilization. In particular, SR enables the platform to serve additional riders without lowering the price and helps the taxi service alleviate demand loss caused by offline search frictions, thereby mitigating price competition across services. Moreover, we identify the sensitivity of self-scheduling drivers to rider availability as a key performance determinant driving these results. When self-scheduling drivers are sufficiently sensitive, SR adoption is profitable by enhancing supply–demand coordination. Finally, we confirm the robustness of our results by relaxing two key assumptions: allowing the platform to charge the commission fee on the taxi service and permitting platform-based riders to also use SR. Overall, this study provides new insights into platform–taxi cooperation and contributes to the broader understanding of sustainable ride-hailing markets."

    "abstract": "Broadcast and cellular converged networks (BCCNs) provide a promising solution to alleviate network congestion and improve user experience in environments such as massive-scale live streaming. However, existing studies on BCCNs mainly use a network-centric design paradigm where broadcast offloading is seen as just a network optimization tool, ignoring the interests of internet applications. As a result, this greatly limits their full potential. In this paper, we propose a novel Broadcast-as-a-Service framework for BCCNs, enabling broadcast network operators to provide dynamic on-demand broadcasting services to both internet applications and cellular network operators. Specifically, our proposed framework extends beyond traditional network-initiated offloading by allowing content providers to request broadcast offloading based on application-specific requirements. Furthermore, to enable dynamic on-demand broadcasting, we design a comprehensive metric to represent offloading benefits and formulate the offloading decision problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP), taking multi-stakeholder interests into account, including broadcast operators, cellular networks, and content providers. Last, we develop a Lyapunov-guided online offloading (LGO) algorithm to maximize offloading benefits while ensuring the long-term service violation rate does not exceed a predefined limit, avoiding frequent offloading switches. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method outperforms all baselines in offloading utility while reducing the service violation rate by more than 10X compared to the best-performing baseline algorithm."

Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is desirable for comprehensive evaluation, but it is traditionally formed by stitching a series of two-dimensional (2D) images, which is complicated and time-consuming. Here, an anisotropic volumetric total focusing method (AV-TFM) for CFRP laminates by using a 2D phased array was proposed. Firstly, the elastic constants were derived from the full matrix data. Then, the simplified QP-wave group velocity formula was derived to directly correlate the velocity and its angle. Therefore, the group velocities at any angle can be simply calculated. Finally, the anisotropic effect was corrected for 3D imaging by total focusing method efficiently and precisely. Simulations and experiments were conducted on different CFRP laminates with internal defects to verify the effectiveness of AV-TFM. Results prove that AV-TFM enables accurate volumetric imaging of anisotropic CFRP laminates, providing a simple and comprehensive avenue for non-destructive evaluation of large CFRP components during manufacturing and in service."

This paper considers a vehicular system with multiple self-driving vehicles that is assisted by multi-access edge computing (MEC), where image data collected by the sensors is offloaded from cellular vehicles to the MEC server using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Sensory data can also be shared among surrounding vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication links. To improve spectrum utilization, the V2V links may reuse the same frequency spectrum as the V2I links, which may cause severe interference. To tackle this issue, we leverage reconfigurable intelligent computational surfaces (RICSs) to jointly enable V2I reflective links and mitigate interference appearing at the V2V links. Considering the limitations of traditional algorithms in addressing this problem, such as the assumption of quasi-static channel state information, which restricts their ability to adapt to dynamic environmental changes and leads to poor performance under frequently varying channel conditions, in this paper, we formulate the problem at hand as a Markov game. Our novel formulation is applied to time-varying channels subject to multi-user interference and introduces a collaborative learning mechanism among users. The considered optimization problem is solved via a driving safety-enabled multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DS-MADRL) approach that capitalizes on the RICS presence. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase that the proposed reinforcement learning approach achieves faster convergence and significant enhancements in both data rate and driving safety, as compared to various state-of-the-art benchmarks."

The investigated formulations either constrained the contact force direction to remain within different shapes of a stability perimeter, or added a penalty term that discouraged contact force directions from deviating from the glenoid cavity center. All stability formulations predicted contact force magnitudes that agreed relatively well to the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> measured forces except for the strictest formulation that constrained the joint contact force directly to the glenoid cavity center. Constraint and conditional penalty models estimated force vectors that largely lay along the perimeters. Continuous penalty models estimated relatively more accurate contact force directions within the glenoid cavity than constraint models. Our findings support the proposed penalty formulations as more reasonable and accurate than other investigated existing glenohumeral stability formulations."

While existing methods perform well in specific scenarios, their efficiency and the quality of the resulting paths and trajectories often degrade in dense or irregular environments. In this paper, we propose a unified motion planning framework for mobile manipulators. It consists of two parts: a sampling-based path planner with feasibility-aware focus regions for efficient path generation, and a WA-QN optimizer that adaptively filters and aggregates curvature information to enhance convergence in high-dimensional spaces. Comprehensive experiments in simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves faster planning, higher success rates, and superior path and trajectory quality, while exhibiting strong generalization across diverse environments."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of vibration suppression, reference tracking, constraint satisfaction, and disturbance rejection in robot servo systems with flexible joints, this paper presents a novel model predictive control (MPC) framework that integrates output regulation theory and disturbance observer (DO) techniques. First, multi-source disturbances in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)-driven robot servo systems-including torsional torque, multi-frequency torque ripple, and parameter uncertainties-are uniformly modeled via output regulation theory as an exosystem. Then, the multi-source disturbances are estimated using a reduced-order DO. Based on these estimations and output regulation theory, a transformed dynamic model is developed that inherently embeds the optimal reference trajectory, eliminating the need for separate trajectory optimization. Furthermore, the tracking problem of the original disturbed system is reformulated as a stabilization problem for the transformed system, which is then addressed by the proposed output regulation MPC (ORMPC) scheme that explicitly incorporates state and control input constraints. Finally, experimental results on a PMSM-driven robot servo system coupled via a spring demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC framework."

    "abstract": "Generative AI models such as Stable Diffusion are increasingly used to support creative ideation, but their low-resolution outputs limit practical use in design workflows. This study addresses this gap by comparing three super-resolution (SR) models Flux, SUPIR, and Ultimate SD on sneaker-specific generative images, focusing on user-centered perceptual outcomes rather than only PSNR/SSIM metrics. A within-subject user study (N=17) was conducted with images upscaled from 512×512 to 1024×1024 pixels, followed by post-experiment interviews. SUPIR achieved the lowest perceived change counts (M=1.06 vs. Ultimate M=5.12, p<.01) and reduced perceived change ratios by up to 68% relative to Ultimate. In subjective ratings, SUPIR scored highest for efficiency (M=5.94) and shape consistency (M=6.29), significantly outperforming Flux and Ultimate (p<.01). Interview participants frequently described SUPIR as “best preserving the original design,” while Ultimate was criticized for “introducing unnecessary visual changes.” These results highlight a misalignment between conventional metrics and user perception and emphasize the need for perceptual and workflow-aware evaluation. By combining quantitative and qualitative findings, this study provides actionable insights for selecting SR models that preserve design intent and improve designer satisfaction in AI-assisted design workflows."

However, their complexity poses challenges for resource - constrained scenarios, particularly due to the high computational demands of Transformers and their excessive reliance on global information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi - channel Feature Integration Network (MCFINet), designed to maximize input pixel utilization while minimizing computational overhead. It integrates both local and global features within the channels, thereby exploiting their complementary advantages. First, the designed Feature Integration Block (FIB) effectively captures local information and improves visual quality by enhancing the mapping of non - local features. Subsequently, we utilize the Adaptive Channel Fusion Block (ACFB), which strengthens the interaction between features and channels while maintaining computational efficiency. Finally, for SR task on resource-constrained surface scenarios, we propose a more suitable pre-training method, which further boosts the model’s learning ability. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed MCFINet achieves a better balance between lightweight design and high-quality restoration on both standard evaluation datasets and water surface target datasets. Specifically, compared to the traditional SwinIR-L, MCFINet reduces model training time and runtime by 12% on the test set, while also decreasing model complexity by 43%.

Despite the increasing interest in marker less approaches, existing studies often utilize limited datasets, are captured from a single viewpoint, and struggle to distinguish individuals with similar walking styles or physical characteristics. This study introduces a gait-based identification pipeline that utilizes normal walking video data from 17 participants with diverse anthropometric profiles. The system applies Blaze Pose to extract 33 key points from frontal and lateral views, from which 35 features are engineered to represent anthropometric, kinematic, and statistical aspects of gait. These features are then classified using various machine learning models to evaluate performance. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) achieved the best results, with a recognition accuracy of 97.06 % and a low false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1838 %. Compared to prior methods that often focus on constrained data with minimal viewpoint variation, the proposed system demonstrates improved generalizability and robustness when recognizing individuals with similar gait patterns. The use of both anthropometric and dynamic features from multi-angle video further enhances its discriminatory power. Overall, the proposed approach proves to be a reliable and efficient solution for gait-based biometric identification, suitable for real-world applications such as intelligent surveillance and user authentication. It also lays a solid foundation for future studies in more complex or unconstrained environments."

    "abstract": "In recent years, as the number of individuals suspected of having diabetes continues to rise, the need for continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels has become more significant. However, commonly used household blood glucose testing methods are invasive, which not only creates physical and emotional burdens for users but also increases the risk of infections. As a result, the development of safe and non-invasive glucose monitoring devices is highly desired. A technique for non-destructive and non-invasive measurement of sugar content in fruits using optical sensors has already been established. By focusing on the near-infrared spectroscopy employed in this technique, the objective is to construct a non-invasive method for measuring blood glucose levels. This paper explores a method for estimating glucose concentration by combining near-infrared spectroscopy using an optical sensor and machine learning. First, a prediction model for glucose concentration is developed using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained with absorbance data covering the entire wavelength range from 680 to 2500 nm, obtained via near-infrared spectroscopy, which is considered safe for the human body. Then, for practical use, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is applied to identify the wavelength regions emphasized by the model during prediction. Finally, this paper examines a method to estimate glucose concentration by using an MLP model trained only on absorbance data from selected wavelengths. Prediction accuracy is evaluated using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), with a target of 0.1% or less to distinguish between pre- and postprandial glucose levels. As a result, the model trained with all wavelengths achieves a MAPE of 0.0593%. Models using eight and seven selected wavelengths achieve MAPE values of 0.0773% and 0.0658%, respectively, both meeting the target threshold. Moreover, even with only four to six wavelengths, glucose estimation remains possible with a MAPE below 0.2%."

For the actual channel we use input output expressions in DopplerDelay (DD) domain, where fractional Doppler shifts and delays are introduced. For estimation we use channel model in DD domain with delays and Doppler shifts on the grid to generate the OMP sensing matrix. The channel estimation does not account for the fractional Doppler shifts and delays, i.e. uses integer Doppler shifts and delays. To evaluate the algorithm performance for different fractional Doppler shifts we use the estimation Mean Square Error and the detection symbol error rate. The purpose is to ascertain the appropriate circumstances for OMP’s application without significant performance loss. To improve channel estimation performance, we also use refined DD domain grid for OMP estimation i.e. larger dictionary of the sensing matrix."

This paper presents an experimental investigation on alternating shed-type polymer insulators subjected to high voltage under various surface contaminations, including dust and water, as well as controlled humidity and temperature. Measurements were conducted in a high-voltage laboratory environment, incorporating leakage current monitoring, THD (total harmonic distortion) analysis, and contact angle evaluation. The study also examines the effectiveness of silicone oil coating as a surface treatment to enhance hydrophobicity and suppress leakage current. Post-coating results revealed a reduction or stabilization of leakage current across all tested conditions, with the water-contaminated case decreasing from 0.048 mA to 0.044 mA. THD values also slightly improved, accompanied by an increase in average contact angle from 70.5° to 81.5°, indicating enhanced surface hydrophobicity. These improvements limit moisture film formation and conductive paths on the insulator surface. Additionally, the alternating shed geometry demonstrated superior resistance to surface tracking and arcing under polluted environments. This study provides comprehensive insight into the combined impact of geometry and hydrophobic coating on the electrical performance of polymer insulators and offers practical recommendations for improving their reliability in harsh outdoor applications."

Through a literature review, it summarizes the latest achievements in the accounting methods of life cycle carbon emissions of substation buildings, key links and decarbonization strategies for carbon emissions in power transmission and transformation projects, and influencing factors and optimization design of carbon emissions. Taking a 220kV power transmission and transformation project in Anhui Province as a case study, it analyzes the carbon emission characteristics of the project in four stages: building materials production and transportation, construction, operation and maintenance, and demolition and recycling. It also uses a \"bottom-up\" model to account for the life cycle carbon emissions of the project. The study finds that the building materials production and transportation stage and the operation and maintenance stage are the key links of carbon emissions in the power transmission and transformation project, accounting for 34.7% and 64.1%, respectively. Based on this, the paper proposes decarbonization paths such as optimizing the selection of building materials, improving equipment energy efficiency and energy-saving transformation, establishing intelligent operation and maintenance systems, and using low-carbon demolition technologies. These measures aim to achieve the carbon reduction goals of the entire life cycle of power transmission and transformation projects and provide scientific support for the power industry to contribute to the \"dual carbon\" goals."

    "abstract": "Wearable systems hold great promise for the early screening of dysphagia. However, existing studies have largely focused on the recognition and classification of specific food types, lacking objective quantitative research based on the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative (IDDSI). In this paper, we present an acoustic-impedance dual modal pharyngeal wearable system (AI-DPWS) for synchronous acquisition and quantitative analysis of swallowing impedance and acoustic signals from the aged subjects on taking eight viscosity levels of food defined by IDDSI. First, the implementation of AI-DPWS is described. Next, dual modal signals are collected from 30 aged participants in the IDDSI protocol, and four kinetics metrics are extracted, that is two acoustic features (swallowing sound duration (SSD), half-energy duration (HED)) and two impedance features (pharyngeal phase duration (PPD) and pharyngeal impedance variations (PIV)). Finally, statistical methods are applied to compare and analyze swallowing characteristic differences at different IDDSI levels. The results show that SSD and PPD are lengthened by 0.54 s and 0.38 s, respectively in IDDSI levels from 0 to 7. Similarly, HED rises from $0.29 \\pm 0.04 \\mathrm{~s}$ to $0.52 \\pm 0.17 \\mathrm{~s}$, and PIV increases from $50 \\pm 8 \\mathrm{mV}$ to $71 \\pm 14 \\mathrm{mV}$ with the increase of the IDDSI levels. Moreover, PIV and PPD exhibit a strong positive correlation ($\\mathbf{r} \\boldsymbol{=} \\mathbf{0. 9 9 2}$), and mean adjacent-level Cohen’s d ranges from 0.5 to 1.0. These results demonstrate that the dual-modal measurement signals effectively achieve complementarity in monitoring swallowing process, and exhibit richer feature information for discriminating different IDDSI levels. This study provides a novel approach for swallowing function assessment based on the IDDSI framework and could offer experimental evidence for further research on the age-related dysphagia."

The system adopts a three-layer architecture, including the perception layer, edge layer and cloud layer. Each layer works together to realize the real-time collection, processing and management of user physiological parameters. In order to improve the model training efficiency and prediction accuracy of the system, an original adaptive weighted federated edge learning algorithm (AWFEL) is proposed. The algorithm dynamically evaluates the data quality and computing power of edge nodes, assigns adaptive weights to nodes, and combines local differential privacy technology to protect user privacy. Experimental simulation results show that compared with the traditional federated learning algorithm, the prediction accuracy of the AWFEL algorithm is improved by an average of 8.3%, and the training time is shortened by an average of 21.7%; compared with the centralized learning algorithm, the data transmission volume is reduced by an average of 68.5%, and the system response delay is reduced by an average of 75%, which is only 120 ms. At the same time, the data leakage probability of the system is less than 0.1%, and the privacy protection level is $\\mathbf{1. 2}$ times that of the industry standard.

This study addresses the need for a realistic channel modelling approach by analyzing the performance of the Clustered Delay Line (CDL) channel in Jakarta's urban environment. The research employs ray-tracing simulations to evaluate the effects of varying transmitter antenna height, elevation angle, and reflection order on signal propagation characteristics. Using a fixed elevation angle of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$45^{\\circ}$</tex> and reflection order of 5, simulations were conducted for two antenna heights: 4 meters and 10 meters. The results indicate that increasing the antenna height from 4 m to 10 m reduced the number of significant multipath reflections and improved signal quality. Path loss values ranged from 65 dB to 160 dB at 4 m, with more severe signal degradation, while the 10 m configuration showed fewer zones exceeding 130 dB. Furthermore, the instantaneous channel gain improved by approximately <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6-10 ~\\text{dB}$</tex> on average when using the higher antenna position, and magnitude-squared responses across OFDM symbols and subcarriers showed reduced fading intensity.

Reciprocating compressors are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high-pressure delivery and operational flexibility. However, their complex internal flow dynamics, transient valve behavior, and thermal interactions pose significant challenges for performance prediction and optimization. The proposed framework integrates a one-dimensional (1D) model based on the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy to simulate the entire compressed air station. This includes detailed sub-models for key components: the cylinder (using thermodynamic principles), valves (modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system), plenum chambers, and pipelines. The model is applied to a two-stage air compressor to analyze the coupled effects of inter-stage pressure imbalance, valve dynamics, and heat transfer on compressor efficiency. The simulation reveals significant dynamic phenomena, such as transient flow reversal in the second-stage discharge valve and pressure drops caused by valve dynamics, which are quantified in the p-V diagrams. The results contribute to the development of more efficient and reliable multi-stage reciprocating compressor systems for industrial applications."

Specifically, bearing vibration signals are segmented and transformed into path graphs, where edge weights are assigned using HMM modelling. These weighted graphs are then processed by the graph attention network for diagnostic classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMM-weighted path graph construction method outperforms alternative approaches, significantly enhancing bearing fault diagnosis accuracy."

    "abstract": "Early detection of malfunctions in industrial machinery is critical for minimizing downtime and ensuring production efficiency. Although deep learning approaches based on acoustic signals have shown promising results, many existing models rely on single-feature inputs or lack robustness in noisy environments—limiting their effectiveness in real-world factory settings. In this study, we propose AFT-Net (Acoustic Fusion Transformer Network), a deep learning framework that integrates convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components to robustly detect machine faults from acoustic signals under varying noise conditions. To enhance feature diversity and improve discriminative capability, AFT-Net fuses three complementary audio representations: Mel spectrograms, MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), and spectral contrast. These features respectively capture perceptual frequency energy distributions, spectral envelope structures, and harmonic–noise patterns. The fused multimodal representation is processed through a hierarchical architecture composed of convolutional encoders for local time–frequency pattern extraction, a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sequential dependency modeling, and a Transformer encoder to capture global contextual relationships via self-attention. This design significantly improves the model’s ability to detect subtle and temporally extended fault anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves high classification accuracy and remains robust across diverse machine sound anomalies, confirming its practicality for real-world industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) aims to identify anomalies using models trained on minimal samples, a task made particularly challenging in real-world scenarios due to domain shifts caused by variations in lighting conditions, object pose, and other environmental factors. Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise in FSAD visual tasks. However, most of existing approaches often rely on manually designed prompts to capture anomaly semantics, which are susceptible to environmental interference and labor-intensive to implement. To address this issue, we propose a cross-domain CLIP for anomaly detection (CDADCLIP) to adapt CLIP for FSAD under conditions with domain shift. CDADCLIP incorporates domain-invariant learnable prompts into CLIP to model normal and abnormal semantics. Furthermore, a Hybrid Semantic Fusion (HSF) module is utilized to enhance anomaly detection performance by integrating region-level information with global features. Experimental results on the AeBAD-S dataset with domain shift demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with existing state-of-the-art methods."

By taking into account historical Bitcoin data from 2013 to 2024, we make use of a process involving data normalization, feature importance selection, and model evaluation to do research. We preprocess several features comprising price returns, trading volume, and market capitalization and also generate technical indicators such as volatility and momentum metrics. We perform feature importance by two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest feature importance that are mutually supportive. Later on, we measure the detection performance of Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithms for the different feature subsets. From our experiments, we see that the features selected by the Random Forest reached the highest model agreement (95.90%) and anomaly overlap (54.73%) that is far better than that of both the complete feature set and PCA-selected features. Short-term volatility indicator, price momentum as well as the number of trades appeared as very informative features for the detection of market anomalies. Theadetected anomalies were in line with Bitcoin market major events such as the period of 2017-2018 bubble burst, March 2020 market crash, and 2021's bull run. These results show that if feature subsets are precisely chosen, they can improve anomaly detection consistency in cryptocurrency markets and can even supply market surveillance and risk management systems with new insights."

In smart grids, the Internet of Things (IoT) adds a range of protocols that constantly result in numerous zero-day attacks. In recent years, much attention has been paid to cybersecurity due to the advancement of deep learning (DL) in different areas related to big data. DL can extract high-level characteristics to detect new attacks and small mutations in cyberspaces. In this paper, a smart false data injection attack (FDIA) detection method for smart islands is presented by using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to extract features to be used as the inputs of deep neural networks (DNNs). This method extracts statistical features from the information by preprocessing it with HHT. Once all information has been input into DNNs, manipulated data is developed. A comparison of the efficiency of the deep model with conventional machine learning methods demonstrates that the suggested attack diagnosis system is more useful in detecting attacks than conventional approaches."

A pre-trained Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) network forecasts short-term traffic states, such as vehicle density and speed, which informs and improves the controller's responsiveness to upcoming conditions. Simulations conducted in the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) environment, based on a realistic sketch of a highdensity urban roundabout in Ho Chi Minh City, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional Riccati and Riccati+LQR controllers. Compared to the Riccati baseline, the LSTM-enhanced controller achieves a 7.9 % increase in average speed, a 29.39 % reduction in average trip duration, a 57.97 % decrease in waiting time, and a 42.64 % reduction in time loss, while maintaining consistent vehicle throughput.

This paper first establishes a fourth-order frequency response model for virtual inertia control with a high-pass filter and simplifies it to a second-order model using the Routh reduction method. By comparing the simulation results of the second-order model with those of the actual electromechanical transient model, it is demonstrated that the second-order model can accurately reflect the key frequency transient characteristics of the practical system, including maximum frequency deviation and steady-state deviation. Building on this, the sensitivity of the virtual inertia parameter K<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">w</inf>, low-pass filter time constant T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf>, and high-pass filter time constant T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">w</inf> to the system's maximum frequency deviation is analyzed.

In this study, based on the ADNI database, a variety of regression models were applied to predict the brain age of AD patients by preprocessing Tau-PET and T1-weighted MRI images of 310 subjects (NC, MCI, and AD patients), constructing a brain network, and extracting key features. The results showed that the multiple linear regression and random forest regression models performed excellently in terms of prediction accuracy and model fit, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 4.16 and 4.19 years and coefficients of determination of 0.40 and 0.39, respectively. In addition, the present study found that the APOE 4 gene carrier status had a significant effect on brain age disparity. Individuals carrying the APOE 4 gene exhibited a greater brain age gap, and this effect was especially significant in subjects carrying two APOE4 alleles."

The architecture integrates two core modules: (1) A spatio-temporal feature extraction module combining convolutional neural networks for local spatial patterns and bidirectional stabilized long short-term memory (BisLSTM) for long-term dependencies; (2) A self-attention feature enhancement module introducing a multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize discriminative feature weights. Real data from aero-engines are applied to validate the performance of the model. Experimental results manifest that the CNN-BisLSTM-Attention model outperforms the comparison models in prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "The magnetic levitation conveyor system consists of two primary components: the levitation system and the drive system. This article proposes a drive system for a long stroke magnetic levitation conveyor. The mover has the characteristics of low mass, high-frequency noise suppression, fast dynamic response, and low disturbance. First, the no-load magnetic field model is developed using the equivalent surface current method. Subsequently, the parameters of the drive system are modeled and analyzed. Utilizing these parameters as fundamental inputs, a state-space equation for the system is established. Furthermore, to account for the mechanical and electrical coupling of the bilateral mover, parameter asymmetry and mutual-inductance coupling are incorporated into the state-space equations, resulting in a model of the drive system. The open-loop response is analyzed to reveal the inherent characteristics and dynamic behaviors of the drive system. Finally, based on the inherent characteristics of the drive system, the fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller is designed for displacement and speed control. Moreover, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to optimize multiple controller parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller parameters optimized using the PSO algorithm ensure stable displacement control. Additionally, the displacement precision of the magnetic drive system is enhanced by the FOPID controller. Experimental verification confirms that the analytical model achieves high computational accuracy."

However, vessel overlap, background noise, and nonlinear cardiac motion introduce significant challenges. These factors often result in missed detections, intra-frame class conflict, and temporal category drift, particularly for subtle and morphologically complex stenoses such as focal and bifurcation stenoses. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Aggregation Network that effectively integrates both spatial and temporal cues across XRA sequences. The proposed framework incorporates a Channel Importance-guided Fusion module, which aims to enhance the representation of small-stenosis features by dynamically selecting high-importance channels across scales. Furthermore, we introduce a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Aggregator designed to reduce spatial redundancy and explicitly generate discriminative features across frames based on heterogeneous relationships, thereby improving temporal consistency and classification robustness. Existing experiments conducted on two clinical datasets indicate that our method outperforms existing detectors and stenosis methods in terms of detection accuracy and generalization."

    "abstract": "In severely impaired stroke patients without visible movements, implementing robot-assisted therapy based on movement intention decoded from electromyogram (EMG) requires both sufficient residual EMG to drive robotic assistance and a patient-specific detector to ensure accurate, low-latency detection. However, identifying such a detector is challenging, particularly when the presence of residual EMG in a given patient is unknown. This paper proposes a systematic approach to distinguish between EMG data when the patient is relaxed versus attempting a movement.We investigated six different detector types and separation measures using retrospective EMG data from a previous randomized controlled trial. The results indicate that the approximate generalized likelihood ratio (AGLR) detector, along with the modified Hodges and modified Lidierth detectors, achieved the best separation between the data when a subject is relaxed compared to when he/she attempts movements. Using a subset of clinician-annotated data to evaluate detection performance, the modified Hodges detector combined with probability difference-sum ratio measure (MH-PDSR) showed good performance in terms of both accuracy and latency. Based on the EMG data from 30 severe stroke, we propose a PDSR threshold of 0.7 with the modified Hodges detector to identify patients with sufficient residual EMG. These findings suggest that the MH-PDSR approach can be used to learn a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">maximally separating detector</i> for a given patient which can be used both to screen patients for residual EMG and to provide a detector to drive robotic assistance if residual EMG is present.

Recently, neural radiance field-based implicit representation has demonstrated outstanding performance in a variety of reconstruction tasks.

The issue of voids in solder joints in semiconductor packaging devices significantly affects the performance and reliability of the full package. In this research, a comprehensive study on the void formation in solder joints was conducted using 2D and 3D X-ray imaging techniques, focusing on SnSbAg and SnSbCuAg solder types in Power SiC MOSFETs. These devices were subjected to industry-standard JEDEC High-Temperature Storage Life (HTSL) test set at 175 °C for up to 2000h. A consistent direct proportion of void formation percentage with RDS(on) was revealed, indicating a strong correlation of the hindered charge carrier mechanism resulting from micro-void formation. Herein, we derived a theoretical formula envisaging the correlation of 2D and 3D X-ray void imaging techniques with a highly regarded R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.959 and 0.937 for SnSbAg and SnSbCuAg, respectively.

    "abstract": "Industrial IoT (IIoT) sensing nodes for bearing monitoring often operate in high-noise environments, where acoustic and mechanical interference masks weak fault signatures and undermines diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight multi-modal fusion framework for robust fault diagnosis under extreme noise. Our method first applies multi-resolution decomposition with selective reconstruction and adaptive enhancement to preserve fault-related components while suppressing interference. The enhanced signals are transformed from 1D time series into two-dimensional representations to jointly capture temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. We then design a tri-branch multi-head attention architecture that integrates a multiscale recurrence plot network, a Gramian angular field network, and a lightweight residual network. Learnable attention weights enable adaptive fusion of complementary cross-modal features with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the CWRU benchmark show superior robustness from 0 dB to -6 dB SNR, with a mean accuracy above 99.6% and consistent gains over eight state-of-the-art methods. Additional tasks on single-domain diagnosis, cross-condition fault type recognition, and fault degree discrimination (T1–T3) confirm strong generalization and multi-scale adaptability, with average improvements of 2–4% over the second-best baseline and stable variance under noise. The compact architecture and high noise immunity indicate practical suitability for IIoT sensing nodes and edge deployment in complex industrial scenarios."

    "abstract": "Effective self-regulation is crucial for student success; however, many students struggle with it, especially during online activities, leading to disengagement. Existing methods to boost self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, such as writing self-reflective reports and using prompts in video lectures, lack timely, personalized feedback and can be labor-intensive. This study implemented the Self-Regulated Learning AI Mentor (SRLMentor), a system designed to support students' SRL skills, including goal-setting, planning, help seeking, and reflection. SRLMentor comprises three integrated modules to provide timely customized SRL feedback to each student. The first module features an SRL knowledge base that stores user chat records and relevant memory-driven adaptive SRL prompts, addressing a significant limitation of large language models—inability to store new experiences in long-term memory during a dialogue. The second module incorporates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) component to reduce content hallucinations, ensuring that students receive accurate information. The third module provides in-context learning examples that instruct the AI-based chatbot system to produce relevant SRL responses. We evaluated SRLMentor in an eight-session course with 25 students. Our assessment focused on RAG's performance in terms of factual consistency, answer correctness, and semantic similarity; accuracy of SRLMentor's detection of students' goals and plans compared to human coders; quality of SRLMentor's feedback; and students' perceptions of the system's usefulness. The results revealed that RAG enhanced factual, correctness, and semantic accuracy of responses. Additionally, SRLMentor's assessments of students' goals and plans closely matched those of human coders. The cluster analysis revealed that students who engaged more with SRLMentor exhibited greater improvement in SRL skills and course knowledge compared to those who engaged less frequently with the system."

Second, the model is extended to handle multiple simultaneous point contacts, enabling effective trajectory planning and tracking for a redundant robotic arm in multi-contact pushing tasks. Third, an RL strategy is introduced as a residual module that augments a model-based controller to improve pushing performance. Simulation and real-world experiments with a Kinova Gen2 arm demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate trajectory following and stable contact interactions, significantly outperforming traditional PD control strategies in dynamic pushing scenarios."

The antenna features a single-layer design, consisting of a substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity and a square metal patch, fed by a pair of symmetrically placed coaxial probes. When one port of the antenna is excited, the superposition of the TE110 mode generated by the SIW cavity and the TM01 mode generated by the patch creates an electric field null region around the unexcited port, achieving a measured peak port isolation of 48 dB without the need for additional decoupling structures. To further reduce the antenna size, a quasi-TEM SIW cavity with a lower resonant frequency than TE110 mode is employed. The miniaturized SIW cavity’s TE010 mode is used in combination with a modified patch’s TM01 mode to achieve high port isolation. Measurements demonstrate isolation greater than 22 dB across the entire operating band, with a peak isolation of 53 dB, while reducing the structure size from 0.70λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> × 0.70λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> × 0.03λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> to 0.39λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> × 0.39λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> × 0.04λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>.

To address this gap, this study presents a Data Governance Process Capability Model (DG-PCM) grounded in the ISO/IEC 330xx standards. Building on a well-accepted Design Science Research (DSR) approach, the study develops and evaluates the DG-PCM as the designed artifact. The DSR framework guided the integration of complementary methods—including literature review, Modified-Delphi analysis, and case study—to iteratively design, validate, and refine the model. Developed through a systematic, multi-stage research approach, the model synthesizes insights from a comprehensive review of 326 academic studies and the practical perspectives of industry experts obtained via the Delphi method. The DG-PCM structures data governance processes into four primary domains—Data, Organization, Strategy, and Technology—encompassing eighteen distinct processes, each evaluated across six capability levels, from Level 0 (Not Performed) to Level 5 (Innovating). To assess the model’s practical relevance, a case study conducted within a manufacturing organization validated its utility in aligning data governance practices with broader organizational goals. This structured approach not only fills a critical gap in the literature but also provides a standardized, unbiased, and comprehensive framework for assessing data governance maturity. The findings indicate that the DG-PCM offers a robust foundation for continuous improvement, strategic alignment, and data-driven decision-making, positioning it as a vital tool for organizations seeking to enhance their data governance capabilities in an increasingly data-centric environment."

    "abstract": "Terahertz cavities with high quality factors are essential for sensing and oscillation stabilization applications. Planar photonic crystal cavities are promising owing to their compact size, which is convenient for integration purposes. Moreover, being a transmission-type cavity, it is useful for stabilizing terahertz oscillations, which is essential for high quality wireless communications. However, reported quality factors of planar photonic crystal cavities in the terahertz range are still moderate because the total loss was not effectively suppressed. In this paper, we propose an efficient and simple approach to reduce the total loss and, consequently, improve the quality factor of photonic crystal cavities. We propose simultaneously employing short embedded waveguides and properly displacing edged holes to reduce loss, thereby enhancing the quality factor. In more detail, the short embedded waveguides lead to the coupling loss and the in-plane loss reduction, while the latter corresponds to out-plane loss reduction. Moreover, in this work, the out-plane loss was analyzed and validated using the Fourier transform of the electric field. Proposed cavities were fabricated and characterized. High loaded quality factors of up to ~2.1× 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> were obtained. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest measured quality factor of a planar photonic crystal cavity in the terahertz range. Additionally, the proposed terahertz cavity also has the advantage of compactness. We believe the presented design of the terahertz photonic crystal cavity will promote promising terahertz applications such as sensing and high data rate wireless communications."

    "abstract": "Accurate retinal Microvascular segmentation demands a balanced combination of anatomical fidelity and hemodynamic relevance. However, existing methods fall short in preserving critical structures such as capillary junctions and bifurcations, thus limiting clinical applications and causing fragmentation. To address these limitations, we propose DFMS-Net, a novel dual-field segmentation framework that synergistically integrates geometric-field modeling—achieved through the Spatial Pathway Extractor (SPE) and Transformer-based Topology Interaction (TTI) for preserving structural continuity—and functional-field optimization—realized by the Semantic Attention Amplification (SAA) module for enhancing semantic visibility—via a unified Dual-Field Hemodynamic Attention (DFHA) mechanism. This core module enables joint enhancement of vessel continuity, accurate resolution of complex branching patterns, and recovery of low-contrast capillaries, all under physiological guidance. By co-optimizing geometric and functional cues within a unified attention learning paradigm, DFMS-Net produces segmentations that are both morphologically accurate and hemodynamically plausible. Furthermore, we propose two specialized variants using a streamlined Double SPE Attention for vessel continuity refinement. To address the directionality-dependent nature of structural damage in retinal ischemia and glaucoma, we propose Variant-1—a streamlined architecture that emphasizes dual-stage directional refinement to enhance trajectory coherence and improve the detection of topological disruptions, while Variant-2 supports high-resolution analysis of capillary dropout in early diabetic retinopathy through detailed microvascular recovery. Extensive experiments on retinal (DRIVE, STARE) and coronary angiography (DCA1, CHUAC) datasets demonstrate that DFMS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, its strong generalization capability offers a promising foundation for diagnosing both retinal and cardiovascular diseases.

    "abstract": "Accurate emotion recognition of Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICV) drivers plays a crucial role in mitigating driving risks caused by emotional fluctuations, thereby enhancing road safety and improving driving experiences. Current approaches predominantly suffer from two critical limitations, reliance on single-modality emotional data analysis and neglect of individual personality differences that significantly influence emotional manifestations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Personality-aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition Network (PMERNet) that synergistically integrates psychological theory with multimodal learning. Specifically, we first design an end-edge collaborative architecture that optimizes resource allocation between vehicle terminals and roadside units (RSUs), enabling efficient multimodal data collection (end-side) and collaborative feature processing (edge-side). Second, we develop a Weighted Temporal Background Attention module (WTBA-VExt) for robust facial expression analysis and implement a cross-modal self-attention Transformer for explicit multimodal feature fusion. Third, incorporating the psychological Big Five personality theory, we propose a Multimodal Big Five Personality Extractor (Multi-BFPExt) to capture latent personality traits and establish a bidirectional cross-modal fusion mechanism for personality-enhanced emotion recognition. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PMERNet achieves statistically significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching superior performance in both accuracy and weighted F1-score. Notably, the weighted F1-score is enhanced by 1.16%."

    "abstract": "We report the first experimental characterization of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in coupled-core multi-core fibers (MCFs). The experiment was performed using field-deployed fibers, with two complementary methodologies. First, the effective Raman gain coefficient was directly measured over a bandwidth of 120 nm – covering the upper S-, C- and lower L-bands – with the Raman pump being injected into different combinations of fiber cores and using either co- or counter-propagating signal. Second, we analyzed the spectral power tilt induced by SRS when transmitting a wavelength-division multiplexed signal spanning the entire C-band from 1529.4 nm to 1564.2 nm, which was found to be in agreement with the Raman gain coefficient measurements. Measurements performed on a co-deployed standard single-mode fiber (SMF) produced similar results. This observation, together with the notion that the Raman gain coefficient should be similar in MCFs and SMFs, validates our earlier derived model of SRS in fibers with strong mode mixing."

By incorporating a parameter-adaptive fuzzy inference system, a complete mechatronic simulation environment is constructed. Simulation show that, compared to traditional PID control, the proposed strategy cuts the step response time to 0.4 s and eliminates startup overshoot. Under a ±150-Nm step disturbance, speed fluctuation amplitude drops by 25%, resolving the poor adaptability caused by fixed quantization factors in traditional fuzzy control, with dynamic domain adjustment achieved."

This study investigates the impact of optimally sizing and locating Distributed Generation (DG) units in 10- and 33-bus test feeders using an exhaustive search method (ESM) for load flow solution. Different case studies, including the DG integration working in unity, addressing lagging and achieving optimal power factors, are investigated. The ESM guarantees the global optimum for both networks and is a benchmark for heuristic approaches. Results show that adding a single DG can reduce total real-power loss by up to $70 \\%$, while adding two DGs minimizes the loss to more than $85 \\%$. Loss reduction is maximized when the DG operates at the optimal power factor, while the voltage profiles improve. Although computation time rises sharply with feeder size, the method remains tractable for medium-scale systems and provides an indispensable yardstick for validating faster meta-heuristics. The findings highlight the operational value of coordinated DG placement and power-factor control for utilities planning high-penetration renewable resources."

This study proposes modifying the YOLOv8 architecture with patch-based image segmentation techniques to improve edge computing devices' detection accuracy and inference efficiency. Four model configurations were evaluated: YOLOv8 baseline, YOLOv8 with patches, modified YOLOv8, and the proposed model, which is modified YOLOv8 with patches. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the best detection performance, with a mean mAP@0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 87%, precision of 0.98, recall of 0.77, and the highest F1-Score of 0.89. Additionally, this model demonstrates superior inference efficiency, with an execution time of 1.9 ms/image on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, 21 seconds/image on a Raspberry Pi, and 121.1 ms/image on a Jetson Nano. Memory consumption is also the lowest, at 308.62 MB on Raspberry Pi and 278.82 MB on Jetson Nano. These results indicate that modifying YOLOv8 with patch-based preprocessing improves detection accuracy and enables practical deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources. This makes the model highly suitable for real-time agricultural monitoring applications in resourceconstrained environments."

    "abstract": "As the industry with the highest share of carbon emissions in the industrial sector, the steel industry plays a critical role in achieving China's dual carbon goals. Accurate carbon emission forecasting for the steel sector is therefore of great importance. However, such forecasting faces dual challenges of incomplete and delayed user data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic carbon emission prediction method for steel enterprises based on electricity consumption data. First, typical process flows in the steel industry are analyzed, and an energy-carbon emission process knowledge graph is constructed to uncover the relationships between key equipment and carbon emissions. Then, an electricity-carbon coupling model is proposed, using energy as a bridge. Based on the process knowledge graph, major carbon sources and critical equipment are identified, and a coupling model is established using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and multivariate regression. The energy-carbon conversion coefficients of each process are predicted using a rolling Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Grey relational analysis is employed to achieve carbon emission forecasting for steel enterprises. Finally, a case study of a representative steel enterprise in southern China is conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show that the prediction accuracy exceeds 95%."

Unlike traditional media, social networks provide a dynamic environment where users actively shape conversations and influence spreads quickly in multiple directions. In this context, influencers have a crucial role to spread information and shape opinions. However, the measure of influence of these individuals goes beyond simple engagement metrics. Because people interact in so many different ways and talk about a variety of topics online, this becomes complicated. We use a hybrid analytical technique that combines interaction based network signals with textual data to solve this. In order to model uncertainty and partial evidence from user interactions (likes, mentions, retweets), we suggest a methodological approach that combines belief function theory with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify primary subjects in textual data. This approach allows us to identify influencer’s domain authority and provides a robust process to observe influence trajectories by various thematic clusters. It entitles computational social scientists to create complex models of participation and effect on the digital sphere."

Firstly, the abrupt times of zero-sequence voltage, and abrupt features of negative sequence current amplitude and fault phase current of four typical single-phase faults, namely single-phase grounding, disconnection without grounding, disconnection with load-side grounding and disconnection with power-side grounding are analyzed. Secondly, by applying a multi-electrical quantity fusion criterion, different fault types are effectively distinguished. Thirdly, the fault section is located by analyzing the similarity of zero-sequence current waveforms and the abrupt changes in negative sequence current. Finally, a 10kV distribution network model is built in MATLAB/Simulink for simulation verification. The results show that the method has good applicability in systems with ungrounded neutral points and can adapt to complex conditions such as grid-forming distributed generator access, noise interference, abrupt and attenuation of grounding resistance. The proposed method overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that rely on phase voltage and are vulnerable to interference from new energy sources, thereby offering a novel solution for fault diagnosis in smart distribution networks."

The main research gap lies in efficiently visualizing and interacting with these large-scale BIM models on the web while maintaining performance and usability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a BIM model lightweighting method that integrates usage-oriented component filtering, multi-level semantic retention, and view-priority-based model slicing and loading. By analyzing component complexity and semantic redundancy, ineffective components are removed and geometric models are compressed. The proposed method tackles both the reduction of model size and the improvement of user interaction efficiency on web platforms, which have been longstanding challenges in this domain. Efficient encoding is achieved through the use of the gLTF format combined with the Draco compression algorithm. A web visualization platform is developed using Vue and Three.js, incorporating dynamic loading and data-binding mechanisms to enable high-performance rendering and interaction of BIM models on the web. The results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces model size and loading time while maintaining semantic integrity. It also offers good cross-device adaptability and supports operations and maintenance. This research provides a feasible technical approach and platform foundation for the online management and intelligent operation of BIM models for pumped storage power stations."

To characterize the I-V characteristics of the PV modules and assess how closely they align with the datasheet values, the study applies both integer-based and fractional models, which are solved using Grünwald-Letnikov (GL) numerical method. A multi-objective optimization technique, utilizing a gradient-based algorithm and the interior-point method, is employed to determine the optimal differentiation order (α) and achieve the best-fit model. This approach ensures high accuracy and adaptability across diverse irradiance conditions, significantly advancing PV performance analysis and optimization. The optimal α is identified by maximizing the Coefficient of Determination ($\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$) and minimizing the Root Mean Square error (RMSE).The results show that, when compared to integer models, the fractional order models greatly enhance accuracy in some circumstances, particularly for irradiance levels of $600 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^{2}$ or less, where RMSE values improved by up to $61.42 \\%$ and $R^{2}$ values can increase significantly. The fractional model showed improved alignment with the PV module datasheet values when optimized differentiation orders between 0.92 and 1.00 were used, highlighting their potential to improve PV module characterization. The application of these results to a wider range of environmental circumstances and PV technologies will be investigated in future research."

Our research into device physics, computer modeling, and material science is motivated by our quest for maximum efficiency. The foundation of our approach is the intentional control of key factors affecting OSC performance. To explore the potential of the organic solar cell design, we made small adjustments to the component materials’ compatibility and thickness. This rigorous method, fueled by state-of-the-art modeling tools and basic principles, signifies a paradigm leap in the optimization arena for OSCs. Our approach comprises a thorough calibration procedure wherein the affinity and thickness of each material are consistently adjusted within a predetermined parameter space. By exploiting the extensive capabilities of the SCAPS program paired with the powerful analytical tools of MATLAB, we conduct a series of simulations that precisely map the complicated relationship between material characteristics and device performance. The principal concentration of our study is on the quantum efficiency spectra, which are key metrics that determine each material’s photovoltaic performance. We give a rich tapestry of insights into the absorption, emission, and charge transport mechanisms impacting OSC performance by carefully studying quantum efficiency spectra vs wavelength for each of the 12 components. Moreover, given with a complete knowledge of material behavior and device physics, we set out to develop the finest feasible organic solar cell via engineering. Through a process of continual refining and careful change of material thicknesses and affinities, we have produced an OSC that is highly stable and efficient. Our results imply large increases in efficiency across all materials. Our finding opens the door to a new age of sustainable energy harvesting and delivers meaningful steps towards the building of next-generation OSCs with the potential to initiate a worldwide revolution in renewable energy."

    "abstract": "Wear is one of the critical factors inducing various mechanical failures, and accurately predicting the wear between friction pairs is essential for equipment health management. As diesel engines progressively develop toward higher explosion pressures and power densities, the working environments of key components such as crankshaft bearings become increasingly harsh, making them more prone to wear issues that compromise engine reliability. Most existing data-driven methods primarily focus on wear modeling using sparse data, yet such approaches exhibit limitations in interpretability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a physics-informed neural network approach by integrating the Archard wear law and typical wear processes as physical constraints into the neural network framework, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating prior physical knowledge improves the overall performance of the neural network. Furthermore, parameter sensitivity analysis reveals that the model maintains behavior consistent with typical wear processes even when applied to unseen data."

In the simple reaction task, cTBS consistently shortened reaction times, whereas iTBS lengthened them, indicating a role for the PPC in response control. TMSEEG revealed that cTBS reduced TEP amplitudes of the P2 and the motor areas, whereas iTBS increased them; cTBS also shortened latencies of the motor areas, whereas iTBS lengthened them. In conclusion, cTBS improved motor performance by decreasing cortical excitability and increasing information processing efficiency, whereas iTBS impairs motor performance by excessively increasing excitability."

    "abstract": "In the world of biometrics, face liveness detection is well known, also called anti-spoofing or liveness checking. It’s a set of methods used to authenticate a user properly by utilizing their biometric properties— for example, a real eye or human face rather than a recreated image of one. This is a key concept for systems to protect their users’ privacy, particularly for sensitive applications such as finance, where financial transactions must be carried out safely, and printed photos, video replays, or masks are typical techniques used among attackers. We could point out several challenges that make it difficult for these systems to achieve robust security, such as variability in lighting conditions, diversity in camera qualities, and differences in facial appearances across populations. In this paper, we propose a novel face-liveness detection method that combines ensemble learning and contrastive learning techniques. This mixed approach aims to improve the solidity and accuracy of detecting these various spoofing attacks. We use the NUAA dataset combined with AI-generated text descriptions of the images. We tested our model on the NUAA dataset, achieving an accuracy of 94.98%. Our method effectively detects printed photo attacks, highlighting the potential of this mixed approach in face anti-spoofing."

Accurate severity classification is crucial for effective treatment and monitoring, particularly in automated healthcare systems. This study proposes an image-based acne severity classification system that utilizes facial acne density as the main feature. The workflow includes image preprocessing, acne detection using the YOLOv8 object detection model, and density-based feature extraction. These features are then classified using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms. To address class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied, improving model generalization. Experimental results show that DT achieves higher performance with 99 % accuracy, while k-NN achieves 97%. Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics further validate the model's robustness. This study confirms the effectiveness of acne density as a feature and demonstrates that integrating object detection with machine learning offers promising results for clinical and telemedicine applications in acne diagnosis and personalized treatment planning."

Through a high-fidelity driving simulation experiment, the EEG and EMG data of 16 drivers (20-30 years old and 60-70 years old groups) were collected in the simulated environment, and features were extracted using adaptive power spectral density (APSD) and conventional spatial pattern (CSP). The experimental results show that the power in the theta- and beta-wave bands is significantly higher in the older group than in the younger group, reflecting a larger cognitive load and longer reaction time; EMG analysis further reveals that the older group has a delayed peak activation (250-270ms) and a higher activation intensity, whereas the younger group responds more quickly (100-115ms). This method provides technical support and neurophysiological basis for the design of intelligent driving systems, especially considering the effect of age differences."

Compared to vision-based or wearable systems, CSI-based HAR offers the advantages of low cost, non-intrusiveness, and the ability to leverage existing wireless infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a practical and cost-effective HAR framework that utilizes commercial ESP32 Wi-Fi modules to capture CSI data and a deep neural network (DNN) for activity classification. Our system demonstrates the feasibility of using low-cost embedded devices to collect meaningful CSI patterns, enabling activity recognition without the need for expensive routers or specialized hardware. We design and implement an end-to-end processing pipeline, starting with a synchronized data acquisition system that collects multilink CSI signals from multiple ESP32 modules, along with video recordings for ground-truth labeling. The collected data is used to train a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) for real-time human activity recognition in indoor environments. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves an average accuracy of 94.7% on our self-collected dataset, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. This demonstrates the feasibility of deploying accessible, privacy-preserving smart sensing applications using low-cost Wi-Fi hardware."

This algorithm utilizes Logistic chaotic mapping to initialize the particle population, enhancing population diversity to avoid search blind spots. In addition, an adaptive inertia weight mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the global search capability and convergence speed of the PSO. When power fluctuations tend to stabilize, the algorithm switches to the Firefly Algorithm for refined local search. Simulation results under various irradiance conditions demonstrate that compared with standard PSO and FA algorithms, the improved PSO-FA algorithm can track the maximum power point of PV systems more quickly and accurately under complex shading scenarios."

To address this gap, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework is introduced to identify atypical daily glucose patterns without the need for labeled data. The approach encodes each day’s CGM profile as a high-dimensional vector, applies UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and uses DBSCAN to detect outliers. Applied to a two-month dataset from a single individual, the method revealed anomalies aligned with unlogged lifestyle changes. One event was independently confirmed through clinical records, underscoring the potential of CGM for passive, personalized monitoring and broader health tracking."

The Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Technology Mapping (TM) is a fundamental problem in EDA that transforms a technology independent Boolean representation of a circuit into a technology-dependent representation using standard cells. The academic logic synthesis tool ABC represents the input circuit as And Inverter Graph (AIG) and use a cut-based Boolean matching algorithm for TM. However, this process has high computational overhead due to the Boolean matching across an exponentially large number of cuts. Machine Learning (ML) can provide faster, improved solutions through learning. In this regard, we have proposed LEAP: a novel ML-based cut classifier and a delay predictor, exposing a few high-quality cuts to the mapper. LEAP reduces the number of cuts by 51% compared to the ABC, resulting in a 2% improvement in delay without incurring any area penalty."

    "abstract": "Transition zones in coastal wetlands are prone to frequent semantic changes due to dynamic ecological processes such as tidal fluctuations, seasonal changes, and runoff dynamics. However, existing semantic change detection (SCD) methods generally lack explicit modeling and a structured representation of such regions, making it difficult to accurately locate and identify semantic changes within them. To address this issue, TDNet is proposed for SCD in coastal wetlands. First, a transition zone detection branch is added to identify semantically sensitive regions and guide the network to focus on change-prone areas. Then, a transition zone driven module (TZDM) temporally concatenates the initial segmentation features (ISFs) and transition zone features (TZFs) from the bi-temporal inputs into a four-frame sequence, processes it with a 3D convolutional structure to model spatiotemporal evolution in transition zones , and ultimately generates the final segmentation features (FSFs). Additionally, a transition zone indicator (TZI) is employed to generate pixel-level transition labels that provide spatial supervision, further improving the model’s ability to distinguish change-prone regions. Experimental results demonstrate that TDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in addressing the challenge of SCD within transition zones."

    "abstract": "Edge computing provides low-latency computational services for task offloading in vehicular networks. However, challenges such as dynamic transmission rates, resource limitations, and information-sharing constraints impede efficient offloading. Few studies address these issues concurrently in designing dynamic offloading strategies, often resulting in sub optimal system utility. This paper aims to achieve efficient vehicular task offloading via an idleness-aware edge server (ES) from a game theory perspective. We propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) prediction model with an attention mechanism to guide vehicles to the nearest idle ES. The offloading decision process is modeled as a stochastic game, proving the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE). Additionally, we model it as a multi agent partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to account for limited information access among vehicles. To solve the POMDP and achieve near-optimal NE, we introduce a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Task Offloading (MATO) algorithm, combining a Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and an Advantageous Actor-Critic (A2C) framework. The DNC's external memory stores structured representations of past information, enabling deeper exploration of the strategy space. Adjusting the reward representation enhances training efficiency. Experimental results driven by real-world datasets demonstrate that MATO effectively improves the computing offloading utility while increasing the convergence speed compared to existing schemes."

This paper presents a neutral steering chassis coordination control scheme to extend the lateral motion limits of Dual-Motor All-Wheel-Drive Electric Vehicles (DMAWD EVs). First, an optimization model is developed using the tire friction ellipse to determine the maximum lateral force. It is demonstrated that a vehicle can fully exploit its lateral motion limits under neutral steering. Then a driving torque allocation method for the front and rear axles and a sliding mode control method for the electro-hydraulic composite anti-lock braking system are designed to fulfill the driver's driving intentions under normal driving conditions. In extreme driving conditions, a torque vectoring control strategy is proposed to coordinate the motors' driving torques and the hydraulic braking forces, while a Smith predictor-based control scheme is introduced to enhance the hydraulic braking responsiveness. Furthermore, a coordinated pitch and roll attitude controller is developed to maintain neutral steering. Finally, the proposed control scheme is verified through comprehensive testing on a Hardware-in-the-Loop platform. Results indicate that the maximum lateral acceleration increases by 18.14% under the open-loop sine steering scenario. The proposed control scheme renders DMAWD EVs to have comparable performance with four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles."

    "abstract": "Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, driven by rapid urbanization and increased Impervious Surface Areas (ISA) density, is a significant challenge to sustainable urban development and climate resilience. A robust understanding of the relationship between ISA density and Land Surface Temperature (LST) is critical for mitigating UHI effects. A key component in UHI analysis is the accurate extraction of UHI zones, which depends on the chosen threshold values. Traditional approaches often rely on static methods to identify UHI thresholds and simple regression models, which may not fully capture the complex, nonlinear interactions between ISA density and LST. Therefore, this study introduces a hybrid optimization model that integrates Genetic Algorithm-Simulated Annealing with Generalized Additive Models to assess the impact of ISA density on LST and thus define UHI thresholds. The model is applied to Algiers (2012–2021) and Taranto (2000–2014) cities using ASTER data. A local morphological density analysis was employed to quantify ISA and green space densities. Findings reveal a distinct positive nonlinear relationship between the ISA density and LST, identifying critical thresholds beyond which temperature escalates sharply. UHI zones exhibited significantly higher mean LST values, reaching 42.11°C in Taranto and 38.38°C in Algiers. Moreover, green space density was found to mitigate LST, reinforcing the pivotal role of vegetation in urban climate regulation. The findings of this adaptive modeling framework highlight the necessity of sustainable urban planning and the potential of data-driven approaches for refining climate adaptation strategies."

Samples of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyether-etherketone (PEEK) were irradiated with X-rays, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gamma $</tex-math> </inline-formula>-rays, or electrons at total ionizing dose (TID) of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times 10^{2}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times 10^{3}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, or <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times 10^{4}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> Gy, respectively. Charge was then injected in each sample with an 80-keV monoenergetic electron beam. The resulting charge distributions and charge transport properties were probed via pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) measurements. Samples were measured in a parallel plate capacitor configuration where they were first grounded, a dc bias was applied, and then grounded again. Thermal and structural properties were measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show at least three distinct phases of charge transport characteristics in PTFE, while PEEK showed no substantial changes at these TID. Observable differences in the DSC measurements were apparent for both PTFE and PEEK indicating enhanced crystallization with aging. The study suggests that dose rate may be the dominant factor as opposed to radiation type for aging in polymers."

    "abstract": "To address the dynamic changes of low-voltage station area topology caused by distributed photovoltaic (PV) integration and the challenges of multi-source data fusion, a novel health assessment method based on Graph Attention Networks (GAT) is proposed. Traditional assessment methods often fail to adapt to complex dynamic scenarios due to their reliance on static weights and fixed topology assumptions. In this paper, an evaluation system with eight core indicators is developed, with initial weights determined through a combination of subjective and objective weighting methods. A two-layer GAT structure is utilized to extract voltage difference features and dynamically capture node correlations for high- precision topology identification. The node attention coefficients from the GAT are further used to compute topology sensitivity, which serves as the basis for dynamic weight adjustment. Experimental results show that the proposed framework of \"topology identification - weight adjustment - health assessment\" enhances assessment differentiation through dynamic weighting, providing accurate decision-making support for preventive maintenance and differentiated upgrades of PV station areas."

    "abstract": "Flight data anomaly detection (AD) is vital for maintaining the flight safety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the complex spatiotemporal correlation and the interference of random noise in flight data, coupled with the high cost associated with labeling anomaly data, present significant challenges to the accuracy of AD models. This study proposes an attention-based encoder-decoder hybrid network with adaptive thresholds (AEDHN-AT) method for critical parameter AD of UAV flight data. First, a reconstruction model based on AEDHN is designed. This model first utilizes bi-directional long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (BiLSTM-1D CNN) as the feature extractor to achieve multi-level feature extraction from UAV flight data. Building upon this, an attention mechanism is introduced to guide the feature extractor in selectively learning crucial information and features. Second, a dynamic threshold calculation method based on support vector regression (SVR) with residual smoothing is proposed to obtain dynamic thresholds. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through extensive experiments on real UAV flight data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior AD performance compared to the baseline methods."

    "abstract": "The vibration patterns resulting from faults and defects in rotating machinery often exhibit distinct periodic characteristics, which serve as a critical foundation for fault diagnosis. However, the vibration signals of rotating machinery are frequently disturbed by periodic vibration noise, leading to substantial interference with the signals from the tested components and thereby compromising the efficacy of fault diagnosis methods. In this study, a comprehensive method named Gini-based Periodic Pulse Signal Extraction (GPPSE) is proposed to efficiently extract periodic pulse signals associated with rolling bearing faults in the presence of periodic noise interference. This approach can determine the optimal number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) method based on Gini Index of Square Envelope (GISE). And it introduces a novel fault periodic pulse evaluation index, termed the G-C index, based on GISE and correlation analysis. By integrating the G-C index, VMD, and Maximum Second-order Cyclostationarity Blind Deconvolution (CYCBD), the proposed comprehensive method can effectively isolate fault periodic pulse components from rolling bearing fault signals contaminated with periodic noise. Experimental setups are designed to gather fault data from hydraulic pump rolling bearings under real-world engineering conditions, and subsequent performance verification experiments were conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Bearings, serving as the pivotal elements within industrial machinery, often operate under prolonged high loads, which makes them susceptible to failures. Given these circumstances, health monitoring and fault diagnosis become vital components for ensuring operational safety. This paper first reviews and summarizes mainstream traditional fault diagnosis approaches in the domains of signal processing, physical modelling, and data-driven methods, and highlights their inherent limitations. The study then directs its attention to multi-source data fusion techniques, with special consideration given to three hierarchical fusion paradigms: data-level, feature-level, and decision-level. The advantages of these approaches are demonstrated through typical application cases such as vibration signal stacking and time–frequency image fusion. The analysis of compound bearing fault diagnosis methods categorizes modern multi-source data fusion techniques into three key innovations: synergistic data combination, deep learning-based feature mining, and real-time weight recalibration, each driven by different core principles. A systematic comparison is presented to explore the priorities, usage contexts, and strengths and weaknesses of each methodology. The next step in multi-source data fusion-based bearing fault diagnosis research involves examining the mechanisms of co-occurring fault cooperation, lightweight architecture design, interpretable model development, and distributed processing techniques, aiming to resolve the constraints of conventional techniques and elevate the accuracy and trustworthiness of bearing fault identification processes."

    "abstract": "In many practical classification problems, it is not enough to derive a decision rule; one must also understand the underlying data structure to enable proper interpretation and actionable recommendations. This paper proposes a novel method based on an ensemble of linear separators. Traditional committee methods – such as unanimity, majority, and seniority – have been applied to two-class problems. To reduce the number of committee members and to allow more general decision logic, we extend these ideas and propose a model that partitions the feature space using K hyperplanes with binary-weighted votes: 1, 2, 4, …, 2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K–1</sup>. Each region is assigned a unique identifier corresponding to the sum of the voting weights of the hyperplanes that classify it positively. If the hyperplanes can be positioned so that each region contains points of only one class, the classification problem is solved; otherwise, the model minimizes misclassification errors. Such ensemble of linear separators provides a single model or framework that can handle both binary and multiclass classification with minimal errors. We present the complete mathematical formulation and demonstrate its application on real and synthetic datasets."

    "abstract": "Bone metastasis is a common and serious complication in cancer patients, often affecting treatment decisions and prognosis. Whole-Body Bone Scan (WBBS) is widely used for detecting skeletal metastases due to its high sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. However, manual interpretation of WBBS images is time-consuming and prone to diagnostic errors. This study aims to develop an automated bone metastasis hotspot detection system using the latest version of the You Only Look Once model, YOLOv11, and the publicly available BS80 K dataset. The dataset consists of 3,247 pairs of anterior and posterior bone scan images, each annotated with bounding boxes and labels for abnormal regions. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, two object detection models-YOLOv11 and Faster R-CNN-were trained using the same hyperparameter configuration and evaluated using mean Average Precision at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP50) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP50-95). The results demonstrate that YOLOv11 outperforms Faster R-CNN in both accuracy and inference speed, the best YOLOv11 model (yolov11s, learning rate 0.01) achieved mAP50 of 0.564 and mAP50-95 of 0.236, with a total training time of 5.811 hours and an average inference time of 3.6 ms per image. In contrast, Faster R-CNN model (ResNet50 backbone, learning rate 0.0001) achieved mAP50 of 0.389 and mAP50-95 of 0.156, with total training time of 10.782 hours and an average inference time of 37.1 ms per image. These findings indicate that YOLOv11 has strong potential for clinical application in automatic WBBS analysis, offering improvements in diagnostic consistency and reducing clinician workload."

    "abstract": "In condition monitoring of critical transportation components such as bearings, abnormal examples are extremely scarce or entirely absent, rendering conventional supervised diagnostic techniques impractical. To overcome this challenge, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that fuses Generative Flow model with Generative Adversarial Network, which is termed Glow-GAN. First, the Glow model performs invertible flow transformations and maximum likelihood estimation on extensive time-frequency matrices derived exclusively from data under healthy operation, thereby accurately modeling the healthy data distribution. A dedicated discriminator is then introduced for adversarial training, in which binary cross-entropy loss guides the model to better capture fine-grained data details. During inference, an anomaly score is computed by combining the reconstruction error with the negative log-likelihood; significant deviations from the healthy baseline trigger a fault alarm. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed Glow-GAN framework effectively separates healthy and anomalous data, enabling early bearing-fault detection. Compared to existing methods or pure GAN architectures, the proposed approach leverages the rigorous probabilistic foundations of flow models alongside the detail-enhancing benefits of adversarial training, yielding stable convergence and superior condition monitoring."

    "abstract": "This study presents a post-thesis evaluation of object detection models for greenhouse automation, extending previous efforts that applied YOLOv8n to classify tomato ripeness stages in Thai agricultural settings. The original system integrated drone-based image acquisition with IoT-driven irrigation control, demonstrating that compact AI models can operate effectively even in resource-limited agricultural environments. However, its evaluation relied primarily on conventional metrics, such as mAP@50 and precision, which may overlook nuanced model behavior in real-world conditions. To address this gap, we introduce the Unified Detection Score (UDS) - a composite metric designed to provide a holistic and interpretable measure of model quality. Using the re-annotated tomato ripeness dataset from the original research (“Precision Agriculture in Thailand: Merging Drone-Assisted Object Recognition with IoT,” 2024), this study compares five YOLOv12 variants (n, s, m, l, x) against YOLOv8n and YOLOv5. Among them, YOLOv12n achieved the highest UDS of 93.3, outperforming YOLOv8n (91.9) and YOLOv5 (82.7), while maintaining a compact model size of 5.4 MB and a fast-training time of 0.52 hours. Larger YOLOv12 variants offered no significant performance advantage; in fact, YOLOv12x, despite its scale, underperformed with a UDS of 90.9 and a size of 119.5 MB. Further experiments confirmed that the original YOLOv8n training configuration (50 epochs, batch size 8) remains optimal for YOLOv12n, with extended training routines yielding negligible gains. Optimizer screening validated AdamW as the most effective choice, and hyperparameter tuning revealed that a decay of 0.0009 and a momentum of 0.975 offer the best balance of precision and stability. These findings highlight YOLOv12n as a practical and efficient successor to YOLOv8n for greenhouse automation tasks. By introducing the UDS framework and offering detailed comparisons across multiple architectures, this study contributes both a novel evaluation methodology and practical insights to help advance scalable, precision agriculture solutions."

    "abstract": "Composite joints are widely used in industrial fields due to their advantages, such as high efficiency and low weight. However, stress concentration at the adhesive interfaces often leads to potential failure risks. To address the challenges of damage monitoring in bonded joints, this study proposes a change point detection algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, integrated with acoustic emission (AE) techniques. Tensile tests were conducted on single-lap joints with various adhesive lengths, and the evolution of AE signal characteristic parameters under load was collected and analyzed. The study found that traditional AE indicators, such as cumulative energy, cumulative counts and the Sentry function, are susceptible to noise interference and exhibit limited capability in accurately correlating with different damage stages. In contrast, the proposed probabilistic Monte Carlo-based approach effectively captures the transitions of fracture mechanisms within the AE time series. By simulating potential stage transitions under complex probability distributions, the proposed algorithm enables quantitative identification of damage initiation and propagation stages, and successfully distinguishes the damage states of specimens with different adhesive lengths. Results from the experiments confirm that this method overcomes the limitations of traditional qualitative analyses, providing a highly sensitive and quantitative tool for load-bearing capacity assessment and health monitoring of bonded structures. This work offers significant contributions to improving the reliability of structural integrity evaluations."

    "abstract": "The actual operating conditions of a gearbox are complex, and it is impossible to comprehensively diagnose faults relying solely on information from a single source. To address the above - mentioned problems, a gearbox fault diagnosis model based on multi - source information fusion is proposed. The original vibration signal is converted into a one - dimensional frequency - domain signal and a two - dimensional time - frequency diagram through the Fast Fourier Transform and the Continuous Wavelet Transform. The regularization technique is adopted to extract the operating condition data from the operating condition text information. Transformer, ViT(Vision Transformer), and CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) are used to perform feature learning on the above three types of information respectively, and then the features are spliced. The spliced features are input into the classification head to achieve fault identification of different operating conditions of the gearbox. In this paper, the gearbox dataset of Southeast University is used to verify the feasibility of the model, and the average fault identification rate for different operating conditions reaches 99.4%. In addition, through comparative ablation experiments, the noise - resistance and superiority of the model are demonstrated. The experimental results show that the gearbox fault diagnosis model based on multi - source information fusion can achieve fault diagnosis of different operating conditions of the gearbox."

By classifying the impacts on personnel safety, task availability, and maintenance costs, failure consequence models are established, including a safety model, a task model, and an economic model. Furthermore, maintenance logic decisions are made based on the failure consequence model to determine logical decision-making models for different maintenance scenarios, and to calculate the optimal maintenance level and timing for the equipment.

    "abstract": "A trend for developing synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs)-based drive systems is observed in the industry due to their simple and robust construction, with no rare earth elements (REE). These machines offer high efficiency and are based on easily available materials. Designing an energy-efficient control strategy is non-trivial because of the magnetic saturation phenomenon in the iron-based rotor. Outstanding dynamic drive performance can be achieved by applying a constrained full-state feedback controller (SFC). However, this structure cannot employ classical torque maximization strategies, leading to poor efficiency. Thus, a customized torque maximization strategy has to be designed for SFC-based angular velocity control systems to enable energy-efficient operation. An original torque maximization strategy for a SynRM drive is proposed for the SFC structure. Maximum torque operation is ensured by applying a customized torque maximization unit (TMU) with maximum torque per Ampere (MTPA) and field weakening (FW) operation. MTPA is based on a trajectory based on precalculated machine models applied using an artificial neural network trained offline, while FW is based on a machine parameter-free approach with current phase shifting (CPS). The robustness of the CPS was analytically confirmed based on a small-signal analysis. The experimental results obtained confirm energy-efficient, and stable operation of the system for both the MTPA and the FW operations. The proposed SFC-TMU structure is compared to a state-of-the-art lookup table (LUT)-based field-oriented control (FOC) cascade control structure (CCS). The given torque maximization trajectory is properly tracked and reveals superior efficiency, outperforming a classical LUT-based FOC-CCS strategy."

Thirty-six athletes (13 females (F), 23 males (M)) are assessed: 22 sprinters (10F, 12M) and 14 long-distance runners (3F, 11M). BIA measurements are taken under standardized conditions. Initial assessments show that both sexes fall within normal fat mass (FM) ranges: M average 19.32%, F 25.65%. FM is higher in females than in males, and lower in long-distance runners than in sprinters. After a three-month training period—sprinters follow high-intensity, low-volume workouts with biweekly strength sessions; long-distance runners emphasize endurance and weekly strength training—a second assessment reveals improved body composition and hydration in both groups. Long-distance runners improve their body composition between the two tests and show, on average, the best overall body composition values. However, sprinters exhibit the highest percentage improvements, as they begin with less favorable values and respond strongly to the training stimulus. Notably, the most trained female athletes display excellent values, in some cases comparable to those of their moderately trained male counterparts."

A hybrid pulsed-continuous wave pumping scheme is employed in this cavity to generate relaxation oscillation gain, which subsequently modulates the injected mode-locked pulses into a burst mode through gain-switching effect. The characteristics of the generated burst can be adjusted conveniently by varying the pump parameters. In order to investigate the frequency dynamical behaviors in this method, we experimentally record the real-time spectra output from the fiber ring cavity by means of the dispersive Fourier transform technique. During the initial ring-down period, incomplete gain competition deteriorates the output burst spectrum upon the arrival of subsequent gain. Optimal increase of the pump-signal delay establishes resonant-frequency dominance in gain competition, which yields spectrally stable burst operation. The removal of the requirement for active modulators in this scheme yields a compact burst laser with greater robustness and lower cost, thereby facilitating its practical application."

    "abstract": "LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) has been widely used in robotics due to its high accuracy. However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors–akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions."

Despite advancements in detection methods, most topology-based approaches insufficiently account for the heterogeneity of neighborhood preferences and lack a systematic theoretical foundation, relying instead on intuition and experience. Here, we propose a theoretical framework for detecting social bots utilizing heterogeneous motifs based on the Naïve Bayes model. Specifically, we refine homogeneous motifs into heterogeneous ones by incorporating node-label information, effectively capturing the heterogeneity of neighborhood preferences. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the contribution of different node pairs within heterogeneous motifs to the likelihood of a node being identified as a social bot. Furthermore, we mathematically quantify the maximum capability of each heterogeneous motif, enabling the estimation of its potential benefits. Comprehensive evaluations on four large, publicly available benchmarks confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving superior performance across five evaluation metrics. Moreover, our results reveal that selecting motifs with the highest capability achieves detection performance comparable to using all heterogeneous motifs. Overall, our framework offers an effective and theoretically grounded solution for social bot detection, significantly enhancing cybersecurity measures in social networks."

While existing reconstruction methods have shown promise, they often succeed only in small-baseline settings and struggle with larger disparities or real-time efficiency. Depth-based approaches are prone to artifacts due to imperfect depth estimates, while non-depth-based methods lack geometric accuracy, fail in occluded or textureless regions, and are typically computationally intensive. In this work, we provide a more effective disentanglement of spatial, angular, and epipolar representations for light field reconstruction. Through dedicated feature extractors and a residual-in-residual architecture enhanced with channel attention, our framework efficiently captures subpixel details and long-range dependencies while adaptively emphasizing the most informative cues. Rigorous ablation studies further highlight the critical role of epipolar feature interactions—an aspect previously overlooked in the literature. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across small-and large-baseline scenarios, delivering higher reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive efficiency."

To provide high-quality services, many existing studies show that dispersed computing has significant advantages in reducing latency and improving efficiency. However, existing work has clearly overlooked the dynamicity of vehicular networks and the latency impact caused by the heterogeneous computing capabilities of adjacent idle devices. In this article, we propose a new task offloading scheme based on dispersed computing to reduce overall task time. Specifically: 1) we model the minimization of total task execution time for multiple ICVs in a dispersed device-assisted network, comprehensively considering task computation time, transmission time, and waiting time; 2) an ICV scheduling algorithm based on swap matching is proposed to fully satisfy the quality of service requirements of ICV. Then, a Lagrange dual-based method is proposed to achieve computing resource allocation; 3) the experiments are conducted on real-world datasets. Compared to baseline heuristic schemes, our algorithm can effectively reduce the total execution time by an average of 4.8% to 31.8%. In special scenarios, the total execution time is reduced by an average of 10.7%.

While traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms exhibit promise for VVC, they often require extensive computational resources to handle such a high-dimensional problem. As a potential solution, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithms integrate the computational capabilities of quantum computing into the DRL framework. However, existing QRL algorithms struggle with complex VVC problems due to the limitations of current quantum hardware. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an innovative QRL algorithm featuring an end-to-end architecture that integrates a classical autoencoder, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), and classical post-processing layers. This design efficiently compresses high-dimensional grid states, enabling VQCs to leverage quantum advantages while producing multiple control device outputs, specifically tailored for VVC tasks. Numerical studies on three representative distribution systems verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed QRL algorithm, and demonstrate its enhanced performance over classical approaches with only approximately 1% of the parameters. Additionally, the robustness of our developed algorithm is validated through noisy quantum environments."

    "abstract": "Robust and accurate localization technologies are crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots. Precisely perceiving the 3D environment and its semantic attributes in the real world greatly enhances the ability of these systems to perform localization tasks effectively. This paper proposes GS-Loc, the first visual relocalization framework based on a vision foundation model that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a map representation. GS-Loc leverages the powerful visual feature extraction capabilities of a vision foundation model as a Global Locator, performing global descriptor matching between query images and a reference image database. This enables each query image to be matched with the most optimal candidate image in the map and an initial pose within the map. Leveraging the high-dimensional feature embeddings extracted by vision foundation models, we propose the Foundation Feature-Consistent Matcher (FFC-Matcher), which establishes a feature similarity filtering mechanism to extract geometrically consistent feature subsets from high-quality images and depth maps rendered by the 3DGS model, thereby enabling pose refinement through 2D-3D feature matching. To enhance the efficiency of GS-Loc, we introduce sparsification of the 3DGS model by retaining only the Gaussians that contain relevant feature information. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI360 and ROBOTCAR datasets show that even with a model size reduced by approximately 50%, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods."

    "abstract": "Phantom track jamming is an important branch of radar deception jamming. Research on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning for phantom track generation (PTG) is challenged by the high-dimensional solution space, non-differentiable objective function, and complex constraints. Existing PTG methods do not incorporate electromagnetic constraints, employ online one-step optimization, and can only generate limited types of phantom tracks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based PTG method. In this paper, we formulate PTG as a Markov decision process, incorporate the electromagnetic constraints, and develop the first offline multi-step optimization method for PTG. Additionally, a state data preprocessing technique is introduced to achieve translation and scaling invariance of scenario features, significantly reducing the learning cost while enhancing policy generalization capability. Three representative scenarios are used to visually demonstrate the superiority of the DRL-based PTG method. Furthermore, numerous experiments are conducted to statistically validate the competitiveness of the proposed method in terms of computational speed and phantom track completeness."

    "abstract": "Connected health integrates sensors, mobile devices, and information technology to realize the real-time collection and transmission of medical data, providing patients with more personalized and efficient medical services. In this context, medical image segmentation technology plays a vital role as a key digital medicine tool in connected health. However, its effective deployment across diverse clinical settings and data sources remains challenging due to inherent variations in imaging modalities, patient demographics, and device characteristics. Currently, connected health requires highly efficient AI models for real-world medical applications. The versatility of the model across diverse environments is of great significance. Domain Generalization (DG) has emerged as a crucial solution to address these challenges of connected health. Previous work focuses on the domain similarity calculation on the final layer output of the backbone model, which ignores the impact of the multi-scale features. In this paper, we proposed a Domain Pyramid Attention Network (DPANet), which aims to transfer knowledge from source domains to unseen domains for medical image segmentation at a multi-scale level. The overarching goal is to enhance the efficiency of connected health systems through this innovative knowledge transfer mechanism. DPANet is capable of learning multi-scale similarity between two kinds of domains through a Domain Similarity Pyramid Attention Module (DSPAM). We also designed Domain Prototypes (DP), which can enhance the flexibility of the knowledge pre-extracted from source domains for better transferability. A simple fusion method is adopted to merge the multi-scale features for the final segmentation prediction. DPANet is evaluated on Brain Tumor segmentation and Retina Fundus segmentation tasks, achieving an average Dice improvement of 1.14% and 0.98% on these two tasks, respectively."

    "abstract": "Oil extraction is a crucial component of the petroleum industry, and oil extractors play a key role in this process. However, the operation and maintenance of oil extractors face numerous challenges such as the dispersed distribution of equipment across vast oil fields and the frequent occurrence of various mechanical faults. These issues not only reduce operational efficiency, but also increase maintenance costs and downtime. In addition, with the increasing complexity and diversity of faults, traditional manual identification methods are becoming inadequate to meet the growing demands of the industry. Manual approaches are often time-consuming, error-prone, and require experienced personnel, which limits their scalability and effectiveness in large-scale operations. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach for fault diagnosis in oil extraction equipment. Firstly, the paper collects a multi-class dataset, which contains more than 3k images and 8 different types of faults. Secondly, a fault diagnosis model is introduced, which incorporates a series of attention modules to enhance feature extraction and improve the accuracy of the fault diagnosis. Experimental comparisons confirm that the proposed method substantially enhances classification performance. This method shows potential for practical applications, offering a reliable solution for fault diagnosis in the oil extraction industry."

    "abstract": "Customer activation in financial services necessitates proactive strategies to anticipate client needs during pivotal moments. Traditional methods often fail to differentiate between routine transactions and those influenced by life events or seasonal trends, resulting in missed engagement opportunities. This study proposes a new two-block framework that combines K-means clustering (for fixed periods like holidays) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) (for dynamic life events like home purchases). By segmenting customers into behaviorally coherent clusters and detecting transactional anomalies, this framework links the gap between raw data and actionable insights. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying high-engagement customer groups and identifying life moments, enabling institutions to align services with both predictable and unpredictable needs. The hybrid model achieved 89.7% precision and 85.3% recall (F1-score=87.4%), outperforming single-model baselines by 20-28% in F1 score. Practical deployments show a 12% reduction in customer churn and a 15% increase in mortgage conversion rates through personalized offers. The frame work’s SHAP-driven interpretability enables transparent decision-making while addressing regulatory concerns"

A tailored control model is constructed for the VSG inverter, incorporating active and reactive power control loops and targeting key parameters such as damping factor, inertia constant, voltage gain, and droop coefficient. The proposed method enhances global search and avoids local optima through adaptive parameter adjustment and improved initialization strategies. Simulation results, conducted on a MATLAB-based platform, demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the relative error of key parameters (e.g., damping factor to 3.69%, inertia constant to 5.3%) and significantly lowers the RMSE compared to traditional PSO methods. The algorithm exhibits robust performance under nonlinear and dynamic load disturbances, confirming its engineering applicability and superiority in complex operational environments."

However, existing algorithms neglect the high-dimensional, multi-modal, and dynamically coupled properties of those data, leading to low accuracy and poor interpretability. To solve this issue, we propose an anomaly detection method using a multi-scale dual-stream heterogeneous graph attention network (MDHAN). First, a multi-scale feature extraction module is designed to accurately capture the local details and global trends of the data through different convolutional kernels. Second, the spatial-temporal graph attention feature extraction module is constructed to deeply excavate the heterogeneous relationship and dynamic temporal dependence among features. Finally, a joint \"reconstruction + prediction\" optimization objective is proposed to generate a comprehensive and integrated anomaly score. The experimental results show that MDHAN can significantly reduce the false negative rate and false positive rate. It provides an efficient and interpretable anomaly detection paradigm for the autonomous operation and maintenance of cloud service systems. And it promotes the development of reliability assurance technology for space-based information networks."

    "abstract": "The size distribution of abrasive particles produced by wear on rotating parts reflects the different wear stages of the equipment, and there is a correlation between the number of abrasive particles in different sizes. On-line oil abrasive sensors can collect the size and number of abrasive particles in the lubricating fluid, but there is a lack of methods to directly use this data for failure warning. For the failure warning of equipment rotating parts, the article constructs a model of the relationship between the number of abrasive particles in different size intervals based on the theory of multiple nonlinear regression, which can be used to estimate the number of abrasive particles in different size intervals and realize the failure warning of the equipment. Firstly, we need to carry out full-life experiments of target parts on the equipment and collect the abrasive grain data; secondly, we verify the correlation of the abrasive particles data between different sizes, and establish a model of the quantity relationship between abrasive particles through the multivariate nonlinear regression theory; finally, we use the model to predict the number of abrasive particles, and search for the time point when large abrasive particles, which are more threatening to the equipment, appear in large quantities, which is the theoretical failure warning point of the equipment. The experimental results show that the coefficient of determination R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of the multivariate nonlinear regression model established by this method can reach 91.55%, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 1.9944, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.702. The failure warning is made 12.5h ahead of time, which is better than that of the simple univariate nonlinear regression model in judging the time when the number of abrasive particles rises sharply, and the model can realize the failure warning of large abrasive particles by using the number of medium-small abrasive particles. In addition, the accuracy and versatility of the method were further verified on other devices, and the warning of unexpected failures was made 5.5h in advance, which is of practical value."

The method estimates energy depletion from the OCV curve and calculates equivalent short circuit current and resistance. Validation is performed through constant current discharge tests, which can simulate OCV profiles during thermal abuse by adjusting density of constant current discharging, and the density of discharging current can represent the value of equivalent short circuit current. Experimental results show that short circuit resistance decreases significantly as temperature increases, indicating more severe faults. The proposed method offers a practical tool for quantifying short circuit severity and contributes to improving battery safety analysis."

These models combine the spatial feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the contextual understanding of Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU). A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the model's hyperparameters and enhance overall performance. Sentiments are categorized into positive, neutral, and negative classes. The model's effectiveness is measured using the F1score as the primary evaluation metric. Experimental results show that the GA-optimized BiGRU-CNN model achieves the best performance, reaching an F1-score of 85.70 % in the final scenario. These findings confirm the model's effectiveness in sentiment classification of HIV/AIDS-related Twitter data and highlight its potential to support public health communication strategies."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a general model of rotor support misalignment fault is proposed. The equivalent coupling model parameters are calculated by using the radial stiffness and angular stiffness of the coupling, and the mechanical model of the coupling is established which has left and right half couplings and multiple connecting pairs connected to each other. The total radial stiffness and angular stiffness of the equivalent coupling are equivalent to the actual coupling. And the model parameters of the equivalent coupling are calculated according to the stiffness of the actual coupling. Then the stiffness difference and the nonlinear stiffness problem, the excitation force model of the angle misalignment fault of the coupling is established according to the uneven distribution of the circumferential position of the connection pair. In addition, the rotor-support coupling dynamic model with the rotor bearing misalignment fault is established. The vibration response characteristics of the rotor under the misalignment fault are analyzed by numerical simulation. The generation mechanism of characteristic frequency of misalignment fault is revealed. Finally,the test of rotor support misalignment fault under various misalignment conditions at characteristic speed is completed. And the test results verify the correctness of the rotor support misalignment fault model proposed in this paper."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of China's national strategic goals and supporting policies for carbon peak and carbon neutrality, For wind power enterprises, reducing actual operating costs has become a top priority. The main bearing's unexpected damage in Semi-Direct Drive Wind Turbines (SDDWT) due to delayed maintenance can affect the overall machine stability, even causing prolonged shutdowns. Excessive maintenance, however, also leads to a significant increase in operation and maintenance costs. High-precision remaining useful life (RUL) prediction for main bearings can effectively reduce the operation costs of SDDWT, but RUL research on large rotating machinery like SDDWT main bearings still faces critical challenges: unclear performance degradation mechanisms, limited valuable data samples, and severe lack of data labeling.To address the above issues, this paper takes the main bearings of SDDWTs as the research object. By integrating model-based Digital Twin technology with data-driven domain adaptation methods, it conducts studies on: (1) the analysis of performance degradation mechanisms for main bearings; (2) the theoretical methodology of model-data fusion for RUL prediction."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology has experienced rapid growth and has been widely adopted across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and energy. However, blockchain platforms remain vulnerable to a broad range of cyberattacks, particularly those aimed at exploiting transactions and smart contracts (SCs) to steal digital assets or compromise system integrity. To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective framework for detecting cyberattacks within blockchain systems. Our framework begins with a preprocessing tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform key features of blockchain transactions into image representations. These images are then analyzed through vision-based analysis using Vision Transformers (ViT), a recent advancement in computer vision known for its superior ability to capture complex patterns and semantic relationships. By integrating NLP-based preprocessing with vision-based learning, our framework can detect a wide variety of attack types. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy (achieving 99.5%) and robustness in cyberattack detection for blockchain transactions and SCs."

However, this downsizing leads to voltage instability due to the negative incremental impedance introduced by constant power loads. This paper proposes a voltage stabilization method for low-capacitance DC-link systems using Modulated Model Predictive Control (M2PC) integrated with current injection-based active damping. The control scheme incorporates a discrete-time prediction model for the DC-link voltage and compensates predicted voltage deviations by dynamically modifying the current reference. Compared to conventional PI-based current injection methods, the proposed approach offers superior damping performance and reduced voltage ripple. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the M2PC architecture in improving stability and dynamic performance in low-capacitance drive applications."

The front-end CNN-BiGRU module extracts local fluctuation features and bidirectional temporal dependencies, while the back-end Autoformer architecture captures long-term periodic patterns. Experiments conducted on a high-resolution dataset of power load and multiple meteorological factors from Chongqing demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the original Autoformer and its variants such as CNN-Autoformer and BiGRU-Autoformer across Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics in a 48-step forecasting task. The study validates the effectiveness of the framework in modeling complex temporal dependencies, providing an improved solution for short-term load forecasting in power systems."

Focusing on a specific type of wheeled vehicle operating in six typical regional environments-cold regions, hot and humid climates, gravel roads, plateau areas, undulating terrain, and paved roads-the study conducts a statistical analysis of the distribution of gear position, speed, and torque load under these operating conditions. The one-dimensional distributions of gear position, speed with driving time, as well as the two-dimensional distributions of speed-torque with driving time, are obtained. Taking the gearbox gears-critical components of the transmission system-as the research subject, the accumulated fatigue damage under these six operational scenarios is analysed based on the rotating rainflow counting method. Furthermore, by observing the speed-torque distribution characteristics observed in actual vehicle tests and adopting the principle of damage equivalence between bench tests and field conditions, a set of bench test loading conditions for the transmission system is derived. This provides essential technical support for the reliability testing of wheeled vehicle transmission systems under bench conditions."

In this paper, we address this issue with an optimized repositioning strategy that lowers environmental impact while improving operational efficiency and user satisfaction. After a data analysis phase, we present in detail a stochastic bike-sharing repositioning model that explicitly incorporates uncertainty on bike-demand prediction at each station, thereby improving the robustness of decision-making and the overall reliability of the system. To find the global optimum we then decompose the stochastic model into two manageable sub-problems and iteratively solve them to optimality with exact methods. We finally validates both our mathematical model and our algorithm by solving a synthetic instance, showing the potential of our method."

The motivation stems from the need to better understand memory effects in soft matter dynamics and to improve the modeling of time-dependent fluid–structure interactions. In earlier work, we used the Jumarie fractional derivative to derive exact analytical solutions. Here, we advance this investigation by employing the Caputo derivative, known for its suitability in modeling physical systems with initial conditions expressed in classical terms. Through numerical simulations, we perform a comparative analysis between the Caputo-based results and those obtained via the Jumarie framework. This comparison reveals both shared patterns and distinctive features, underscoring the sensitivity of vesicle dynamics to the choice of fractional operator. The novelty of our work lies in bridging the gap between two formulations of fractional derivatives, highlighting the Caputo operator’s capacity to capture memory-driven behaviors more realistically. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of vesicle mechanics in fluid environments and offer valuable insights for applications in biological physics, such as drug delivery systems and artificial cell modeling."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a collaborative voltage stability assessment framework that synergizes data-driven techniques with intelligent optimization, integrating deep interpretable networks with an improved particle swarm algorithm to achieve high-accuracy stability discrimination and efficient margin calculation. First, we design a dual-branch decoupled deep neural network architecture that leverages value-advantage branches to separately capture global stability and local critical features, while incorporating physical constraints from the Jacobian matrix to enhance critical state identification. Second, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (DNN-PSO) is proposed, utilizing neural network gradient information to guide particle swarm search for fast and precise localization of stability boundaries. Finally, simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 100% stability discrimination accuracy and completes margin assessments within 0.205 seconds."

This interest is driven by applications where output isolators are omitted to reduce system complexity and weight, such as in active phased-array antenna systems. Existing methods that extend <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-based or <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>-based stability criteria to large-signal operation are typically limited to considering mismatch at no more than three-sideband frequencies, which restricts their applicability for more general scenarios. In this article, an efficient criterion is proposed to assess the unconditional stability of PAs under large-signal operation, enabling the consideration of mismatch effects at an arbitrary number of sideband frequencies. The method relies on the computation of the structured singular value of a scattering-type matrix defined with virtual ports at the relevant sideband frequencies. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an amplifier prototype specifically designed to highlight the impact of sideband mismatch on circuit stability. Its validity is confirmed through comparison with independent stability analysis techniques. Finally, experimental verification is performed on the fabricated prototype using a dedicated setup capable of synthesizing different load impedance profiles."

    "abstract": "Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a long-standing challenge. This issue has been escalated due to denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and broader bandwidth in next-generation networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS). WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. While WRF-GS demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, it faces limitations in capturing high-frequency signal variations caused by complex multipath effects. To overcome these limitations, we propose WRF-GS+, an enhanced framework that integrates electromagnetic wave physics into the neural network design. WRF-GS+ leverages deformable 3D Gaussians to model both static and dynamic components of the WRF, significantly improving its ability to characterize signal variations. In addition, WRF-GS+ accelerates the splatting process by simplifying the 3D-GS modeling operation and reducing sample complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that both WRF-GS and WRF-GS+ outperform baselines for spatial spectrum synthesis, including ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Notably, WRF-GS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance in the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) prediction tasks, surpassing existing methods by more than 0.7 dB and 3.36 dB, respectively.

The E-learning ability was considered from five aspects, including conscious ability. A total of 689 questionnaires were distributed, and 646 questionnaires were recycled. The rationality of the questionnaire was verified by project analysis. According to the collected data, the differences in different aspects of E-learning ability and academic performance in terms of gender, age, and major were analyzed. The results showed that both the overall E-learning ability and academic performance of university students need to be improved. In terms of gender, only the technical ability had a significant difference (t = 3.947, p = 0.000). In terms of grade, there were significant differences in management ability, evaluation ability, and academic performance (p < 0.01). In terms of major, the E-learning ability and academic performance had significant differences (p < 0.01). The influence of E-learning ability on students’ academic performance was analyzed by regression analysis, and it was found that conscious, technical, and management abilities had positive predictive effects on academic performance. The results verify that E-learning ability has a positive impact on students’ academic performance, and university students should pay attention to improving E-learning ability."

    "abstract": "Communication overhead represents a primary bottleneck in distributed deep learning, impeding training scalability. Although existing gradient sparsification techniques reduce network traffic, they introduce critical limitations: they fail to optimize intra-node data paths and are incompatible with efficient, decentralized Allreduce operations. To address these issues, we propose D-DOSA, a DPU-based communication offloading framework. D-DOSA incorporates two key innovations: 1) D-DO, an architecture that establishes a direct GPU-DPU data path to offload data loading and intra-node communication from the host CPU; and 2) D-SA, a novel sparse Allreduce algorithm that, for the first time, enables compatibility between sparse tensors and high-performance, ring-based communication. We evaluated D-DOSA on a 8-node, DPU-enabled cluster using representative models including VGG, LSTM, and BERT. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework accelerates training by up to 1.32x compared to the state-of-the-art sparse training baseline, without compromising accuracy. Ultimately, D-DOSA shows that co-designing data-flow architectures and communication algorithms on the DPU resolves key bottlenecks in sparse training and presents a viable path toward scalable performance in larger systems."

At first, a prediction scheme for the considered system is developed step by step. Then, a predictor-based state feedback law is designed based on this prediction scheme. In addition, the property of the closed-loop system under the designed control law is analyzed. When the system state is unavailable for feedback, a full-order state observer is designed such that the current state can be estimated. With this estimated state, the stabilization for this class of time delay systems can also be achieved under the designed observer-based predictor feedback control law."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the strategic evolution of patent technologies in energy utilization and recovery, focusing on current technological landscapes and predicting patent development trends. We identify key insights into the sector's growth and future potential by analyzing 30,196 patents from the Google Patents database (2008-2023) and applying machine learning techniques. Patents were retrieved using International Patent Classification (IPC) codes specific to energy utilization and recovery, then de-duplicated and screened by the main patent office. Patent quality was estimated by backward-citation impact. The findings show that the energy recovery field is expanding, with a lifecycle coefficient expected to reach maturity by 2025. Additionally, the results indicate that technological development accelerated after the 2015 Paris Agreement, peaking in 2016 and 2020. However, notable disparities exist across technological subfields, with uneven distribution, highlighting the need for increased collaboration and cross-disciplinary innovation. The “drum-type steam boilers” sector emerges as a key area for future growth, with high potential for cross-technology applications, but receives disproportionately low funding. A Convolutional Neural Network model trained with the Adam optimizer achieved 73.6% accuracy in predicting patent citation trends, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in identifying high-quality patents and automating large-scale quality assessments. Furthermore, increasing patent citations and diversifying patent categories significantly enhance patent quality, with collaboration among patent teams playing a critical role in advancing cross-technology fields. These findings help optimize technological strategies, identify innovation gaps, and develop models for high-quality patent identification in energy utilization and recovery."

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizure prediction holds critical clinical significance for enhancing the quality of life in patients. Despite technological advances, existing approaches face persistent challenges arising from inter-subject variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics and the complex spatiotemporal coupling associated with ictal transitions. These issues compromise both feature discriminability and model explainability. To address these dual limitations, we propose a novel stationary wavelet transform (SWT)-driven dynamic multiscale fuzzy clustering (SD-MFC) framework, an explainable prediction pipeline that integrates EEG signal analysis with transparent clinical decision-making. Methodologically, the spectral-temporal decomposition of EEG signals via SWT is combined with a geometric attention mechanism to model cross-channel dependencies. To capture the dynamic nature of EEG signals, we develop a Riemannian manifold-based fuzzy clustering algorithm through covariance matrix optimization and time-variant manifold metrics. Hierarchical feature fusion is achieved through multiscale convolutional kernels within a three-layer convolutional network. Model training incorporates contrastive learning with a hybrid supervised/self-supervised strategy to enhance robustness. Notably, two explainability methods: a joint feature visualization strategy and an efficient feature ablation study, are proposed to bridge the adaptation gap between the “black-box” nature of deep learning models and the requirements of clinical diagnostic. Experimental results on both intracranial and extracranial datasets demonstrate that SD-MFC framework not only exhibits superior predictive performance but also maintains a low FPR, offering a feasible scheme for clinical application of EEG-based seizure prediction. The code has been available at https://github.com/JW-Image/SD-MFC."

To reduce the communication resources overhead, channel prediction techniques are widely used in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, most of the existing channel prediction methods predict future CSI based on the time-space domain channel matrix, which is susceptible to multipath and Doppler shift. In this letter, we propose a pre-processing method for the time-space domain channel matrix. Through a two-step transformation, we transform the channel to the time-frequency-angle domain. Then, we theoretically prove the resilience of the time-frequency-angle channel matrix to multipath and Doppler shift. The simulation results show that without changing the existing neural network architecture, the accuracy of channel prediction can be improved by using the proposed pre-processing method, and the proposed method is generalizable to different neural networks and different antenna configurations."

The obvious disadvantage is that the centralized detection methods used to identify phishing, which is common, are not compatible with such environments because of the danger of data aggregation and privacy leakage. The present paper has developed a Federated Learning (FL)-based privacy-preserving phishing detection framework adequately adapted to WHNs. The framework allows the machine learning models to be trained in a distributed fashion on wearable devices and does not require sending the raw data to a central server. The experiments were performed by applying Logistic Regression and Random Forest models in both federated and centralized. As results indicate, federated Random Forest model accuracy was 86.35%, which was very close to the centralized model which was 86.77, yet it maintained data privacy. Also, the federated Logistic Regression model also exhibited stability in performance throughout the rounds, proving that FL is a viable solution to lightweight wearable devices. The study points out that FL is both viable and effective to use on phishing detection of WHNs that provides excellent trade-off of vital aspects of privacy, scalability, and detection performance."

    "abstract": "Multispectral object detection using RGB and infrared (IR) imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly important for surveillance and rescue missions under challenging lighting conditions. However, effective fusion of RGB and IR features remains a significant challenge due to weak spatial alignment-a common issue resulting from independent sensor placement, geometric misalignment caused by UAV motion, and imperfect temporal synchronization between modalities. To address this problem, we propose CFYOLO, a cross-modal fusion framework specifically designed for object detection in weakly aligned RGB-IR UAV imagery. CFYOLO employs a dual-stream backbone based on the YOLO architecture to extract modality-specific features and introduces an effective Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module that selectively aggregates complementary information through spatialand channel-wise attention mechanisms. This design enhances robustness to alignment issues while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that CF-YOLO achieves strong detection performance (82.3 % mAP@ 50), outperforming both unimodal and existing fusion-based methods. These results validate the effectiveness of our attention-guided fusion strategy in real-world UAV scenarios where weak alignment is prevalent."

To this end, we introduce a dual-decomposed multi-scale parallel Transformer (DMPFormer) for restoring vision degraded by adverse weather conditions. Specifically, we develop a domain-decomposed feature enhancement mechanism (DFEM) to address issues arising from the self-attention mechanism in modeling high-frequency dependencies. DFEM decomposes features into spatial, wavelet and frequency domains, enabling more targeted and accurate feature learning. Meanwhile, we present a dimension-decomposed latent feature interaction module (DLFIM), which segregates features along height, width and channel dimensions, thereby optimizing feature fusion with multi-dimension mutual attention and adaptive determining weights. Besides, we propose a cross-scale implicit neural representation (CINR) for obtaining standardized representations of various degradations, which can adjustably provide visual prompts for subsequent reconstruction. Furthermore, we curate a comprehensive dataset containing diverse traffic weather-degraded image pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over existing approaches in both single and adverse weather removal."

Current research primarily focuses on single-scenario optimization of integrated energy systems, neglecting the actual energy demands of rural areas and inter-regional energy interactions. To address this, this paper establishes three typical rural scenarios—agricultural production zones, livestock farming zones, and tourism zones—and develops a coordinated optimal dispatch model for multi-regional energy systems. The model enables optimized scheduling of electricity, gas, heat, and cooling energy while leveraging the distinct energy advantages of each scenario. Results demonstrate that without coordinated optimization, the total operating cost reaches 104.755 million yuan with pollutant emissions of 38,091 tons. In contrast, coordinated optimization reduces the total operating cost to 86.21 million yuan and cuts emissions to 30,515 tons. These findings highlight that incorporating rural scenarios and harnessing their energy synergies significantly lowers system-wide costs and environmental impacts."

This paper presents a flexible, bioinspired magnetic tactile sensor system for non-visual surface condition monitoring. The sensor consists of vertically magnetized 3D micro-cilia arrays embedded in an elastomer and underlying Hall effect magnetic sensors. As the cilia slide across a surface, microscopic texture features bend the cilia, producing distinctive magnetic field fluctuations. The low-power sensor is highly flexible and durable, capable of enduring repeated contact. A sliding scan experiment was performed on eight different material surfaces, with multiple trials simulating human-like tactile exploration. The resulting magnetic field time-series were analyzed using a machine learning pipeline. After preprocessing and feature extraction, a supervised classification model was trained to recognize each material. The classifier achieved over 99% accuracy in identifying the surface textures. We further applied explainability techniques, i.e., feature importance analysis and SHAP values, to reveal which signal features differentiate textures. These results demonstrate that the magnetic cilia-based sensor can reliably \"feel\" and identify surface textures, enabling robust non-visual condition monitoring. This study highlights the potential of bioinspired magnetic tactile sensing for intelligent maintenance applications."

However, existing methods face significant challenges: conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to model long-range vascular dependencies due to limited local receptive fields, while pure Vision Transformers (ViTs) are hindered by high computational costs, limiting their real-time clinical application. To enhance the model’s discriminative capability, this study proposes a hybrid CNN-Transformer U-Net model (HCT-Net), which synergistically integrates CNN’s local feature extraction and Transformer’s global context modeling within a U-Net framework for efficient and accurate retinal multistructure segmentation. Evaluated on the DRIVE and CHASE DB1 datasets using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice coefficient, and Hausdorff Distance (HD) as metrics, the experimental results demonstrate that HCT-Net achieves superior performance in segmentation consistency of vascular trunks and fine branches, boundary clarity, and enhanced robustness in pathological regions (e.g., exudate interference) compared to existing baseline models. This study provides a novel paradigm balancing precision and efficiency for retinal image segmentation, advancing deployable intelligent ophthalmic systems that may support early detection of vascular abnormalities and assist nonspecialist clinicians in resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the optimization problem of task offloading in vehicular networks within a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environment. Due to dynamic network conditions and limited computational resources, task allocation presents significant challenges. Our focus lies in using four algorithms to optimize the offloading strategy for resource allocation, thereby comparing their impact on the system's performance and Quality of Service (QoS): Multi-Layer Dynamic Particle Optimization (MLDPO), Greedy Algorithm, Fair Resource Allocation (FRE), and Continuous Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). These Algorithms are compared in terms of computing latency, power consumption, and execution time under varying network conditions. In this study, resource allocation refers specifically to the CPU computing capacity at MEC servers, while bandwidth is assumed to be equally shared among all vehicles. Our simulation results show that WOA and FRE significantly outperform other algorithms in terms of QoS, particularly for scenarios with a large number of vehicles, making them suitable for massive connectivity. Notably, WOA and MLDPO exhibit almost similar behavior for lower vehicle numbers, while WOA outperforms FRE at medium vehicle densities. In contrast, the Greedy and FRE algorithms exhibit lower runtime, making them ideal for low-latency applications."

    "abstract": "In recent years, energy shortages have been increasing due to the overuse of fuels. The thermoelectric generator (TEG) system can be used to recycle exhaust gases from driving vehicles. In this study, a novel heat exchanger structure is proposed, which is located in the middle of the whole TEG system, with thermoelectric pieces uniformly distributed on the top and bottom. Based on the developed TEG system, the design parameters (number of ribs located in different regions, distance between ribs and diameter of ribs) and responses (temperature difference at the heat exchanger surface, hot air pressure drop and power generation) were analyzed by the response surface method. Multi-objective optimization of the five design parameters using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm produces a set of Pareto fronts. The results show that when the number of rib columns is 2, 6, and 7, respectively, the rib column spacing is 55.1 mm, and the rib column diameter is 9.66 mm, the three response variable weight parameters are 0.28, 0.37, and 0.35. Thus, resulting in the optimal TEG system with a heat exchanger temperature difference of 27 K, the pressure drop is 1069.14 Pa, and the power generation is 88.26 W."

However, current diagnostic methods primarily rely on clinical diagnosis by physicians and scale scoring, which are subject to high levels of subjectivity, high costs, and high rates of misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this study draws inspiration from traditional Chinese medicine’s “observation, auscultation and olfaction, inquiry, and pulse” principles to propose a multimodal MDD diagnostic model combining ‘observation’ (facial data) with “inquiry” (PHQ-9 questionnaire data). In this study, facial data features were extracted using DeepFace to train the Facial expert; PHQ-9 questionnaire data were used to train the Scale expert; facial data features and questionnaire data features were fused to train the Concatenation expert; and the Facial expert, Scale expert, and Concatenation expert were combined to train the Meta expert. The training results of the four experts were then trained using the Cooperation of Experts (CoE) framework to ultimately construct the Fusion expert. The results showed that the Fusion expert model had a Log Loss value of 0.0529 and an MDD diagnostic accuracy rate of 100%, indicating that the Fusion expert model significantly outperformed traditional diagnostic methods. This study provides novel insights and methods for the precise diagnosis of depression, demonstrating that the integration of traditional Chinese medicine and multimodal data holds promise for improving the accuracy of MDD auxiliary diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Automatic identification of accident causes from textual reports is a major challenge for improving risk management in industrial systems. This article proposes an approach based on automatic natural language processing (ANLP) and machine learning to predict accident causes from textual descriptions. A database of real accident reports was used, containing textual summaries (SummaryCase) and their associated causes (Cause). After text pre-processing including cleaning, tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF and Bag of Words), several supervised learning models were tested, including random forests (RF), logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) as well as XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). The performance of the model was examined in terms of the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. As a result those work demonstrate that an XGBoost combining with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) are more effective when compared to traditional models especially in the situation of long and complex text description. The results of this study have proved the effectiveness of the application of machine learning techniques to the proactive analysis of accident causes and are expected to contribute to the adaptation of these approaches into the realm of industrial risk management systems."

    "abstract": "As a critical load-bearing component of railway vehicles, the performance of rolling bearings directly affects the operational safety and reliability of trains. To meet the requirements of health monitoring and fault diagnosis for rolling bearings, a digital twin-driven dynamic modeling and signal generation framework is proposed. This framework introduces a 4 degrees-of-freedom dynamic model of rolling bearings, combined with a joint parameter-noise optimization mechanism based on digital twin technology. In this mechanism, both model parameters and the signal-to-noise ratio of added noise are treated as optimization variables. A coherence function-based objective function guides the particle swarm optimization to update the parameters and SNR simultaneously. The purpose of the framework is to correct the dynamic model, reduce distribution differences, and generate twin signals under normal and faulty conditions to achieve realistic mapping of the twin signals. A convolutional neural network is then employed for multi-class fault identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively enhances signal fidelity and improves the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis. This study provides a reliable solution for building a virtual-real fusion diagnostic model within bearing digital twin systems and offers important support for fault prediction and maintenance decision-making of railway vehicles."

    "abstract": "Although numerous lightweight methods for printed circuit board (PCB) defect detection have been extensively studied in recent years, most are designed for normal visibility conditions. Consequently, limited attention to low visibility scenarios has led to degraded performance in such environments. In this paper, we address the challenge of PCB defect detection under lowlight conditions by proposing a novel GAN-based knowledge distillation network (GKD-Net). The proposed framework consists of three integrated components: an Illumination enhancement (IL) subnetwork, a knowledge transfer (KT) subnetwork, and a defect detection (DD) subnetwork. GKD-Net enables end-to-end training for sequentially learning three tasks: Illumination enhancement, feature transmission, and object detection. In GKDNet, the IL subnetwork is responsible for producing clear feature representations from low-light input images. These enhanced features are then transmitted by the KT subnetwork to the DD subnetwork to facilitate learning and accurately define objects, thereby improving overall model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GKD-Net yields a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.87 % on the DD-PCB dataset, outperforming competing methods while maintaining the realtime inference speed of the baseline detector."

    "abstract": "Telecommunications, healthcare, and global supply chains operate under constant pressure to process vast amounts of data while maintaining reliability, security, and regulatory compliance. When scalability is pursued without parallel ethical safeguards, the risk of privacy breaches, biased outcomes, and opaque automation increases. To address this, we propose a six- pillar framework that places human oversight, explainability, privacy-by-design, modularity, interoperability, and accessibility at the core of data system design. The framework draws on more than 17 years of practical experience across multinational programs and a self-funded research initiative in digital health. Its applicability is demonstrated through three operational contexts: the shift to paperless workflows and automated Key Performance Indicator (KPI) pipelines in telecom networks, the harmonization of performance models in supply chains, and a confidential decision-support assistant for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). A conceptual simulation of the latter indicated a $\\mathbf{1 5}-\\mathbf{2 0} \\boldsymbol{\\%}$ reduction in insulin dosing errors when human oversight was preserved, with response times under two seconds. The findings show that embedding ethical design principles into system architecture strengthens transparency, trust, and adoption, and provides a transferable blueprint for responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment across regulated, data-intensive domains."

To address these issues, indoor cultivation has been proposed as a viable alternative. This study focuses on evaluating saffron plant growth under three lighting conditions which is sunlight spectrum LED, conventional LED, and a dark environment. The results revealed significant differences in saffron plant growth and physiological activity depending on the lighting environment. Saffron plants grown using sunlight spectrum LED demonstrated the highest growth performance, producing 49 flowers, while those under conventional LED produced 38 flowers, and those in a dark environment produced only 10 flowers. This means saffron plants grown using sunlight spectrum LED produced 1.29 times higher (29 %) flowers compared to the conventional LED and 4.9 times higher (390 %) flowers compared to the dark environment. Conversely, saffron plants grown using the conventional LED produced 0.78 times lower (22 %) than the sunlight spectrum LED but still outperformed the dark environment by producing flowers 3.8 times higher (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 8 0 \\%}$</tex>). The dark environment resulted in the lowest growth, producing flowers 4.9 times lower (80 %) than in the sunlight spectrum LED condition and 3.8 times lower (74 % less) than in the conventional LED condition. Saffron plants exposed to sunlight spectrum LED demonstrated enhanced growth performance, likely due to the spectral similarity of sunlight spectrum LED to natural sunlight."

For this reason, this paper proposes a drive train fault diagnosis method based on the fusion of acoustic and vibration information. First, three vibration sensors and three acoustic sensors are arranged in the nacelle of the doubly-fed wind turbine to collect vibration information from the main shaft, gearbox, and yaw reducer, as well as acoustic information in the nacelle and yaw platform, respectively. An acoustic-vibration information fusion method, based on drive train spectrum similarity, is constructed, combining time-domain, spectral, and envelope analyses to reveal the operational status and potential fault characteristics of each component. The results show that acoustic-vibration fusion monitoring improves drive train fault diagnosis reliability, laying the foundation for both continuous fault monitoring and independent acoustic pattern monitoring applications in similar units."

The model focuses on envelope spectrum analysis and uses the Fault Feature Coefficient (FFC) to label signal data. The CNN extracts features from both time and frequency domains, while the BiLSTM captures sequential characteristics. These combined features enable binary classification of diagnostic success or failure. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves high evaluation accuracy. Comparative analysis indicates that CNN-BiLSTM performs better than CNN-LSTM in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. This approach provides a reliable framework for evaluating fault diagnosis techniques and supports the selection of appropriate methods for analyzing bearing vibration signals."

Information sharing and coordinated optimization are realized through a low-latency communication protocol. Simulation results based on OpenDSS and deep reinforcement learning platforms show that the proposed strategy significantly improves voltage regulation accuracy and qualification rate under multiple operating conditions, reduces reactive power losses and equipment switching frequency, and enhances system robustness and response speed. Compared with traditional PID control and single-layer reinforcement learning control, the proposed method demonstrates superiority in improving voltage quality, energy efficiency, and equipment lifespan, exhibiting strong potential for practical engineering applications."

The composite material struts are commonly lack of damping. As a result, the response of the SAR antenna can be very large which is not good to the SAR antenna. Some examples show that the SAR antenna can be broken after large vibration test or the accuracy will lose. Therefore, to control the vibration response at the vibration test period is very important. In this paper, a support structure is built with and without the viscous damper. The comparison is given between the two models in terms of the vibration response under the same excitation. The results show that the entire modal is decreased when the dampers are added. However, the peak response of the SAR antenna is greatly decreased which means the damper can performed well when the parameters are selected carefully. This paper provides a new idea for vibration suppression of large-scale SAR antenna, which has guiding significance for actual engineering."

This method refines the traditional two-stage operation process of power to gas (P2G), and establishes the coupling model of cogeneration and carbon capture system (CCS), electrolyzer (EL), methane reactor (MR), and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC). The system considers the direct participation of hydrogen energy in gas-fired hydrogen-doped power generation to achieve economic goals, and the inclusion of carbon trading to realize low-carbon goals. The low-carbon benefits of the system are quantified by three indicators: renewable energy penetration rate, wind and solar energy abandonment rate, and hydrogen participation rate. The results show that the system can not only increase the consumption of new wind and solar energy, reduce carbon emissions, but also reduce the daily operating costs of the system, which verifies the feasibility of the transition to a low-carbon carbon park."

This paper designs a closed-loop rail pressure controller based on the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Control (LADRC). The controller integrates RBFNN into the LADR, where Jacobian information generated by the neural network enhances the controller’s ability to perceive the system's dynamic characteristics. Moreover, the controller bandwidth parameter is adaptively tuned online. Co-simulation results based on the AMEsim-Simulink platform demonstrate that the proposed RBF-LADRC controller achieves significantly faster step response, near-zero overshoot, and improves steady-state control accuracy by 54% and 43% compared to PID and LADRC controllers, respectively.

The achieved performance with different combinations of input features is analysed both globally and for specific crops.

    "abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) has fundamentally transformed surgical practice by expanding the boundaries of human motion, offering increased precision and dexterity. It has opened new opportunities for autonomous and remote surgery beyond traditional operating room settings. The repertoire of possibilities is currently limited by the absence of haptic feedback, challenges in intraoperative communication, and ergonomic constraints. In this study, we gathered insights from clinically active surgeons across multiple specialties to identify current limitations and unmet needs in RAS. We hereby aim to bridge real-world surgical challenges by facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration and advancing the field through focused technological and clinical development. This study underscores the critical need for enhanced haptic feedback, improved intraoperative communication tools, and ergonomic refinements in RAS. Addressing these issues is essential to optimize surgical performance and patient outcomes. Future developments of robotic-assisted systems should prioritize multimodal concepts of sensory integration in order to improve the sense of embodiment within the surgical environment."

This paper establishes baseband equivalent model for the delay-line-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-OAM communications and provides a systematic performance evaluation. The theoretical analysis demonstrates complete elimination of inter-carrier interference, while revealing that perfect mode orthogonality is preserved only at the central subcarrier (carrier frequency), with all other subcarriers experiencing inter-mode interference that scales with relative bandwidth. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance loss caused by the delay-line effect."

    "abstract": "The detection of listening effort or cognitive load (CL) has been a major research challenge in recent years. Most conventional techniques utilise physiological or audio-visual sensors and are privacy-invasive and computationally complex. The challenges of synchronization, data alignment and accessibility limitations potentially increase the noise and error probability, compromising the accuracy of CL estimates. This innovative work presents a multi-modal, non-invasive and privacy-preserving approach that combines Radio Frequency (RF) and pupillometry sensing to address these challenges. Custom RF sensors are first designed and developed to capture blood flow changes in specific brain regions with high spatial resolution. Next, multi-modal fusion with pupillometry sensing is proposed and shown to offer a robust assessment of cognitive and listening effort through pupil size and pupil dilation. Our novel approach evaluates RF sensing to estimate CL from cerebral blood flow variations utilizing pupillometry as a baseline. A first-of-its-kind, multi-modal dataset is collected as a new benchmark resource in a controlled environment with participants to comprehend target speech with varying background noise levels. The framework is statistically evaluated using intraclass correlation for pupillometry data (average ICC> 0.95). The correlation between pupillometry and RF data is established through Pearson's correlation (average PCC> 0.79). Further, CL is classified into high and low categories based on RF data using K-means clustering. Future work involves integrating RF sensors with glasses to estimate listening effort for hearing-aid users and utilising RF measurements to optimize speech enhancement based on individual's listening effort and complexity of acoustic environment."

    "abstract": "In satellite-assisted IoT communications, circularly polarized (CP) phased array antennas enable devices to directly connect with the satellites. This paper proposes a shared-aperture dual-CP antenna where low-band and high-band antennas are coaxially arranged for miniaturization. The low-band antenna is a dual-feed shorted ring patch loaded with small circles, whereas the high-band antenna is a compact single-probe-fed patch loaded with an oval parasitic patch. Both low-band and high-band antennas have broadband characteristics. Cross-band decoupling in the high-band is achieved by exciting the TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub> mode of the low-band antenna and loading a parasitic ring. Additionally, the shorted metallic vias of the low-band antenna form a metallic back-cavity for the high-band antenna to further suppress interference from the low-band, and a pair of stubs is loaded on the feed of the high-band antenna to improve the port isolation in the low-band. Four prototypes, each consisting of 2×8 dual-band antennas, are fabricated and measured. Broad overlapped impedance and axial ratio bandwidths from 12.2 to 14 GHz and from 16.1 to 17.8 GHz are achieved for the low-band and high-band operations. A small frequency ratio of 1.29 is realized while the cross-band isolation exceeds 38 dB in the low-band and 26 dB in the high-band. The proposed dual circularly polarized antenna can achieve a scanning range of ±50° in both bands. As a result, the proposed compact dual-CP phased array antenna supports integration with small IoT terminals, while enabling stable connections for mobile devices or satellite terminals."

FAASTRACKER tracks function behaviors across layers using a non-intrusive agent without any modifications to the function. In addition, it correlates data from multiple sources to construct a provenance graph of function workflows to locate attackers. We implement FAASTRACKER on the OpenFaaS platform and evaluate its performance using real-world serverless applications. Compared with state-of-the-art serverless provenance systems, FAASTRACKER provides a more accurate and complete view of provenance graphs and reduces 54.0% CPU and 48.9% memory resources."

Since the discovery of the first antibiotics, pathogens have developed different mechanisms of resistance against antibiotics. Today, the technology to understand the mechanisms of AMR and their genomics is more competent than ever. This paper provides a wide range of information about using genomic data combined with machine learning for predicting antibiotic resistance and proposes a multi-model approach ASAP (Antibiotic Susceptibility and Antibiogram Pre diction) for creating antibiograms. In this work, 10 different machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network, Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gradient Boost, and Logistic Regression, have been tested, evaluated, and compared for their predictive capabilities. For data preprocessing, different methods of feature extraction through n-gram encoding have been tested. For the evaluation of the models, accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores are used. Experiments show that models can predict the antibiotic resistance of a given pathogen sequence with up to 0.99 accuracy and 0.90+ macro average recall. The best performing model for this work has been XGBoost with 0.99 accuracy, and the least predictive model has been Naive Bayes with 0.89 accuracy. Our proposed method results shows that machine learning with gene sequences are promising tools to improve the current manual antibiogram creation, maintenance process and can provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights for less empirical antibiotic prescribing"

    "abstract": "Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is challenging due to intra-class variations and inter-class similarities. FER can be especially difficult when facial expressions reflect a mixture of various emotions (aka compound expressions). Existing FER datasets, such as AffectNet, provide discrete emotion labels (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hard-labels</i>), where a single category of emotion is assigned to an expression. To alleviate inter- and intra-class challenges, as well as provide a better facial expression descriptor, we propose a new approach to create FER datasets through a labeling method in which an image is labeled with more than one emotion (called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">soft-labels</i>), each with a different confidence.

    "abstract": "In analog-to-digital converter (ADC)- and digital signal processing (DSP)-based long-reach PAM-4 wireline receivers, incorrect initial threshold settings can hinder equalizer coefficient convergence and degrade signal integrity. While maximum-likelihood sequence detection mitigates decision feedback equalizer (DFE) error propagation and improves bit error rate (BER), its high latency makes it unsuitable for latency-sensitive applications. This paper proposes two circuit techniques that enhance threshold estimation and suppress DFE error propagation with minimal latency. First, a 1−<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i> partial-response (PR) filter is introduced to reshape the received signal, inducing negative autocorrelation that improves initial threshold estimation, even when the transmitted symbols are originally uncorrelated. Second, a low-latency DFE-CURE (Correction under Uncertainty with Reverse-decision Evaluation) architecture evaluates two candidate sequences—one based on the original decision and the other based on an alternative symbol—and selects the path with the lower accumulated metric. This avoids full-sequence decoding while adding only three DSP clock cycles of latency beyond the conventional DFE, resulting in a total of five cycles after feed-forward equalization. A 56-Gb/s PAM-4 ADC/DSP-based receiver, fabricated in a 28-nm process, is evaluated under 23.1-dB channel loss. Simulations show that the 1−<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i> PR filter reduces threshold estimation error by 83%, and DFE-CURE lowers BER from 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−5</sup> to 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−6</sup>, achieving a 10× improvement."

    "abstract": "DC microgrids are vital for renewable energy integration and distributed energy management, but their expanding scale and complex operation with diverse topologies expose critical limitations. These methods, primarily designed for simple single-bus structures, fail to coordinate voltage deviation suppression, system stability enhancement, and economic optimization effectively in multi-bus scenarios. To address this, a multi-objective optimization approach for DC microgrids (DCMG) with complex topologies is proposed. It integrates small-signal stability, bus voltage deviation, and operational economy into a unified framework, incorporates randomness of power generation and loads, and adapts to mesh topology with diverse node types. Case studies verify the method exhibits strong adaptability and robustness under stochastic scenarios, achieving balanced improvements in stability and economic efficiency: the system small-signal stability index is reduced by 19.3%, bus voltage deviation is lowered by 71.2%, and system power loss is decreased by 2.1%.  This work provides key technical support for the efficient and reliable operation of DC microgrids with complex topologies, advancing their practical application in complex energy systems."

    "abstract": "A crucial task in predictive maintenance is estimating the remaining useful life of physical systems. In the last decade, deep learning has improved considerably upon traditional model-based and statistical approaches in terms of predictive performance. However, in order to optimally plan maintenance operations, it is also important to quantify the uncertainty inherent in the predictions. This issue can be addressed by turning standard frequentist neural networks into Bayesian neural networks, which are naturally capable of providing confidence intervals around the estimates. Several methods exist for training those models. Researchers have focused mostly on parametric variational inference and sampling-based techniques, which notoriously suffer from limited approximation power and large computational burden, respectively. In this work, we use Stein variational gradient descent, a recently proposed algorithm for approximating intractable distributions that overcomes the drawbacks of the aforementioned techniques. In particular, we show through experimental studies on both simulated run-to-failure turbofan engine degradation data and real industrial battery degradation data that Bayesian deep learning models trained via Stein variational gradient descent consistently outperform with respect to convergence speed and predictive performance both the same models trained via parametric variational inference and their frequentist counterparts trained via backpropagation. Furthermore, we propose a method to enhance performance based on the uncertainty information provided by the Bayesian models."

    "abstract": "High-precision positioning plays a pivotal role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling reliable navigation, automated intersection management and high-precision platooning for autonomous vehicles in large-scale, unfamiliar environments. However, existing loosely or tightly coupled integration solutions of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and Visual System can be challenged by the limited availability of GNSS signals, which will affect their ability to consistently achieve robust high-precision positioning in harsh environments. In this work, we propose a multi-sensor (GNSS/INS/Vision) ultra-tightly coupled system with GNSS carrier phase long coherent integration tracking (MUT-LCI). At the signal processing level, MUT-LCI utilizes the multi-sensor sensed dynamics to assist GNSS signal tracking loops and realizes extended coherent integration periods up to 300 milliseconds, improving the availability of GNSS carrier phase observations in highly challenging environments significantly. The data fusion of the GNSS RTK/INS/Vision is conducted using a Multi-state Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF). To evaluate the performance of the proposed MUT-LCI system, we conducted experiments using an intelligent transportation wheeled robot platform in harsh environments, including areas covered by dense tree canopies and surrounded by tall buildings. The results demonstrate that the proposed MUT-LCI system achieves precise GNSS carrier phase signal tracking in highly challenging environments, enabling continuous RTK fixed solutions and providing reliable centimeter-level positioning accuracy."

Due to their ease of installation and minimal environment constraints, microphone arrays have become an important non-contact monitoring technology. However, traditional beamforming methods rely on the accurate estimation of the target signal direction and often exhibit low diagnostic accuracy and limited adaptability in complex noise environments. To tackle this issue, a fault diagnosis approach based on wavelet-domain polynomial eigenvalue decomposition (PEVD) is proposed for microphone array signal. This method eliminates the need for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and enables fault diagnosis without relying on any prior information. First, the acquired time-domain array signals are converted to wavelet domain using wavelet decomposition. Subsequently, PEVD is applied to the wavelet coefficients at each decomposition layer, and the Gini index (GI) is used to evaluate signal characteristics. Finally, the reconstructed signal undergoes analysis to extract fault features from its envelope spectrum. The comparative analysis indicates that the proposed approach demonstrates superior capability in fault identification."

To address this, we introduce the DRAM-BGRU model. Initially, two optimized parallel one-dimensional residual networks (1D-ResNet) are designed to extract spatial features while mitigating gradient issues. Subsequently, an AM is incorporated to capture significant fault features. Following this, a BGRU is positioned after the 1D-ResNet and AM to explore temporal characteristics of the sample signals. Ultimately, global average pooling consolidates information from these hybrid modules, with a fully connected layer outputting the final classification. Testing our approach on planetary gear data yields a perfect classification accuracy of 100%.

The architecture of the imitation learning framework incorporates the ResNet18 network alongside a mixture of expert's strategy. The actions executed within the environment are trained to align with the specialization of the expert blocks. The effectiveness of each module has undergone rigorous testing and validation. Notable features of this framework include high accuracy with the trained data and rapid inference speed, characterized by optimal latency and throughput. Importantly, the model consists of only 1.5 million parameters, facilitating effective adaptation to the hardware configuration. Additionally, the latency and throughput of each integrated module are optimized for real-time inference, thereby enhancing navigation efficiency. The inference results demonstrate a close alignment with the ideal parameters established during training, achieving a loss index of only 0.014."

A conceptual and analytical approach is adopted, combining a review of existing literature on DSS, digital nudging (DN), and behavioral decision theory, with illustrative case examples highlighting how nudging mechanisms can be embedded in intelligent decision interfaces. The integration of DN into DSS enhances user engagement and improves decision quality by mitigating cognitive biases. NDDS leverage user-centered interfaces, AI-driven personalization, and behavioral triggers to subtly influence choices aligned with organizational objectives, without restricting autonomy. NDDS offer significant potential for both public and private organizations seeking to optimize strategic and operational decisions. Their implementation can lead to smarter decision environments, particularly in digital services, policy design, and complex operational systems. This study proposes a novel framework for NDDS, positioning them as an evolutionary step beyond traditional DSS. It bridges decision science, behavioral economics, and digital design to reimagine how decision support technologies can be made more adaptive, intelligent, and behaviorally aware."

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a metabolic disorder. Diabetes screening refers to the systematic identification of individuals who may have diabetes or be in the pre-diabetic stage among seemingly healthy populations without obvious diabetic symptoms through specific detection methods and procedures. This enables early detection, intervention, and management of the disease, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes and its complications. Studies have shown that photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can reflect vascular blood flow fluctuations and are associated with hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis. Focusing on the blood flow fluctuation characteristics contained in pulse waves, this experiment utilizes three algorithms: Spatial Position Encoding (SPE), Gramian Angular Field (GAF), and Recurrence Plot (RP) to convert PPG signal segments into dynamic fused images. Subsequently, a Mobile Vision Transformer (MobileVIT) model embedded with PKIblock multi-scale convolution is used to extract multi-scale features and conduct classification experiments. The effectiveness of the method was verified on a self-collected PPG medical dataset. Different deep learning models were employed for image modeling and analysis to validate the classification performance, and comparisons were made with the results of other related diabetes research. The results showed that the classification accuracy of the proposed model reached $\\mathbf{9 8. 3 3 \\%}$, which can accurately classify normal and diabetic populations. This provides a novel and convenient solution for the initial screening and daily monitoring of diabetes."

    "abstract": "Face recognition under low-light conditions presents major challenges due to low visibility, poor contrast, color bias, and image noise, all of which degrade recognition performance. To overcome these limitations, Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) techniques have been applied, ranging from traditional methods such as Fisherface and CLAHE to deep learning approaches including feature reconstruction networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recent studies also explore hybrid methods, such as YOLO-Eigenfaces, YOLO-HMMs, and MSRCR combined with PyramidBox, which show promising results in extreme low-light settings. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of lowlight face recognition (LLFR) research published between 2019 and September 2024. The review is based on 40 selected studies retrieved from ScienceDirect, Scopus, and SpringerLink using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis reveals that the LOL dataset is the most widely used, with PSNR and SSIM serving as standard evaluation metrics. Deep learning has emerged as the dominant and state-of-the-art approach in LLFR research, offering substantial improvements in both image enhancement and recognition performance."

Using a dynamic-layer crystallizer, the effects of cooling finger temperature (-7 to -11 °C) and initial salt concentration (20 to 50 g/kg) on ice purity were examined. The results confirm that higher initial salinity increases salt entrapment in the ice, while less negative refrigerant temperatures promote the formation of purer ice by favoring solute exclusion. These findings align with known crystallization phenomena and highlight the potential of freezing as an effective pretreatment step in hybrid desalination systems."

This paper examines how major publishers and academic institutions worldwide are responding to AI-assisted manuscript preparation through policy development. By analyzing policies from Springer Nature, Elsevier, Taylor & Francis, PLOS, and positions from national accreditation bodies in Russia and Belarus, we identify three distinct regulatory models: prohibition, mandatory disclosure, and liberal approaches. Our comparative analysis reveals tensions between maintaining academic integrity and embracing technological innovation. We argue that current policies reflect broader transformations in the social construction of authorship, where responsibility and accountability remain uniquely human attributes while AI tools increasingly participate in knowledge production. The paper concludes with recommendations for developing differentiated policies that balance transparency requirements with practical research needs, particularly for dissertation research where demonstration of independent scholarly capability remains paramount."

An instability fault can cause extensive impact and enormous losses. Thus, developing a transient stability control strategy for new energy-integrated grids is urgently needed. This paper proposes a data-driven critical clearing time (CCT) evaluation and corrective control method for transient stability based on the BO-LightGBM (Bayesian optimized LightGBM) model. The feasibility of applying BO-LightGBM to power system transient stability is analyzed through CCT prediction and evaluation. Based on the BO-LightGBM predicted CCT results, the sensitivity of CCT corresponding to different generators is calculated. Meanwhile, the BO-LightGBM corrective model adjusts CCT to exceed the relay protection operation time with minimal generator power variation, enhancing system stability. Simulation results in new energy-integrated grids show that the proposed method accurately achieves transient stability assessment and rapid emergency control after instability, verifying its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "There is a pulse wave extraction method based on the separation of Pulse Wave (PW) and Stationary Noise (SNoise) from two observation signals containing PW and SNoise. In this method, PW is selected from two series of separation signals. In the conventional PW extraction method, the PW is selected from the separation signals using their kurtosis and skewness. In the conventional method, the procedure for selecting PW from the separation signals is as follows. First, block processing is performed for the separation signals. Next, the kurtosis and skewness are computed from each block of the separation signals. Finally, PW is selected for each block using these values. By using this method, PW selection is performed with high accuracy for the separation signals reproducing the source signals with high accuracy. In this selection, only information from each block is used. Therefore, the conventional method cannot select with high accuracy for separation signals reproducing the source signals with low accuracy. In this paper, we use information of all previous separation signals for PW selection based on adaptive computation of kurtosis and skewness. Then, we propose PW extraction method to select the PW with high accuracy, even if separation signals reproducing the source signals are low accuracy."

    "abstract": "Class imbalance in transmission line fault data hinders accurate fault diagnosis, as rare faults (e.g. lightning strikes or pollution flashovers) are underrepresented. We propose an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to synthesize realistic and diverse fault waveforms for six fault types (lightning strike, foreign object, wildfire, icing, wind deviation, pollution flashover), thereby augmenting minority classes. Our model extends the basic cGAN by embedding class labels into both generator and discriminator, and by adding regularization losses (auxiliary classification and diversity losses) to improve sample variety. We detail the network architectures, conditioning strategy, and loss functions. Training uses normalized time-series segments of waveform data, optimizing via Adam with tuned hyperparameters. In experiments, synthetic waveforms closely match real ones in shape (illustrated visually) and statistical metrics. Quantitatively, the improved cGAN achieves much lower Fréchet Distance and higher diversity scores than a baseline, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fidelity, varied samples. This approach can alleviate data scarcity for rare faults. Future work will integrate these synthetic signals into fault-classifiers and explore other domain constraints."

The proposed microgrid is intended to supply electricity to a group of buildings in New Alamein City, Egypt, using local meteorological data-including temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed-for system evaluation and design. SFOA is employed to determine the optimal configuration that minimizes the net present cost (NPC), reduces the cost of energy (COE), and lowers the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), while enhancing system stability under varying climatic conditions. An energy management system (EMS) is also implemented to coordinate energy flow from the multiple hybrid microgrid elements (HMGE), ensuring continuous load coverage and achieving optimal system sizing. The effectiveness of SFOA is validated through comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms, including Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), and the Bird Natural Life-based COOT algorithm. According to the MATLAB simulation results, the suggested SFOA-based CHMG design performs better than the alternative approaches in terms of COE, NPC, and LPSP.

    "abstract": "Repetitive transient impulses detection methods are often hindered under the severe operating conditions of locomotive real-world engineering applications. One of the primary challenges in existing approaches is the use of fixed spectral segmentation strategies, which fail to account for the unique characteristics of the spectrum, often leading to the loss of critical fault signatures. Additionally, current state-of-the-art indicators are highly sensitive to strong background noise and depend heavily on prior knowledge of fault-related frequencies. Aiming to overcome the aforementioned constraints, this study introduces an innovative methodology for fault detection called LEASGgram, specifically designed to identify repetitive transient impulses under severe disturbance conditions. The proposed method develops an adaptive segmentation strategy for frequency bands, leveraging multi-scale spectral analysis, enabling automatic partitioning of the frequency domain according to its intrinsic distribution features. Moreover, a novel evaluation metric is formulated based on the log envelope autocorrelation spectrum, enabling the simultaneous characterization of signal sparsity and cyclostationarity attributes. This allows for accurate localization of the resonance bands excited by repetitive fault-induced transients. Compared with conventional signal processing techniques, the proposed LEASGgram demonstrates superior performance in extracting informative frequency bands with enhanced fault relevance and reduced noise interference, even under harsh operational conditions."

    "abstract": "Fast and accurate estimation of lightpaths’ quality of transmission (QoT) is crucial for ensuring quality of service (QoS) and seamless operation in real-world optical networks. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are promising tools for QoT estimation of lightpaths before their establishment. In multi-domain optical networks, where learned QoT estimation models must be transferred between heterogeneous environments with limited target data, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising results. However, DNN-based transfer learning (TL) approaches using fine-tuned artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer limited interpretability. Consequently, little insight into the decision-making process is provided, and large labeled datasets as well as high computational resources are required, limiting their suitability for real-time, large-scale deployment in production networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel lightweight and interpretable TL framework that integrates the Boruta-SHAP algorithm for automated feature selection (FS) together with two domain adaptation (DA) techniques: Feature Augmentation and Correlation Alignment. In contrast to the existing approaches based on DNN, our strategy leverages interpretable and efficient ML models to enhance the adaptability across diverse datasets in real-world network environments. We show that our random forest (RF)-based models achieve better performance than the ANN-based models, without sacrificing the classification accuracy. The FS via Boruta-SHAP allows for reducing dimensionality as well as training and inference times up to 70.68%, and 41.64%, respectively. Our proposed framework outperforms DA baseline models achieving 99.35% accuracy improvement in domain shift. Moreover, it offers 86% accuracy with a 99.83% reduction in the size of the target domain."

Firstly, an attractive vector is constructed based on relative position between vehicles and target. The constructed vector, combined with the angular deviation of the trajectory’s circular center associated with nonholonomic vehicles, is used to design circular formation controllers. The collisions during the formation process are effectively prevented by the control laws. Subsequently, a more applicable circular formation control law ensuring collision avoidance is proposed for a scenario with onboard sensor occlusion. The proposed control laws eliminate the need for the uniform angular spacing between vehicles and are completely independent of the number nonholonomic vehicles. Finally, the validation of the designed controllers are carried out through both numerical simulations and physical experiments."

The metasurface consists of 23×23 Fractal-Based Phase Gradient (FBPG) units with a three-layer structure to generate quasi-Bessel beams. These beams enable uniform energy transmission while achieving energy focusing. Positioned at the focal point, the rectifying antenna captures the focused energy, converting it into direct current output. The antenna adopts a hybrid structure, coupling a parallel dipole with a dielectric resonator (PDi-DR) to enhance reception efficiency and directivity. Experimental results show that the metasurface achieves a focal length of 500 mm at 5.8 GHz. The PDi-DR antenna has a bandwidth of 4.6–7.1 GHz, a gain of 8.1 dBi, and a front-to-back ratio of 21 dB at 5.8GHz. The antenna gain can be increased to 16.1 dBi through the placement of the metasurface in front of the rectifying antenna. This design scheme achieves a PCE of 73.74% at an input power of 15 dBm, indicating its viability as a green energy source for low-power electronics and its potential for wide-ranging applications."

The key idea is to evaluate closed-loop performance as the expected cost over a prescribed distribution of initial states, which enables sensitivity analysis and gradient-based updates of the design parameters, while the controller is improved through policy iteration. As a result, the proposed method overcomes restrictive structural assumptions such as system equivalence, thereby avoiding conservatism and allowing flexible incorporation of design-dependent costs. Moreover, closed-loop stability is ensured at every iteration of the co-design procedure by embedding a recursive admissibility verification that combines two complementary Lyapunov conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example of a load positioning system."

    "abstract": "Sleep micro-events, such as sleep spindles and K-complexes, are closely associated with neurological cognitive functions. While artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted sleep micro-event detection provides automated annotation to reduce reliance on labor-intensive expert labeling, current supervised approaches require precisely annotated datasets that remain scarce in clinical practice. To overcome this data bottleneck, this paper introduces a Weakly Supervised Sleep Micro-Event Detector (WSSMED) that leverages readily available coarse sleep stage annotations. The proposed WSSMED features a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a wave prototype module and a cluster module, designed to capture the fine-grained sleep micro-event patterns experts rely on for sleep staging. This framework infers expert logic from coarse annotations while mitigating performance degradation caused by annotation inconsistencies arising from inter-rater variability. Experiments conducted on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate that WSSMED achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting sleep spindles and K-complexes, as evaluated at both sample-level and event-level in terms of precision, recall and F1-score metrics. Furthermore, subject-level evaluation demonstrates that the density and duration of micro-events detected by WSSMED-key metrics linked to cognitive function and neurological status-align more closely with expert annotations than those of other reported methods. These results highlight the clinical potential of WSSMED for reliable sleep micro-event analysis."

    "abstract": "Knowledge transfer aims to apply existing knowledge to different tasks or new data, and it has extensive applications in multi-domain and Multi-Task Learning. The key to this task is quickly identifying a fine-grained object for knowledge sharing and efficiently transferring knowledge. Current methods, such as fine-tuning, layer-wise parameter sharing, and task-specific adapters, only offer coarse-grained sharing solutions and struggle to effectively search for shared parameters, thus hindering the performance and efficiency of knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose Channel-Wise Parameter Sharing (CWPS), a novel fine-grained parameter-sharing method for knowledge transfer, which is efficient for parameter sharing, comprehensive, and plug-and-play. For the coarse-grained problem, we first achieve fine-grained parameter sharing by refining the granularity of shared parameters from the level of layers to the level of neurons. The knowledge learned from previous tasks can be utilized through the explicit composition of the model neurons. Besides, we promote an effective search strategy to minimize computational costs, simplifying the selection of shared weights. In addition, our CWPS has strong composability and generalization ability, which theoretically can be applied to any network consisting of linear and convolution layers. We introduce several datasets in both Incremental Learning and Multi-Task Learning scenarios. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art precision-to-parameter ratio performance with various backbones, demonstrating its efficiency and versatility."

    "abstract": "The regulation and control of neutron transport behavior is crucial to the design and development of nuclear energy systems and the application of nuclear technology. The accurate and efficient regulation of neutrons to satisfy the specific needs of neutron experimental environments is an urgent challenge to be solved. The traditional forward neutron spectrum regulation method based on artificial designing could hardly meet the demands of high accuracy and high efficiency at the same time. In this research, an adaptive optimization regulation method for neutron spectrum based on reinforcement learning was developed. The proposed method designed different types of standardized response modules and calibrated it with their corresponding multi-dimensional response matrix calculated by the Monte Carlo program. Through the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm outputs the selection and layout of the response module, and generates the optimal scheme that conforms to the target neutron spectrum by the process of continuous interaction with the environment and self-game. The 14MeV single-energy neutron source was used to verify the regulated results of the proposed method on the tritium breeder blanket of a fusion reactor (ITER) whose results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method was improved by 39.31% compared to the forward manual experiment."

    "abstract": "Ownership relationships of early printed books from the 15th century reveal complex patterns of distribution and possession, offering valuable insights for historical research. This paper presents OwnershipTracker, a visual analytics application developed to explore and trace these relationships using data from the Material Evidence in Incunabula (MEI) database. OwnershipTracker integrates bibliographic records, copy-specific data, and book provenance and ownership details, enabling users to uncover intricate ownership sequences over time. The application combines several visualization techniques, including network graphs to map connections between owners, timelines for temporal analysis, chord diagrams to quantify transfer patterns, and a distinctive, collaboratively designed spiderweb-like diagram highlighting converging and dispersing ownership transfers through specific owners. Developed iteratively with input from historical book researchers, the application underwent multiple refinements to align with domain research requirements. A summative evaluation with domain experts showcased the tool's ability to address the defined requirements and tasks.

    "abstract": "Spectrum analysis is widely used in the communication and radar areas, it plays a great role in ensuring the operational reliability of these systems. The traditional spectrum analysis method is based on analog mixing and digital fast Fourier transform (FFT), which has the problem of incompatibility between wide analysis bandwidth and high frequency resolution due to the bandwidth restriction of analog devices and operation speed of digital circuits. It is a challenge to achieve wideband spectrum analysis and high frequency resolution simultaneously for high sampling rate signals of tens of gigabit samples per second (GSPS). First, high-throughput is required to process the high sampling rate signals. Second, massive resource consumption is required to perform long-length FFT when high frequency resolution is required. To overcome these problems, a spectrum analysis structure based on high-speed acquisition and parallel hierarchical decimation filter is proposed. High speed acquisition provides wide Nyquist bandwidth, by processing the sampled signals in parallel way, wide analysis band can be achieved. Moreover, parallel decimation filter is designed to perform high-ratio decimation and anti-aliasing process, which is utilized to effectively improves the frequency resolution. A parallel feedforward cascaded integrator comb (PFCIC) method is proposed to improve the throughput of the decimation filter, and a reconstructed polyphase halfband (RPH) method is designed to reduce the resource consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that an analysis bandwidth of 8 GHz is achieved, and the maximal frequency resolution is 17 Hz. The designed PFCIC filter achieves a throughput of 20 GSPS, which is 2.7 times higher than the existing methods, and no multiplier resources are consumed. The multiplier resource consumption of the designed decimation filter based on the RPH method has been reduced by 75%."

    "abstract": "In massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems, circuit differences among power amplifiers (PAs) lead to poor nonlinear behavior consistency. This makes it difficult to linearize multiple PAs with shared digital predistortion (DPD). Pre-tuning circuit differences and improving circuit performance with low-power, low-cost analog devices is a desirable method. This article proposes a technology for the co-optimization of nonlinear behavior consistency and efficiency/linearity of PAs. This technology uses the passive adjustable mismatch network to fine-tune the load impedance of PAs. Two strategies are proposed for configuring network parameters. Their contribution is to achieve co-optimization, as well as fast selection of network parameters. In the theoretical part, a numerical model is presented to demonstrate the mechanism of tuning circuit differences. Based on simulation and test, the relationship between nonlinear behavior consistency, efficiency, and linearity, as well as the impact of circuit differences on them, is pointed out. At the same time, an efficient co-optimization method is proposed. The feasibility of this method is verified by numerical simulation and test of nine Doherty PAs from the same batch. In the test, when the shared DPD signal excites multiple PAs, the maximum improvement in adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is 7.73 dB; when the original signal excites multiple PAs, the maximum improvement in efficiency and normalized mean square error (NMSE) is 7.25% and 4.12 dB, respectively. In addition, this technology shows excellent adaptability in the dynamic carrier frequency range of 2340–2480 MHz."

First, a novel transposable 3T-1C eDRAM bitcell was presented, offering a reduced area footprint with respect to previously reported CIM bitcells. The proposed bitcell enhances energy efficiency by leveraging its compatibility with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) algorithm. Second, restoring-free access technique can be implemented through the instant weight-update operation, enabled by the read-calculate-write sequence in the learning operation. Third, to maximize the property of restoring-free accesses, a novel sense amplifier was employed, enhancing energy efficiency by 27% during the learning operation. Finally, a leaky integrate-and-fire bitline (LIF_BL) was proposed, eliminating the need for power-hungry ADCs by exploiting the characteristics of an SNN. The mixed-signal neuron model was implemented through a simple subtraction and counting method, increasing accuracy and energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "In the last decade, a variety of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with specific enhancements have been developed for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). In this article, unlike MOEAs, we provide a new artificial intelligence approach to solve MOPs, which adopts an imitation learning-based end-to-end method, namely AlphaMOEA. AlphaMOEA is entirely a model composed of neural networks that mainly follow the architecture of multitask learning (MTL). It has two training stages: the supervised learning (SL) stage and the reinforcement learning (RL) stage. In the SL stage, AlphaMOEA fits the solutions in the decision space provided by a number of selected MOEAs. Since neural networks in AlphaMOEA are composed of parameters with high dimensions, the fitting process can be viewed as a transformation of the solutions from a low-dimensional space into a high-dimensional space. This allows AlphaMOEA to obtain different valuable knowledge from a perspective of high dimensionality. Then, AlphaMOEA is trained in the RL stage to obtain good performance for MOPs with various problem characteristics in a self-driven manner. The RL stage relies on several designed components, including a similarity-based state design to measure the distance between solutions, an evolution operator-based action set to provide exploration behavior, and an indicator-guided reward to produce an incremental evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that AlphaMOEA can learn valuable information about the decision space in high-dimensional representations, thereby achieving a desirable balance between exploration and exploitation. AlphaMOEA can further improve the performance for solving MOPs with various problem characteristics in a reasonable time."

Determining the vibration receiving structure of vibration transmission and analyzing the sensitivity of its parameters can enable researchers to control the parameters with high sensitivity. In this paper, the time-varying meshing stiffness and error equivalent displacement generated during gear meshing are used as intrinsic excitations to systematically analyse the vibration-receiving structure of the encased differential planetary gear to reveal its dynamic characteristics and vibration response mechanism. The state equation of the encased differential planetary train is then used to create the first-order trajectory sensitivity model. The first-order trajectory sensitivity function amplitude is defined as the first sensitivity indicator S1, and the sensitivity change corresponding to the increase in the percentage of the parameter is defined as the peak sensitivity indicator S2 and the mean sensitivity indicator S3, respectively. Based on this, the sensitivity histograms of each parameter concerning the response of the vibration receiving mechanism under the three indicators are obtained. The results show that the sensitivity index of the system mesh damping parameter is much larger compared with the mesh stiffness parameter when the parameter unit value is changed, the peak sensitivity index and the mean sensitivity index have high similarity when the parameter percentage is changed."

Weakly-supervised methods using sample-level labels offer a scalable alternative and have gained traction, especially with the use of generative models for image synthesis and distribution learning. These models typically convert abnormal samples into healthy ones and identify anomalies via residuals, but they often miss disease-specific features and distort anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that disentangles anatomical and disease-related features using an encoder and reconstructs images with a conditional decoder, allowing precise control over both aspects. Our method achieves superior results on the BraTS2021 and MSLUB datasets, outperforming existing models in anomaly detection."

The hardware part of the system is centered on a high-speed camera equipped with a zoom lens and is equipped with a computer to form a complete monitoring unit. At the algorithmic level, firstly, based on the template matching fusion rhombus search strategy, the computation amount of each picture matching is reduced by a dozen times to dozens of times compared with the traditional global search, and secondly, the surface fitting method is adopted to realize the sub-pixel accuracy displacement resolution calculation. After MATLAB simulation verification, the proposed technique can realize accurate sub-pixel accuracy displacement measurement, with the advantages of high detection accuracy, fast speed and strong robustness. Field tests show that the method successfully captures the axial vibration signals of UHV transformer bushings, and its Fourier spectrum accurately analyzes the characteristic harmonic components such as 100Hz, 200Hz and 300Hz. Compared with the traditional detection methods, this technology can realize the long-distance, full-field, real-time online monitoring of UHV transformers, and provide a new way for intelligent substation equipment condition assessment."

Conversely, high-frequency SSVEP offers enhanced visual comfort but suffers from a lower SNR. In this study, we record and analyze 50 instances of high-frequency SSVEP at $\\mathbf{4 0 H z}$, varying optical parameters such as illuminance, color temperature, and light source area.

Additionally, we employee SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for interpretability analysis of the ML results.

Distance displacement correction is performed at any point in the scene relative to a reference point. Then, based on the residual range displacement, second -order phase errors, and their impact on imaging, the criteria for data block segmentation of airborne bistatic SAR echo data are determined. Finally, through simulation, the data block segmentation results for airborne bistatic SAR with different configurations are obtained.

    "abstract": "This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the influence of spatial configuration on the positioning performance of space-based bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR) satellites. Given the significance of Bistatic SAR systems in applications such as target recognition, ground moving target indication (GMTI), and digital elevation measurement (DEM), geometric positioning accuracy has emerged as a critical metric for evaluating system performance. The study initially establishes a Bistatic SAR earth observation modell, encompassing the range equation, Doppler equation, and Earth's ellipsoid model, thereby establishing a foundation for the subsequent analysis of positioning accuracy. Furthermore, this paper delineates and scrutinizes the impact of various error sources across the entire link on the geometric positioning accuracy of Bistatic SAR. These sources include the position and velocity measurement errors of the transmitting and receiving satellites, signal propagation delay errors, Doppler central frequency errors, and ground elevation errors. Through theoretical analysis and simulation calculations, this paper employs the LuTan-l satellite as the transmitting satellite to assess the geometric positioning accuracy of the Bistatic SAR system under different spatial configurations of the receiving satellite in the same orbit. It also discusses the impact of different error sources on positioning accuracy. The research findings suggest that elevation errors have a substantial impact on positioning accuracy, followed by signal propagation delay errors and Doppler central frequency errors. Additionally, the study reveals that when the target point is in the direct lateral view and the oblique side view of the transmitting satellite, the difference in the mean anomaly angle between the receiving satellite and the transmitting satellite has minimal effect on positioning accuracy. Furthermore, the farther the target point is from the transmitting satellite, the poorer the positioning accuracy becomes. The accuracy of the theoretical model is further corroborated through simulation analysis, offering invaluable insights for the subsequent design and optimization of Bistatic SAR systems."

    "abstract": "In response to the complex dispatching demands of new energy bases under the new power system, this study designs a multi-dimensional data statistical analysis method for a multi-energy complementary integrated dispatching system based on energy internet theory and system optimization theory. This method achieves coordinated dispatching of multiple energy forms such as wind, solar, hydro, thermal, and storage by constructing a full-chain analysis system covering data modeling, functional application, and visualization display. Specifically, it establishes a three-level statistical model for annual, monthly, and daily time dimensions, and a three-layer analysis framework for base-level, resource-level, and station-level spatial dimensions. Data quality is ensured through data cleaning, standardized conversion, and distributed storage technologies. Five core functions, including power generation statistics and real-time load monitoring, are realized using cumulative algorithms and confidence interval analysis.Empirical analysis shows that after applying this method at the Qinghai Delingha New Energy Base, the wind curtailment rate dropped from 15% to 5%, the solar curtailment rate dropped from 12% to 3%, the overall energy utilization efficiency increased by 13 percentage points, and the dispatching decision response time was shortened by 40%, validating the scientific and engineering practicality of the method."

This paper introduces a unified GNN-Transformer architecture leveraging FLAME 3D facial landmarks and dynamic emotion modeling for multidimensional engagement analysis. Our approach processes 5,023 vertices from FLAME blendshapes through graph attention networks to capture spatial relationships, while transformer encoders model temporal engagement dynamics. A novel cross-modal attention mechanism fuses spatial-temporal representations to jointly predict behavioral engagement, affective states, and cognitive load. The central idea introduced in this work is the development of a deep learning pipeline that integrates FLAME-based 3D facial dynamics with a joint GNN-Transformer and cross-modal attention framework to enable accurate, robust, and simultaneous, physiologically-grounded prediction of multiple diverse student engagement dimensions. Validated on the DAD-3DHeads dataset, our method demonstrates strong generalization and performance in real-world classroom scenarios, offering significant improvements over conventional 2D approaches through its physiologically-grounded 3D representation."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the efficiency of an electric vehicle powertrain using both 2-level and 3-level voltage source inverters. A brushless electrically excited synchronous machine (EESM) is used as the traction motor, and the comparison is conducted across a wide range of operating conditions. The motor’s copper losses were found to be nearly identical under both inverter topologies. However, the core losses were significantly lower when operating with the 3-level inverter. This reduction is attributed to the decreased harmonic content in the machine’s line current, which is a characteristic advantage of the 3-level topology. On the inverter side, the 2-level topology exhibited lower losses compared to the 3-level, primarily due to the fewer switching devices involved. When evaluating the overall system efficiency, including both the motor and the inverter, the 3-level inverter demonstrated slightly higher powertrain efficiency across most of the operating range, with the exception of low-speed regions where the 2-level inverter showed marginally better performance."

    "abstract": "Transmission systems are typically employed in industrial scenarios characterized by high loads, prolonged continuous operation, or complex environmental interference. Under such conditions, internal sensors are prone to faults such as stuck, constant deviation, constant gain, and mutation faults during long-term operation. These faults can distort monitoring data and pose significant threats to system reliability. To address the limitations of traditional methods in isolating faults under high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamic data and concurrent multi-type failures, this paper proposes a sensor fault isolation method that integrates a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE), attention mechanism, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Specifically, the CAE is first employed to autonomously extract spatiotemporal features from sensor time-series data through unsupervised learning. Then, an attention mechanism is incorporated to dynamically enhance critical fault-related features while suppressing noise, thereby significantly improving feature discriminability. Finally, the SVM is utilized for precise classification and isolation of sensor faults owing to its strong nonlinear decision capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 0.96 in detecting typical faults of pressure, temperature, and rotational speed sensors. Compared to mainstream models such as CNN, SVM, and LSTM, the proposed method improves accuracy by 3.4% to 19.5%, exhibiting clear advantages in both detection accuracy and robustness. This approach offers an effective solution for sensor fault isolation in transmission systems operating under complex conditions."

However, medical images often exhibit complex structures, blurred boundaries, and unevenly distributed tiny targets, which pose greater challenges for segmentation models. To address the task of automatic recognition and detection of auricular reflex zones, this paper proposes an improved medical image segmentation model—MultiResUNet-DPDA. Based on the traditional MultiResUNet, the proposed model introduces dilated convolutions to expand the receptive field, employs ASPP to enhance both global and local feature extraction capabilities, and integrates cross-layer features to optimize semantic transmission in skip connections. Additionally, the ECA attention mechanism is incorporated in the decoder stage to strengthen key feature responses. A combined loss function-DiceCE Loss-that integrates Dice Loss and CrossEntropy Loss is also designed to improve boundary recognition and fine-grained segmentation.The model is evaluated using mIoU, mean accuracy (MA), and F1 score. Experimental results show that compared to YOLOv11, UNet, and MultiResUNet, the proposed model improves mIoU by $12.69 \\%, 4.83 \\%$, and $1.38 \\%$, respectively. These improvements demonstrate enhanced boundary modeling, small object recognition, and generalization in complex backgrounds, validating the model’s superior segmentation performance and application potential."

These constraints are a type of global constraint that have been effectively handled in constraint programming (CP), but remain challenging for SAT-based approaches. Instead of encoding each “at least” cardinality constraint individually, our method encodes sets of these constraints by creating reusable encoding blocks and systematically linking adjacent blocks. This block-based strategy leads to more compact encoding and improves the solver performance for problems with sequence constraints. We evaluated our approach through an experiment on the Nurse Rostering problem. The results demonstrate that our SAT encoding consistently surpasses existing methods in terms of solving time and encoding size. Our work highlights the potential of SATbased techniques for effectively addressing sequence constraints and introduces new possibilities for SAT modeling of sequence constraints."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a thermal modeling-based virtual power plant (VPP) dispatch method for central air conditioning systems. Initially, by leveraging the thermal inertia characteristics of air conditioning systems, a virtual energy storage model is constructed to decouple electrical power from cooling load demand. This enables central air conditioning systems to rapidly respond to grid dispatch while maintaining user comfort. Subsequently, a three-tier control architecture comprising dispatch, management, and user layers is established. A two-stage control strategy is implemented for edge terminals: global optimization pre-sets chilled water temperature parameters, while local optimization dynamically adjusts terminal fan power. Finally, targeting grid peak-shaving scenarios, a virtual generation unit (VGU) screening mechanism based on capacity reserve and response duration is proposed to optimize resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the grid interaction capabilities of air conditioning loads, validating the feasibility of aggregating central air conditioning systems as virtual energy storage units for peak-shaving services."

    "abstract": "Intelligent diagnostic algorithms based on deep learning have opened up a new way for rolling bearing fault diagnosis and the effect is obvious, but it is undeniable that most of the research now focuses on the homologous data (i.e., the same working conditions, the same equipment). However, considering the normal working scenarios in actual workshops and factories, the difficulty of implementing intelligent diagnostic algorithms will increase, because in workshops and factories, working conditions and equipment change frequently, and it is difficult to realize the training of intelligent diagnostic algorithms with the same source of data. And in some cases, the collected data is difficult to be labeled resulting in insufficient labels, which requires the intelligent diagnostic algorithm to be able to diagnose faults under different working conditions and equipment. To address the above factors, this research designs a Two-Way One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2C-1DCNN) based on transfer learning (TL) technique with a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and an Attention mechanism (Attention) combined fault diagnosis model (2C-1DCNN-BiGRU-Attention). The model can be directly input the vibration signals of the captured bearings and pre-trained using the source domain data, followed by using the Multiple Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) to measure the feature distribution distance between the layers of the network in the source and target domains, to determine the migrating and freezing layers of the model, and finally, using a small amount of labeled target domain data for re-training to complete the task of classifying the target domain fault data. labeled target domain data for re-training to complete the task of classifying the fault data in the target domain. After experimental verification, the algorithm has a high diagnostic accuracy and effectively solves the problem of increased difficulty in diagnosing faults in the target domain due to the different distribution of data in the target domain and the source domain and the fact that there is only a very small amount of labeled data due to the difficulty in labeling the data."

Thus, it has been used in many industries and applications, including cryptocurrency, finance, smart cities, healthcare, and manufacturing. However, blockchain suffers from scalability issues and provides low transaction throughput and high latency. Sharding is used to solve these scalability and performance issues by dividing the blockchain network into smaller clusters of nodes called shards, and each shard processes transactions in parallel. However, the sharding protocol is still in its early stages and encounters multiple challenges. In this paper, we survey cutting-edge blockchain sharding papers, mainly focusing on transaction processing aspects such as intra-shard transaction processing, cross-shard communication, and cross-shard transaction processing. We also examine security vulnerabilities and attack vectors associated with sharded blockchain systems.

The controller maximizes control bandwidth while ensuring stability across a wide range of configurations. Experimental validation on a FJR demonstrates superior tracking accuracy, vibration suppression, and robustness compared to model-based methods. Furthermore, a high-speed drumming task demonstrates the ability of the controller to handle repeated impacts and inertia variations, highlighting the potential of FRF-based control for the fast and precise operation of flexible robotic systems."

Indeed, it is now well understood that highly-distributed AI outside the cloud is a necessity in view of the infeasibility of raw data transmission to the cloud, latency challenges, data deluge and network bottleneck, high consumption of continuous wireless streaming, and privacy sensitivities. As a remarkable convergence, highly-distributed AI will also help address the daunting challenge posed by the ludicrously high levels of power consumption that next-generation datacenters are expected to require. In this talk, intriguing trends and brand new technologies from our Green IC group at NUS are illustrated to show how (incredibly) pervasive AI can be, while simultaneously addressing environmental and energy sustainability challenges.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, secure and efficient cross-domain information sharing has become essential. Traditional cross-domain authentication approaches that rely on real device identities pose significant privacy risks, while fully anonymous schemes often lack accountability for malicious behavior. Additionally, emerging quantum computing capabilities threaten the security of classical cryptographic systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a post-quantum secure, traceable anonymous cross-domain authentication scheme based on blockchain technology. The scheme incorporates lattice-based certificateless cryptography and quantum-resistant hash functions to ensure resilience against quantum attacks. Devices are assigned multiple unlinkable pseudonymous identities with corresponding post-quantum public-private key pairs. A dynamic accumulator is employed to update domain information, and distinct pseudonyms are used for each authentication. Cross-domain credentials issued by a key generation center enable identity verification without exposing real identities. The system ensures both device privacy and traceability of malicious actors. Formal security proofs and BAN logic analysis confirm the scheme’s robustness against classical and quantum-era threats. Compared with existing classical approaches, the proposed scheme achieves strong post-quantum security with reduced computational and communication overhead during the authentication process."

    "abstract": "The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology in the internet of vehicles (IoV) domain, particularly due to its rapid advancements. However, as IoV networks expand, they encounter numerous challenges, including the increased communication traffic, ele vated communication latency, and insufficient sensing capabilities in critical emergency scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (Multi-UAV) assisted ISAC framework that synergistically combines the UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) and radar sensing technologies. This framework allows for a comprehensive investigation into the interactions among sensing, communication and computation through a joint optimization approach. First, to achieve a balance between communication performance, economic expenditure and radar mutual information (MI), we propose a Cobb-Douglas utility function and integrate it with a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which jointly takes the access control, instance selection, task offloading, UAV transmit power, and computational resource into consideration. Second, we reformulate this mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem as a markov decision process (MDP), and then propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based resource allocation algorithm, which focuses on the simultaneous improvement of both communication quality and sensing accuracy. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm markedly outperforms the existing baseline algorithms, achieving reductions of 73% in processing delay and 44% in total cost. This work not only fills a critical gap in current UAV-assisted IoV networks but also sets a foundation for future research into integrated sensing and communication systems in large-scale vehicular networks."

    "abstract": "The risk of atherosclerosis increases with age and existing diagnostic methods are expensive and complex, requiring effective, convenient and rapid screening methods in modern medical practice. In this study, we designed an arterial stiffness assessment method based on a Backpropagation Neural Network and integrated it into a portable radial pulse detection system. Pulse signals were acquired from 232 healthy volunteers and 28 hypertensive patients using a self-designed three-probe portable device. Healthy individuals were grouped by age, and five time-domain features positively correlated with age were screened out: main wave angle, pulse duration, rise time, systolic peak amplitude, and pulse contour area. Subsequently, an established was used to compute arterial elasticity reference values for all volunteers. Using the aforementioned five time-domain features as inputs and computed arterial elasticity reference values of healthy individuals as targets, we developed a BP neural network-based model for arterial elasticity assessment. The prediction accuracy of the trained model on the test set reached 93.13%. Local PWV(Pulse Wave Velocity) and radial artery AI(Augmentation Index) were used to validate the prediction results, with correlation coefficients reaching r = -0.71 (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.001) and r = -0.63 (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.001), respectively. Given that the vascular system of hypertensive patients is chronically subjected to elevated hemodynamic load, often resulting in impaired arterial elasticity, this model was clinically validated in a hypertensive cohort. The evaluation results are generally consistent with hypertension grading and comorbidity distribution, and the degree of agreement is higher than that of the reference method, confirming its utility in detecting hypertension-driven arterial stiffening progression."

Cheating, particularly in first-person shooter (FPS) games, can lead to substantial losses for the game industry. Existing anti-cheat solutions have limitations, such as client-side hardware constraints, security risks, server-side unreliable methods, and both-sides suffer from a lack of comprehensive real-world datasets. To address these limitations, the paper proposes HAWK, a server-side FPS anti-cheat framework for the popular game CS:GO. HAWK utilizes machine learning techniques to mimic human experts’ identification process, leverages novel multi-view features, and is equipped with a well-defined workflow. HAWK is evaluated with the first large and real-world datasets containing multiple cheat types and cheating sophistication, and it exhibits promising efficiency and acceptable overheads, shorter ban times, higher recall and similar false positive rate compared to the in-use anti-cheat, and the ability to capture cheaters who evaded official inspections."

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-based agents offer powerful natural language understanding for smart home intent interpretation but typically require cloud deployment, raising concerns over privacy, latency, and resource usage. While sLLM can run on-device, they lack the structured contextual knowledge needed to handle ambiguous intents and complex device interactions effectively. To address this limitation, we present CIDER, an ontology-augmented, on-device intent reasoning framework that combines an sLLM with common-sense device knowledge and user-specific context, organized within a structured ontology-based knowledge graph. Specifically, we develop an ontology construction pipeline for smart homes, which leverages cloud-based LLMs to extract and organize common-sense knowledge about smart home devices and integrates user-specific context from a smart home service. The resulting ontology serves as an external knowledge source that augments the sLLM’s intent reasoning process in a retrieval-augmented manner, enabling context-aware inference for autonomous, orchestrated device operation. In evaluations with SmartThings-based testbeds, CIDER achieves a success rate of 82.2% in general scenarios and 76.6% in highly complex home environments, outperforming strong cloud-based baselines by up to 17.7 percentage points, despite relying on a compact on-device sLLM. These results demonstrate that combining the domain-specific efficiency of symbolic knowledge representations with the flexible semantic processing of an sLLM, empowered by an ontology distilled from cloud-based LLMs, provides an effective approach to intent understanding in smart homes."

    "abstract": "Distributed, high-density neural implants enable multi-region, high-fidelity neural recording and targeted stimulation, advancing both the treatment of neurological disorders and the development of brain–machine interfaces. While recent uplink transmitters (TXs) have achieved high data rates, high energy efficiency, and mm-scale footprints suitable for distributed systems, they struggle to maintain a balanced performance across these metrics. This article introduces a mm-scale wireless TX to overcome this limitation. To support high-density neural recording with flexible channel counts and various signal modalities, the TX offers energy-efficient data transmission from 50 Mb/s to 1.2 Gb/s, enabled by a novel dual-modulation technique. At high data rates, the TX employs a hybrid modulation scheme combining 4-PPM and 2-PSK, while at low data rates, it switches to simple on-off keying (OOK) modulation. To enable this modulation strategy, we introduce a twin-oscillator-based wideband phase-locked loop (PLL) for RF carrier generation within the ultra-wideband (UWB) range. At high data rates, the PLL directly generates a low-jitter UWB carrier. At low data rates, leveraging OOK modulation’s relaxed phase noise requirements, a duty-cycled <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5{\\times }$</tex-math> </inline-formula> frequency multiplier upconverts the PLL’s low output frequency to the UWB band. This approach bypasses the power-hungry RF oscillators and dividers, facilitating energy-efficient, duty-cycled carrier generation and supporting frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). In addition, we employ a hybrid strategy combining time-division multiple access (TDMA) and FDMA to enhance scalability for untethered, distributed neural implants. A custom on-chip antenna replaces the conventional printed circuit board (PCB) antenna, establishing a wireless link between the implant and the external system. The proposed TX, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, occupies a compact footprint of only 3 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and consumes 1.49–7.26 mW across all supported data rates (50–1200 Mb/s).

Second, a human-in-the-loop mechanism is integrated with gesture prediction technology, enabling the non-autonomous leader to receive control commands through a gesture recognition system, while the followers are indirectly controlled via the communication network, thereby enhancing the naturalness of the UAVs' response to commands. Moreover, this paper incorporates dynamic surface control to overcome the complexity explosion problem in controller design, ensuring the stability of the system.

    "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) on IoT data is pivotal for developing intelligent industrial systems. This involves using a sliding window to extract time slices for ML prediction models. Existing methods rely on empirical, statistical, and optimisation or heuristic-based approaches to determine optimal sliding window size. Recent deep learning methods adaptively adjust or internally restructure windows, but they do not explicitly predict window size as a supervised target, particularly in multivariate IIoT contexts. In this paper, we introduce GDRNet, a novel deep learning-based approach for dynamically determining the optimal sliding window size to achieve improved prediction accuracy in multivariate Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. The generative component (G) of GDRNet employs an LSTM-based variational autoencoder model to generate a large labeled multivariate dataset. The deep regression (DR) component employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that is trained offline and predicts common optimal sliding window online. Unlike transformer-based or self-supervised forecasting models that assume large fixed contexts, GDRNet frames sliding window determination as a regression problem, enabling explicit and efficient prediction of optimal window sizes. Through extensive experimentation with multiple machine learning models and real-world IIoT datasets, we demonstrate that GDRNet achieves competitive or superior prediction accuracy with substantially higher computational efficiency and scalability as compared to the traditional methods, making it suitable for online IIoT systems. We also establish the generalisability of GDRNet through applying it across three real world IIoT datasets of different domains and contexts."

Existing environmental testing standards demonstrate limitations in simulating multi-stress coupled scenarios due to insufficient simulation capabilities and outdated control strategies. This paper proposes an ultra-high altitude adaptability testing methodology for power transmission sensing terminals based on multidimensional environmental coupling loading and dynamic gradient control. Through retrofitting a comprehensive test chamber with integrated ultraviolet irradiation, air circulation, and low-pressure control modules, we established a synchronized multi-environmental factor loading system. The implementation of a pressure-temperature-ultraviolet linkage algorithm coupled with a dynamic gradient control model enables precise simulation of altitude gradient variations. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in replicating multidimensional extreme conditions: low pressure (≤70 kPa), intense ultraviolet radiation (≥1000 W/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>), wide temperature fluctuations (-40°C to 70°C), and strong winds (≥15 m/s), while significantly reducing testing cycle duration.

Since the time-domain voltage and current data are difficult to reflect the changes in the characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, this paper proposes a RUL prediction method for lithium-ion batteries based on the integration of time convolution network (TCN) and long-term and short-term memory model (LSTM) based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS). Bayes optimization algorithm based on tree structure is used to select the super parameters of the model. The TCN network is used to automatically extract the aging characteristics of lithium-ion batteries from the impedance data. The LSTM network is used to capture the long-term and short-term dependencies in the time series of lithium-ion batteries, and the final life prediction is carried out through the full connection layer. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on TPE-TCN-LSTM model can not only accurately grasp the overall degradation trend of the battery, but also quickly capture and respond to the fluctuations, so as to effectively improve the prediction performance."

We use foreign exchange market data, including opening, high, low, and closing prices (OHLC). To refine the analysis, we optimized the ARDL model using the Grid Search algorithm to identify the best parameters for the model. Additionally, we applied these optimal lag combinations to interpretable machine learning such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Gradient Boosting. The results reveal that a stable exchange rate promotes exports (+8.06 billion USD) while reducing imports (-9.24 billion USD). A 1 MAD appreciation decreases exports by 3.84 billion USD and increases imports by 4.60 billion USD, while a depreciation reduces exports by 3.78 billion USD and increases imports by 3.75 billion USD. Additionally, a 1% increase in imports leads to a 0.69% increase in exports and Exports itself exert a strong influence on imports (+134.10%), The machine learning (ML) models provide further insights into this nexus, by capturing complex and non-linear relationships that ARDL could not handle.

    "abstract": "The performance and safety of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) critically depend on dynamic structural and interfacial changes within constituent materials (electrodes, electrolyte, separator) during electrochemical cycling. Understanding the evolution of microstructures and interfaces—particularly as functions of State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) is essential for advancing Battery Management Systems (BMS). This study introduces a novel non-destructive method for inspecting LIB material properties using active acoustic interrogation and spectral analysis. The approach transmits swept-frequency acoustic waves into both parametrically designed 3D-printed samples (with controlled microstructural variations) and operational pouch-cell LIBs, analyzing the resulting acoustic emissions. Extracted spectral features reveal distinct correlations with specific material conditions in both sample types and pouch cells. These findings establish a frequency-domain framework for precise battery diagnostics, enabling potential visualization of dynamic material-property evolution throughout charge-discharge cycles."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an intelligent monitoring system for transmission line sag based on 77GHz millimeter-wave radar is proposed, which solves the key problem of insufficient arc sag measurement accuracy in complex environments through multidisciplinary theoretical innovation and algorithm optimization. The system adopts 4GHz bandwidth FMCW radar, which achieves an arc sag measurement accuracy of 0.1m (theoretical resolution of 0.0375m) and an angular resolution of 0.125° under the conditions of 300m range, -10°C and 10mm icing, which is 46% higher than the existing technology. The temperature-icing joint compensation model was innovatively proposed, which reduced the sag calculation error from >12% to <1.5% in extreme environments (-40°C 30mm ice). The dynamic equation of wind vibration-sag is established, and the vibration and noise are suppressed by 80% (±0.2m→±0.05m) through Kalman filtering, the response time is < 50ms, and the real-time monitoring refresh rate of 20Hz is realized. The verification shows that the system can ≥ 30 minutes in advance to warn the risk of sag overrun (± 10% safety threshold), provide ≥ 2-hour early warning (detection accuracy ±1mm) when the icing > is 5mm, and reduce manual inspection by 70% (saving 560,000 yuan per year for a single line). The multi-objective separation algorithm successfully distinguishes the 1.5° interval target points, and the four-dimensional visualization platform integrates distance-velocity spectrum, catenary shape, dynamic sag curve and icing impact analysis to provide minute-level risk decision support for smart grids. This technology has passed the test of 12 strong winds and - 40°C extreme cold, providing an innovative solution for the safe operation of high-voltage/ultra-high-voltage transmission lines."

High-quality and intact meteorological and hydrological data enable precise modeling of hydrological processes, which facilitates early warning systems that help protect communities from the devastating impacts of extreme weather events. However, missing data is common in hydrological time series, especially in long-term observations of rainfall and river levels, and can significantly reduce modeling accuracy and decision-making quality. Therefore, a suitable method is required to process the data effectively. This study compared three imputation techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Interpolation, and Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). The dataset used in this study consists of daily rainfall and river discharge data from the Citarum River, covering the period from 2015 to 2023. The performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with a complete reference dataset. Results show that Linear Interpolation has better performance than other methods with 10.359 MAE and 18.086 RMSE, meanwhile, KNN and MICE have 17.312 and 16.936 MAE and 34.706 and 34.778 RMSE. The result shows the Linear Interpolation can handle missing values of the dataset and produces lower errors."

Consequently, a well-planned capacity configuration for ZCHMS is critical to boost its economic viability. In this study, we propose a novel planning strategy for ZCHMS, which aims at maximizing profitability. Detailed models of the energy and mass balance, as well as the operational characteristics of the shaft furnace, are developed.

    "abstract": "System security is an important issue in the contemporary digital era and continues to be a key area of interest for the global research community. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates the STBC encoding scheme with Beamforming technology to enhance physical layer security in next-generation networks. In the proposed method, the conventional Alamouti STBC patterns are modified into 16 alternative orthogonal patterns by rearranging the positions and signs of complex signal components, while preserving the benefits of traditional STBC scheme. At each transmission instance, one pattern is selected based on the Channel State Information (CSI) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. These values are exchanged via beacon packets prior to data transmission and are unknown to eavesdroppers, allowing the RSSI value to serve as a shared secret key. This dynamic and random pattern selection complicates interception, thereby strengthening system security. After STBC encoding, Beamforming is applied using available CSI to adjust the phase and amplitude across transmit antennas, directing the signal energy toward the legitimate receiver. Simulation and analytical results show that the proposed method maintains a low bit error rate (BER) for the legitimate receiver, while significantly increasing the BER for eavesdroppers, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving physical layer security. Furthermore, the secrecy rate of the proposed method is significantly higher than that of conventional Beamforming and STBC scheme."

This study develops a lap time prediction methodology grounded in optimal control theory by establishing a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) double-track vehicle dynamics model coupled with track constraints and nonlinear programming techniques. The minimum-lap-time optimal control problem is reformulated as a nonlinear programming problem and numerically resolved using the CasADi framework with the IPOPT solver, enabling systematic evaluation of track width, wheelbase, and front-to-rear axle load distribution on figure-eight skid pad performance. Results indicate that the proposed computational approach demonstrates a 10% deviation from empirical performance data yet effectively captures performance trends. A track width of 1,240 mm yields the shortest lap time (4.590 s), achieving a 1.6% improvement over the baseline configuration. Optimal steering agility emerges at a 1,580 mm wheelbase with a lap time of 4.557 s, while a 40% front axle load ratio facilitates the fastest lap (4.547s) through controlled oversteer strategies. These findings reveal the underlying mechanisms through which dimensional parameters govern figure-eight maneuverability, providing theoretical guidance for parameter optimization in FSAE vehicle design."

However, traditional methods often rely on manual experience and static scheduling rules, lacking dynamic optimization mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an LLM-Agent and knowledge graph-integrated framework for collaborative optimization of hydropower maintenance resources scheduling. First, an LLM-assisted approach is employed to construct a maintenance knowledge graph. Then, a query-aware subgraph retrieval method is designed to extract relevant triplets by identifying core entities in user queries and leveraging semantic alignment strategies for multi-hop subgraph retrieval. Subsequently, a three-stage resource allocation generation mechanism based on prompt engineering is proposed. This mechanism utilizes the retrieved knowledge subgraphs to guide the generation of diverse and structured maintenance plans. Finally, an LLM-Agent-based optimization module, incorporating a genetic algorithm, is developed to dynamically manage resource constraints and reduce costs across multiple planning alternatives. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the efficiency of maintenance resource allocation, offering a novel paradigm for advancing the intelligent hydropower equipment maintenance."

The experiment uses a combination of envelope spectrum analysis and motor current RMS value monitoring to extract and analyze the characteristic frequency of failures caused by artificially manufactured bearing outer ring defects. The results show that as the tightness of the assembly decreases or the degree of unevenness of the preload increases, the frequency of failure shifts to varying degrees, and the motor load changes significantly, reflecting the dynamic evolution of rolling-to-sliding friction. The research verifies the inherent coupling relationship between the signal characteristics and the assembly state, which provides an important reference for the online monitoring of the bearing state of RV reducer and the evaluation of assembly quality."

The Lotus Bridge framework addresses these by proposing a hybrid digital identity architecture suitable for national-scale deployment. It integrates a permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain for sovereign credential issuance with a cross-chain verification bridge that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to enable privacy-preserving selective disclosure. This architecture is one of the first to combine state-backed issuance with interoperable, private cross-chain verification in a unified system. Two core protocols—state-anchored issuance and cross-chain verification—are formally defined and implemented in a working prototype. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance: cryptographic proofs remain under 600 bytes and end-to-end verification latency consistently stays below 2 seconds, enabling real-time applicability. Additionally, parallelization reduces proof generation time by over 90%, and the system achieves significant cost efficiency, with on-chain verification starting at 244 Gwei per credential and scaling to 14K Gwei for 1,000, offering up to 75% cost savings compared to existing Ethereum and Polygon solutions. These findings establish Lotus Bridge as a scalable and costeffective foundation for sovereign digital identity in cross-chain ecosystems."

    "abstract": "To address the issue of insufficient SCR caused by the integration of a high proportion of renewable energy into weak grids, this paper proposes an approach to enhance the SCR for renewable power plants based on virtual synchronous generator control. Firstly, the SCR metric for the renewable station is calculated in real-time, and a subset of grid-connected converters is configured with virtual synchronous control. Subsequently, the equivalent impedance at the PCC is adjusted by dynamically regulating the virtual impedance, thereby reducing the system's critical short-circuit ratio requirement. Finally, during voltage dips at the PCC, a virtual excitation mechanism is employed to deliver quick voltage support, consequently improving the system's equivalent short-circuit ratio. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the SCR of renewable energy stations and significantly strengthens the grid's disturbance resistance capability."

Existing models typically focus on classification or regression tasks within a single domain, limiting their generalization ability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified multi-task learning framework based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture and adversarial domain training. The model integrates multiple expert networks with dynamic gating mechanisms to extract discriminative features from various signal modalities, enabling effective fault classification. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cross-device fault diagnosis accuracy. This work highlights the potential of combining modular sparse representations with adversarial domain adaptation to build scalable and transferable prognostic health management (PHM) models for industrial rotating machinery."

This paper presents a new Composite Cost Metric (CCM) which improves energy-efficient routing performance in combined UAV-satellite constellations. We consider incorporating cumulative Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) and residual energy into the route selection process for both proactive and reactive protocols, our approach refines the routing decisions of classical protocols. The proposed CCM-driven modifications and protocol-specific integration typologies can improve overall route stability, reduce energy consumption per delivered packet, and optimize network reliability by dynamically selecting relays with lower attenuation and higher energy availability. We develop an NS-3-based simulation framework that integrates realistic satellite orbital mechanics, UAV mobility models, and a hybrid energy model that includes solar energy harvesting for satellites. Simulation results demonstrate that our enhancements can indeed outperform baseline implementations in packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, and end-to-end delay which makes them viable for next-generation NTN-supported 6G networks, at the expense of some additional control overhead. With this set of developments we aim to pave the way for global-optimum and energy-aware emergency and disaster relief communications."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classi f ication, but their complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we propose Perturbation free Local Explanation (PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from the LLM and a “Siamese network” style neural network trained to align with feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence. We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks (sentiment, fake news, fake COVID 19 news and depression), showing more than 92% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a “stress test” reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution for explainable LLM-based text classification."

    "abstract": "In the realm of skeleton-based human action recognition, the traditional methods which rely on coarse body keypoints fall short of capturing subtle human actions. In this work, we propose Expressive Keypoints that incorporates hand and foot details to form a fine-grained skeletal representation, to improve the discriminative ability for existing models in discerning intricate human actions. However, the increased computational cost from processing nearly three times more joints becomes a new challenge. To address this, we present the Progressive Skeleton Evolution strategy, which significantly improves efficiency while preserving the benefits of fine-grained keypoints. The core idea involves utilizing learnable mapping matrices, semantically initialized to progressively downsample keypoints and prioritize prominent joints by allocating importance weights. Additionally, a plug-and-play Instance Pooling module is exploited to extend our approach to multi-person scenarios without surging computation cost. Extensive experimental results over seven datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-arts for skeleton-based human action recognition.

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying B-lines and pleural line (P-line) in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos is valuable for evaluating certain lung conditions. However, manual interpretation remains subjective and highly dependent on operator expertise. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from performance degradation due to speckle noise and motion artifacts. Moreover, the limited availability of LUS video data annotated for multiple diagnostic features such as B-lines and the P-line limits model development. Therefore, this paper introduces ILD-LUS, a new clinical LUS database designed based on interstitial lung disease (ILD) analysis by category labeling, comprising 2,149 ultrasound videos (193,410 frames). Also, we construct an external test set based on the public Covid-BLUES dataset for the evaluation of B-lines and P-line recognition in different pulmonary pathologies. Then, we propose a novel video analysis framework that integrates wavelet enhancement with temporal attention modeling. Specifically, we employ a dual-component frequency feature enhancement method using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which effectively suppresses noise while preserving important landmarks. Subsequently, an adaptive attention module is introduced to model long-range temporal dependencies and improve dynamic feature representation across consecutive frames. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves over 94% AUC and 82% ACC for both B-lines and P-line classification on both the ILD-LUS and Covid-BLUES datasets, outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our approach across different pathological conditions. Overall, the proposed framework shows strong potential for supporting clinical decision-making in LUS analysis.

As ITS relies increasingly on multi-source data for decision-making, new challenges arise in terms of secure data integration, user privacy protection, and communication latency. Most current UAV optimization methods only look at certain things, including planning the flight path or scheduling resources. However, these solutions don’t have a way to optimize all of these important parameters at the same time, which leads to higher latency and energy use. We suggest a secure and privacy-preserving multi-UAV optimization technique based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) to solve these problems. This algorithm jointly optimizes UAV trajectories, resource scheduling, and task allocation in a multi-UAV and multi-edge servers system to reduce energy consumption and system latency while preserving user data privacy. A blockchain-based mechanism is added to make UAV data even more secure and open by recording task execution records in a way that can’t be changed. The proposed approach works, as shown by the outcomes of the experiments. The proposed solution cuts down on system latency and energy use by a lot compared to current optimization methods, even when the system is under a lot of stress or needs to keep data private."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technology continues to advance, an increasing number of platforms are integrating AI into their agricultural investments to manage pests and diseases. However, the complexity of AI application may increase the planting costs for farms. Meanwhile, platforms building their own farms is becoming a common practice in agriculture. This study presents a contract farming supply chain involving a platform and a farmer, where the platform resells the farmer's products and introduces its own farm's products as competitors. Unlike improving consumer utility, AI is developed to increase agricultural yields in this study. We use game theory to analyze and compare three AI technology policies of the platform: no AI, only developing AI in the self-built farm, and sharing AI with the farmer. Results show that the platform benefits from AI and shares the technology only if AI technology increases the efficiency of agricultural planting or slightly reduces it. Interestingly, the higher the AI technology effect, the less likely the farmer is to accept AI sharing policy. Additionally, when the farmer accepts it, the higher its efficacy, the less advantageous it may become. Through extended analysis, we find that these conclusions are stable regardless of whether the platform charges technology fees to the farmer or whether the role of AI is restricted. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of AI technology policies for platforms in agricultural production."

    "abstract": "Instant delivery has become an essential service in daily life, requiring strict delivery timelines. However, traditional delivery methods that employ human couriers struggle to meet the soaring delivery demands due to labor shortages. While researchers have explored alternative solutions using ground vehicles (e.g., crowdsourced taxis) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), their inherent limitations, such as constrained delivery detour for crowdsourced taxis and limited battery capacity of UAVs, greatly constrain their effectiveness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel air-ground delivery paradigm that cooperatively integrates UAVs and crowdsourced taxis. First, UAV stations are strategically deployed based on delivery gaps between the delivery demands and taxis' delivery capacity, instead of delivery demands only; Then, a predictive UAV repositioning strategy is designed to bridge instantaneously dynamic delivery gaps. Thereafter, a transfer learning-based (TL-based) algorithm that mines the delivery knowledge of human couriers is designed to optimize the cooperative performance. This algorithm extracts behavioral insights from human couriers and transfers them to enhance the delivery capabilities of UAVs and taxis. Finally, parcel assignment is formulated as optimization problems aimed at maximizing total preferences of UAVs and taxis, and maximizing delivery number while minimizing cost, respectively. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method delivers 27.4% more parcels, saves 19.2% delivery cost, and preserves 36.3% more of the travel experience of taxi passengers than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) air-ground cooperative approach for instant delivery."

    "abstract": "Lower-limb amputees worldwide have been increasing continuously in recent years. Hydraulic knees are suitable for active transfemoral amputees in developing countries due to their adaptability to various walking speeds and greater accessibility compared to high-end prosthetics. However, most hydraulic prosthetic knees operate via ground reaction force control, which exhibits a double-peak characteristic, causing slight flexion during the early stance phase, leading to unnatural and asymmetrical gait patterns for amputees. This study proposes a novel technique that expands the concept of the two-axis for application in a hydraulic prosthetic knee, utilizing the control moment to achieve stance-phase control (CMSPC knee). The control moment exhibits only one positive peak during the stance phase, allowing for adjustment of suitable stance-phase knee flexion by varying the spring stiffness. The single-subject walking experiment was conducted in the gait laboratory with one transfemoral amputee to evaluate the conceptual design. The subject walked on a treadmill at a constant velocity of 0.9 m/s, a self-selected walking speed, for 30 seconds, repeated four times for each spring stiffness. The results showed that the CMSPC knee can adjust the maximum stance-phase knee flexion from approximately 4.15° to 13.89°, which is roughly the same range observed in non-disabled individuals. Finally, most gait symmetry in temporal variables was significantly improved, with comparable results between the best condition, at a spring stiffness of 12.2 N/mm, and the condition without a spring (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.05). The condition without a spring is represented by hydraulic knees that offer slight stance-phase knee flexion."

Organizational culture shapes behavior, teamwork, leadership, and innovation. Human capital includes technical competence, adaptability, and knowledgesharing. Together, they form the backbone of competitive advantage. This study investigates the impact of organizational culture on human capital in domestic and foreign companies operating in Serbia, i.e., within the same national cultural environment using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network models, the analysis assesses factor significance and ranks their relative importance, thus capturing both linear and nonlinear relationships. The results show that domestic firms prioritize teamwork and technical competence, reflecting more collectivist and “feminine” cultural values, whereas foreign firms emphasize innovation, leadership, and strategic goal balancing, consistent with more individualistic and proactive approaches. The integrated use of regression and AI models provides comprehensive insights into cultural influences on human capital and offers practical implications for management and HR strategies in increasingly globalized and mobile business environments."

The data were collected via an Internet of Things (IoT)-based monitoring system that recorded 13 sensor parameters. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, and K-Means clustering identified three distinct motor states: idle, normal, and overheating. The analysis revealed that Motor 2 frequently entered an overheating state, with current surges above 10 A and temperatures exceeding 90° C, while Motors 1 and 3 remained in stable operating zones. Clustering performance was validated using silhouette analysis, with most samples achieving scores above 0.7. This approach enhances predictive maintenance by enabling automated state identification through low-cost IoT hardware and unsupervised machine learning techniques."

Behaviorally, 5 Hz stimulation significantly enhanced memory accuracy compared to $20 \\mathrm{~Hz}(t=7.141, p=0.019)$. Neural oscillations revealed that while both frequencies increased power in their respective bands, 5 Hz stimulation produced stronger enhancement. Frontal-central $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ power positively correlated with memory performance during 5 Hz stimulation, whereas frontotemporal $\\beta$ power predicted recall under 20 Hz stimulation. These findings demonstrate that 5 Hz parietal rTMS optimizes memory encoding through $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ oscillation enhancement and frontal-parietal network synchronization, while 20 Hz stimulation yields weaker behavioral effects with distinct neural correlates.

This study presents a novel approach using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) as a mathematical framework for decomposing incremental capacity curves and extracting features for state of health estimation. The GMM decomposition transforms complex IC curves into a compact parametric representation, with each Gaussian component characterized by position, width, amplitude, and area parameters. These parameters systematically evolve with battery aging, providing rich information for health assessment. We evaluate three machine learning approaches—Gaussian process regression, random forests, and support vector regression—to establish the relationship between GMM parameters and state of health. Using the Oxford Battery Degradation Dataset, Gaussian process regression achieves the best performance with RMSE of 0.64, followed by random forests (1.40) and support vector regression (1.86). The method demonstrates robust performance across different cells with computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications (~0.03s per curve).

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) employs a holistic framework grounded in the philosophical principles of Yin-Yang theory and the Five Phases (Wu Xing) for constitutional classification and analysis. Western iridology associates the textures and colors of the iris with the body’s physical constitution, innate vulnerabilities, overall health condition, and physiological changes. With the combination of TCM with western iridology, the objective of this study is to provide an accurate and lightweight iris image recognition and detection framework to realize TCM constitution identification. The method combined the image processing technology with the improved YOLOv5 by introducing attention mechanism convolutional block attention module (CBAM). In this study, the data from the public accessible database CASIA-Iris-Thousand was applied to perform the experiments. The optimal performance of the method is as follows: precision is 97.5%, recall is 94.6%, mean average precision is 98.5 %, loss is 0.5 %. It surpasses current state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in iris detection performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves relatively high precision and low loss, demonstrating potential for deployment in real-time iris recognition systems or mobile devices. Additionally, it offers a novel approach and practical solution for TCM constitution differentiation."

High temperature superconductivity is widely used in the field of nuclear fusion and energy storage. Superconducting-battery energy storage system improves the stability of microgrid, especially plays a key role in off-grid islands. Droop control is often used in energy storage converter systems. Aiming at the power coupling and voltage frequency fluctuation of traditional droop control in resistance-inductance lines, an improved droop control strategy is proposed. Firstly, based on the principle of droop control, a general power decoupling droop control formula is proposed. Then, on this basis, the output frequency and voltage amplitude of the droop control are compensated twice to obtain the improved droop control, so as to realize the secondary regulation of voltage and frequency. Finally, based on the Matlab/Simulink platform, a superconducting-electrochemical hybrid energy storage converter model is established. The simulation results show that the improved droop control strategy significantly improves the dynamic response and steady-state performance through power decoupling and secondary compensation to achieve voltage and frequency self-recovery and enhance system adaptability."

    "abstract": "Accurate Travel Time Estimation (TTE) is essential in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as vehicle dispatching, routing, and traffic management. However, existing models often generalize poorly across cities due to diverse urban dynamics. We propose MetaContrast-GNN, a framework that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), contrastive learning, and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for robust cross-city TTE under limited data. Evaluated on taxi datasets from New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., and Ho Chi Minh City, our model outperforms baselines. A GNN trained only on Ho Chi Minh City yields a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 204.27 seconds (around 3.4 minutes) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 209.62 seconds (around 3.5 minutes), while MetaContrast-GNN reduces error to 3.01 and 3.32 minutes, respectively. These results highlight the benefits of meta-learning and contrastive pretraining for scalable, transferable TTE. Though not solving the full vehicle dispatching problem, our method offers a generalizable TTE module to support broader ITS applications."

Although the problem is non-convex, it is reformulated as a convex optimization via tight semi-definite relaxation. A low-complexity zero-forcing interference suppression method is also introduced, alongside a deep learning-based solution for weight optimization. Compared to existing approaches—separate deployment or communication-only radar beam synthesis—the proposed method achieves superior radar performance, with higher beam peaks and better antenna DoF utilization, as validated by simulations."

Ultra-low-frequency oscillations (ULFO) are often introduced by a high proportion of hydropower. To mitigate these issues, a damping control strategy based on coordinated source-grid actions is presented. A frequency response model including hydropower units is first established. The mechanism of ULFO is investigated through damping torque analysis, and the effects of various governor parameters are examined. A comprehensive performance index is defined to evaluate both frequency regulation and oscillation damping. Considering the limited damping capability of hydropower alone, a multi-band additional damping control strategy for the MMC is developed. Through this approach, positive damping is jointly provided by the MMC and hydropower units. Finally, a simulation model is constructed on the CloudPSS platform to validate the effectiveness of the suppression strategy of ULFO. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through comparative case studies, demonstrating improved suppression capacity of both ULFO."

The architecture is based on the frequency domain extraction FFT algorithm, which changes the data input point by point to 16-point by 16-point, and accelerates the FFT calculation speed by 16 times compared with the traditional single-channel FFT. For the situation where the large-point FFT algorithm consumes a lot of storage resources, the SDF-FFT computational structure is adopted to reduce the use of BRAM resources step by step. Compared with Xilinx's FFT IP core, the bandwidth and operation speed of this architecture are increased by 16 times under the same clock frequency, which can be deployed on a single XC7VX690 chip without external storage to meet the requirements of real-time computation for large data, and the correctness of the results is verified by the on-board verification."

To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a diagnostic framework that leverages image fusion and a dual-channel convolutional neural network. First, the MTF-GADF-GASF image conversion method is employed to transform time-series signals into three types of images, which are then encoded into the red, green, and blue (RGB) channels of an image for fusion. Subsequently, one-dimensional signals and two-dimensional images are simultaneously fed into a parallel dual-channel model, where the first channel utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract spatial information, while the second channel employs Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to capture temporal features from vibration signals. Finally, the spatiotemporal features extracted from both channels are fused and trained using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. Experimental results based on public and real-measured datasets indicate that the proposed diagnostic method achieves an average accuracy of 98.75% in fault type diagnosis under various operating conditions. Comparisons with other methods further demonstrate that this approach offers higher accuracy and robustness."

    "abstract": "Leakage currents, resulting from common-mode voltages, represent a serious problem in photovoltaic (PV) inverter systems for personnel, equipment, and compliance with grid codes. The common grounded leg-based inverter topology proved to be a viable solution for addressing the leakage current problem. However, existing topologies suffer from the increased number of switches, a high number of passive components, high voltage stresses, and being diode-based, among other issues. The drawbacks become more apparent in the development of multilevel-based CG inverters. Therefore, this paper proposes a new five-level, F-type-based CG inverter for leakage current-free PV inverters. The proposed topology preserves the continuous PV side current and maximizes power extraction from PV systems. The employment of F-type legs enables multilevel diode-free with reduced voltage stresses compared to NPC and T-NPC inverter legs. Furthermore, a predictive control algorithm is proposed in this paper for controlling both the input and output sides with a single objective function, and eliminating the need for a modulator. Simulation results, enhanced with comparative results, are provided in the paper, which demonstrate the superior merits and performance metrics of the new proposed inverter and control method."

    "abstract": "To simultaneously enhance the environmental and economic benefits of virtual power plant (VPP) scheduling, a multi-objective optimization approach based on carbon flow tracing is proposed. First, a nodal carbon potential calculation model is constructed based on optimal power flow results and carbon flow tracing theory, quantifying the carbon emission intensity of flexible loads. Subsequently, an electricity pricing mechanism based on nodal carbon potential is introduced, establishing a hybrid optimization algorithm through a hierarchical iterative algorithm that achieves closed-loop feedback between electricity price signals and carbon potential distribution. Finally, a case study is simulated, with results demonstrating that the proposed strategy reduces carbon emissions by 17.7% at the same profit level and increases profit by 30.4% under identical carbon emissions, validating its synergistic enhancement effect on grid operation."

    "abstract": "Cancer recurrence prediction is critical for precision medicine and personalized treatment. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in modeling the complex relationships among multi-omics data (mRNA, SNV, miRNA), capturing intersample correlations, and handling data imbalance, thereby constraining predictive performance. To address these issues, we propose a cancer recurrence prediction model MOAM, which incorporates cross-attention fusion and multi-head attention learning. The model integrates prior biological pathway knowledge, utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to capture interomics dependencies, applies a multi-head attention mechanism to extract key features, and performs classification through a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Results from five-fold cross-validation on the BRCA and LIHC datasets demonstrate that MOAM outperforms existing methods in both prediction accuracy and robustness, achieving AUC values of 0.843 and 0.918 and F1-scores of 0.777 and 0.919, respectively, confirming its effectiveness in multi-omics integration and recurrence prediction."

To overcome the influence under uncertain factors in the DMDNNs, adaptive control technology is introduced into the design of controllers. In order to identify unknown parameters for state dependent switching in the DMDNNs within a fixed/predefined settling time, a fixed/predefined time identification method is derived. Under the premise that fixed time synchronization (FTS) is implemented in DMDNNs, adaptive fixed time identifier and controller are redesigned to achieve synchronization and identify unknown parameters in the DMDNNs within a predefined settling time. By the Lyapunov stability method, the corresponding synchronization criteria under FTS and predefined-time synchronization (PTS) are derived. FTS/PTS and identification of parameters under DMDNNs have potential applications in secure communication, pattern recognition, and other fields."

Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof. Validation through simulations and experiments showcases the method's adaptability to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances."

    "abstract": "In secure communications, the focus is on protecting the content of the message. In contrast, low probability of intercept (LPI) communication prioritizes the privacy of the communication process itself. The most restrictive form of LPI communication, where the adversary shuts down the communication as soon as the presence of the transmission is detected, is known as covert communication. To conceal the transmitted signal within solar radiation, we propose using an incoherent Gaussian source modulated with phase-shift keying (PSK). To facilitate detection of the transmitted signal, we propose transmitting a portion of the unmodulated carrier. For establishing the link, we employ a spatial light modulator (SLM)based beam steering approach. To explore these concepts, we have developed a 1.5 km free-space optical link at the University of Arizona campus. Our results demonstrate the record number of covert bits transmitted in the saturation turbulence regime."

    "abstract": "In the field of higher education, students do not become involved in extracurricular activities due to low incentive to submit their achievements in the form of certificates. This is a problem that impacts more than just the students themselves, because in the absence of such elements, academic institutions would have no way to incorporate performance evaluation into their operating strategies, which could also impact the accreditation process. While students tend to procrastinate or skip away with their certificates, gamification can be the answer as the tedious, monotonous documentation procedure can be a participatory activity when game design elements such as badges and leaderboards are integrated into it. This paradigm provides in turn the authentication of the record that accompanies the record of intellectual achievements that are made in a succinct manner, by linking it to the blockchain that provides the immutable and transparent environment for these citations input_documents. Our model combines gamification techniques and blockchain credentialing in a nudging approach for timely submissions without compromising the process integrity that blockchain technology guarantees. The framework presented attempts to use game-based quests rewarding with verification to motivate students and enhance their academic relevancy. We expect this scheme to allow better student participation and overall performance with a more interactive and dependable learning environment."

The measurement results indicate that the combined purity of the tunable OAM multiplexing modes generated by the proposed antenna exceeds 68%. Moreover, the isolation between different OAM modes at the receiving end is close to 15 dB. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that the OAM antenna offers reliable transmission performance for vortex multiplexed beams and supports flexible adjustment of OAM multiplexing orders. This work provides an effective approach to enhance spatial utilization efficiency in overlapped propagation directions, offering new possibilities for high-data-rate wireless communications."

    "abstract": "This article introduces a transmitter (TX) array topology that employs QPSK direct-RF TX units for realizing scalable large-array wireless communication and multifunction systems. By leveraging spatial power combination, the TX units are set to synthesize an extended M-QAM constellation, enabling flexible and high-order modulation. The QPSK modulation, when transmitted in an array, bolsters physical layer security by confining the constellation retrieval to the intended radiation angle, exhibiting high selectivity. Additionally, its low-dynamic-range (DR) waveform supports high-power output and improves the efficiency of power amplifiers (PAs) compared to higher-order constellations, thus significantly enhancing the array’s overall power–performance ratio. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on key performance factors, including location-dependent antenna gain variations, beamforming effectiveness, and phase front flatness. To validate the proposed technique, a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2\\times 4$</tex-math> </inline-formula> array proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation is presented. Measurement results demonstrate robust performance across modulation orders ranging from 16-QAM to 256-QAM, aligning with theoretical predictions. This topology effectively integrates spatial constellation formation with the requirements of large-array systems, offering superior power efficiency. Its scalable building blocks, reconfigurability, and inherent secure communication capabilities make it a strong candidate for next-generation high-data-rate large-array TX systems."

System modeling and parameter optimization of the photonic crystal were conducted using a ray transmission model, theoretically confirming that this structure can efficiently excite TPP mode. Combined with the analysis of the tangential electric field distribution at the resonance wavelength, the formation mechanism of the resonance dip in the transmission spectrum was revealed to originate from the local field enhancement effect of TPP. Further in-depth analysis of the influence of the thickness of each layer on the TPP mode led to the successful fabrication of the designed fiber sensor. Experimental results reveal the excitation of TPP mode in the HF sensor system, which has not been verified by experiments up to now. Compared to traditional HF surface plasmon resonance sensor limitations, which can only detect refractive index (RI) higher than the cladding material, this sensor enables sensitive detection of low RI media. This work not only enriches the experimental research on fiber TPP sensor, but also establishes the theoretical and technical foundation for developing fiber sensors with a wide dynamic range."

By decomposing high-dimensional traffic images into compact patches encoded as quantum Hamiltonians, the proposed design aims to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) tasks such as object detection, vehicle classification, and traffic monitoring in CAVs.The quantum hybrid method serves as a pipeline for extracting selective features that have been optimised using gradient-aware parameter pruning and conditional principal component analysis (PCA). The implementation of this quantum hybrid approach facilitates addressing computational challenges at the edge in embedded vehicular systems, reducing data dimensionality while preserving key discriminative spatial patterns necessary for object detection and traffic monitoring. Although the quantum method currently underperforms in certain clustering and separability metrics, it demonstrates potential as a viable alternative for advanced perception in CAVs.This work lays a foundation for integrating quantum computing into edge-based autonomous vehicle perception, highlighting both opportunities and challenges with near-term quantum hardware."

    "abstract": "Real-time audio streaming transmission and processing play a crucial role in time-sensitive applications such as food delivery services and ride-hailing platforms, where rapid response is essential. However, existing server-based audio streaming architectures struggle to handle the high concurrency of massive mobile devices efficiently. Traditional compression methods like MP3 and AAC offer limited compression ratios, while deep learning-based approaches often fail to meet the real-time transmission demands of edge computing environments. In this paper, we propose a novel edge-to-server audio streaming architecture that leverages Mel filter bank spectral features to achieve ultra-high compression efficiency. Our system integrates audio denoising, Mel feature extraction, and quantization-based compression at the edge, effectively suppressing environmental and device-induced noise while achieving an extreme compression ratio of 0.39% relative to the original uncompressed audio. Compared to conventional methods like MP3, our approach further reduces the file size by 96.1%. The decompressed Mel features remain task-independent, enabling seamless support for various general-purpose audio processing tasks in the server. We evaluate our system across three key audio tasks: speech recognition, speech emotion recognition, and audio classification. Extensive experiments on five different mobile devices demonstrate a 93.10% reduction in transmission latency at 1 Mbps bandwidth compared to 64 kbps MP3 audio, while maintaining task performance within a 5% deviation from state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across six mainstream audio datasets. These results highlight the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of our approach for real-time edge-to-server audio processing."

Accurate monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere requires sensors with enhanced precision. If suspended particles in the airflow can be pre-sorted using microfluidic chips, the performance of most existing microfluidic PM detection systems could be significantly improved. In this study, a T-type optofluidic chip (TOPC) for particle sorting and collection was theoretically designed based on optical principles, and an analytical solution for the particle offset distance within the TOPC was derived. Building upon this, a dimensionless parameter S was introduced by incorporating characteristic parameters of the microfluidic chip to describe particle motion within the TOPC. Particle trajectories under varying conditions were calculated using numerical simulations and compared with theoretical predictions to validate the model. In parallel, an experimental platform was constructed. The results demonstrated that the particle offset errors were <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4.2\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m when compared with the theoretical calculations and numerical simulations, respectively.

    "abstract": "Visual tracking is crucial in nanomanipulation inside scanning electron microscopy (SEM), especially for complex 3D manipulation tasks. However, tracking the micro- and nanoscale objects and manipulators under different rotational angles, especially out-of-plane rotation, remains challenging due to significant changes in their appearance in the image space. In this paper, we propose a template matching-based method for nanoscale tracking, particularly addressing challenges from out-of-plane rotation. By leveraging the image Jacobian matrix, we establish the relationships between image and Cartesian coordinates, enabling dynamic generation of templates for specified rotation angles. Then, a visual tracking pipeline is proposed, consisting of an offline preparation stage and an online tracking stage. Based on the proposed template generation method, the pipeline dynamically generates appropriate templates as rotational angles vary and performs accurate tracking using template matching. Further, the templates can be conveniently generated for specified magnifications using the image Jacobian matrix, enabling adaptation to changes in SEM magnification. Extensive experiments, including tracking under various SEM magnifications, complex trajectories, and different types of end-effectors, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparisons with widely used tracking approaches further highlight its superiority in both tracking accuracy and real-time performance. Finally, the successful deployment of the proposed method in a real nanomanipulation task confirms its practical applicability."

    "abstract": "Rate-distortion curves are a fundamental tool in image compression for evaluating the trade-off between the compressed file size and the resulting image quality. However, these curves can exhibit unexpected irregularities, such as nonmonotonic behavior or “wiggles”, which challenge the conventional rate-distortion theory. In JPEG compression, these irregularities are primarily a consequence of the quantization process and are particularly pronounced in images containing large uniform regions. So, this paper investigates these irregularities firstly for uniform colorless blocks by analyzing the JPEG quantization error, and then for grayscale JPEG compressed images employing a range of objective image quality assessment measures. Our experimental results demonstrate that for such irregular images, selecting a lower quality factor that controls JPEG compression can paradoxically yield better visual quality than a higher quality factor, as the latter can introduce more noticeable blocking artifacts. This finding highlights the critical importance of quality factor selection in JPEG compression for images with uniform areas."

    "abstract": "Conventional Diesel Generators (CDGs) have traditionally been used as the main source of electricity. However, they caused an increase in harmful emissions as well as a decrease in the availability of traditional non-renewable fossil fuels. Hence, the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is an important and effective way to convert the system to a clean and environmentally friendly operation. However, the intermittent nature of these RERs is a challenge to be handled effectively. So, Energy Management System (EMS) is crucial for managing energy supply to the loads from many sources that have different operational natures and characteristics. In this work, two novel optimization algorithms, which are Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) and Political Optimizer (PO), were introduced for achieving an optimal EMS for an MG containing RERs, such as Wind Turbines (WTs), Photovoltaics (PVs), and Combined Heat and Power units (CHP). Also, Energy Storage System (ESS) is included for more system’s reliability through charging while the existence of surplus power and discharge in case of deficit power. The main objective is minimizing total operational cost through optimally dispatching load among different available power sources. The problem objective is achieved while ensuring supply-load balance. The efficacy and effectiveness of proposed POA an PO were proved through obtained numerical results. They were able to reduce the total operational cost by about $25 \\%$ in some cases compared to recently used optimization algorithms."

This study looks into classifying emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based on voice audio data. To increase dataset diversity, we applied several data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting, time-stretching, noise addition, and time-shifting. We used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and wave plots to capture important features. A CNN model was trained on the processed data, showing promising accuracy in telling apart different emotional states. We assess the model’s usefulness with confusion matrices and performance metrics, though we still face challenges in distinguishing between acoustically similar emotions. This paper demonstrates how deep learning techniques can help create emotion-aware systems that enhance human-computer interaction."

In this study, two different auditory ERP paradigms were designed: the semantic paradigm, which focuses on brain activities related to language comprehension, and the non-semantic paradigm, which focuses on non-verbal sound processing. Data from the two paradigms were integrated and analyzed through a joint paradigm analysis approach to more comprehensively assess the level of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness. Based on a review of current theories, such as information theory and brain network theory, we identified three feature dimensions, namely, power spectral density metrics, brain network graph theory metrics, and entropy-like metrics, to explore the feature differences among patients with different levels of consciousness. Entropy class metrics play an important role in distinguishing patients with different levels of consciousness. Through data fusion and feature synergy, the joint paradigm analysis method can more comprehensively assess the level of consciousness of patients with disorders of consciousness than the single paradigm analysis method, providing a more accurate and reliable neurophysiological basis for the diagnosis of disorders of consciousness."

The Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (I-GWO) functions as a metaheuristic algorithm to optimize controller gains, which decreases control errors while improving the system dynamics. The analysis of performance under solar irradiation changes uses MATLAB and Simulink tools to simulate real-world operating scenarios. The optimized controllers receive evaluation against traditional PI controllers through performance metrics that include settling time, overshoot, and the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE). The I-GWO-tuned controllers demonstrate better performance through reduced overshoot, shorter settling time, and enhanced tracking accuracy. The study demonstrates how metaheuristic optimization techniques enhance the performance of smart microgrids through better power distribution and voltage control, stable energy management, and improved dynamic responses."

Results show that as the gap distance decreases, the breakdown transition time shortens from 180.78 μs to 134.54 μs. The initiation time of upward leaders remains relatively stable at approximately 65 μ s, while downward leaders initiate significantly earlier. Leader propagation velocity increases from 10.9 cm/μs in the initial stage to a peak of 67.2 cm/μs prior to breakdown. These findings provide essential data support for the lightning protection design of tower-head structures in high-altitude environments."

Despite the proposal of various high-performance algorithms, their complex models and large computational requirements make it difficult to meet real-time detection and deployment needs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Multi-scale Fusion Lightweight Network (MFLNet). Initially, to minimize parameter quantity and computational expenses while simplifying the feature fusion network, we introduce a Lightweight Cross-Scale Feature Fusion (CSFF) module. Subsequently, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement (MSFE) module to improve the capability of the network to extract features from different receptive fields and enhance the adaptability of the network to variable objects. Experimental results indicate that the mean average precision (mAP) on the public datasets RSOD and DIOR is 93.2% and 69.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the initial model, the number of parameters and calculation amount of MFLNet are reduced by 5% and 7.4% respectively, while simultaneously increasing inference speed by 11%."

However, existing methods primarily designed for generic action classification - often fail to distinguish visually similar actions that differ in intent, and they lack sensitivity to subtle object interactions and motion patterns. To address these limitations, a multi-stream framework is proposed, integrating pose estimation, object interaction modeling, and motion dynamics analysis to enhance anomaly detection in real-world surveillance scenarios. In addition, a temporal smoothing mechanism is introduced to mitigate transient misclassifications and improve temporal consistency. Experimental results on the HAR dataset demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as VideoMAE and MoViNet across all major evaluation metrics, achieving 96.51 % accuracy and 97.3 % F1-Score. These results underscore the framework's effectiveness for accurate and real-time anomaly detection in complex surveillance environments."

    "abstract": "In this article, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for dual active bridge (DAB) converters under triple phase shift (TPS) is proposed. Traditional single-loop control cannot provide a satisfactory dynamic response under TPS in DAB converters. Although MPC offers good dynamic performance, conventional MPC for DAB converters under TPS control suffers from high computational complexity, which limits the achievable switching frequency and degrades the dynamic response. To address these issues, an improved MPC strategy is proposed to achieve a fast dynamic performance for the DAB converter by eliminating the effect of control delay, while also enabling higher switching frequencies. The proposed control method is derived from an expression for the phase shift angle based on the output current, which is analyzed by the modulation strategy under TPS. In addition, a parameter identification method based on a discrete integrator is introduced to ensure parameter accuracy while requiring lower computational complexity than model-based identification methods. The stability of the system is analyzed through small-signal modeling, which demonstrates good frequency response. Finally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method in improving dynamic response."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of 6G, cell-free massive multiple input and multiple output (CF-mMIMO) networks demands scalable, accurate, and privacy-preserving solutions for active user detection (AUD). One of the significant challenge in CF-mMIMO is that it should support a large number of devices over the same time and frequency resources. In CF-mMIMO the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> number of user devices is served through the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i> arbitrarily distributed access points (APs). Each AP is assumed to be equipped with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> antennas. Due to the limited channel coherence interval length, assigning orthogonal pilot sequences to each user device is not feasible. Hence, the users are given unique non orthogonal pilot sequences. Therefore, in the massive random-access scenario, the probability of multiple active devices selecting the same sequence is quite high. Thus, activity detection is a challenging problem in grant-free massive random-access schemes. Traditional centralized approaches are hindered by communication bottlenecks and privacy risks, especially in ultra-dense deployments. This paper presents a federated learning (FL) framework that leverages Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to distribute and preserve privacy in AUD across access points (AP). Each AP acts as an FL client, locally training on synthetic pilot-signal data generated under a Rician fading model with Gaussian noise to emulate realistic SNR conditions. Model updates are aggregated via FedAvg and FedProx, with differential privacy (DP) enforced through adaptive Gaussian noise on gradients. K-Means clustering and Voronoi tessellation are used for dynamic user AP association and interference mitigation. A thorough simulation-based performance analysis is performed to evaluate the CF-mMIMO system using metrics such as detection accuracy, SNR analysis, clustering efficiency, and privacy-accuracy trade-offs. Experimental evaluation through simulations are performed in two configurations (A) 100 users, 300 APs; (B) 100 users, 1000 APs) demonstrates robust detection accuracy (85–88%), stable convergence within 75–100 rounds, and resilience to SNR variations (0–27 dB). The framework maintains high utility under strong privacy guarantees (ϵ = 1.8 –3.2, δ = 1e−5), with only a drop in precision of 1.2 to 2.8%. Advanced AP clustering reduces interference by up to 37%, supporting efficient service in dense and dynamic environments. These results establish the proposed FL-LSTM approach as a scalable, secure, and high-performance solution for AUD in next-generation CF-mMIMO networks, with practical relevance for smart cities, IoT, and privacy-sensitive applications."

    "abstract": "Visual scene understanding involves multiple tasks, including single-object tracking (SOT), multi-object tracking (MOT), video object segmentation (VOS), and its Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) variant, which have traditionally been studied in isolation. Such fragmentation leads to task-specific architectures that must be retrained for each new scenario and rely heavily on annotated data. Thiswork proposes a synergetic model called SSF4VSU that simultaneously addresses SOT,MOT,VOS, and MOTS. SSF4VSU employs a shared backbone with a unified embedding space for different tasks, a Temporal Attention Module (TAM) to align features across frames and resist occlusions, a Temporal Consistency Module (TCM) to enforce smooth identity preservation, and a self-supervised learning (SSL) branch that leverages unlabeled video sequences for improved generalization. Training follows a multi-task curriculum with dynamic loss balancing, demonstrating efficiency and scalability. A comprehensive evaluation across six public benchmarks shows that SSF4VSU surpasses specialised and unified state-of-the-art models. On SOT benchmarks it achieves 74.7% success AUC and 80.4% precision on LaSOT, and 85.8% AUC and 84.3% precision on TrackingNet, matching or exceeding recent specialised trackers. For MOT, it records 82.9% MOTA and 83.3% IDF1 on the MOT17 dataset, while on BDD100K it generalises to driving scenes without task-specific tuning. On VOS benchmarks, SSF4VSU delivers 93.3% <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">J&amp;F</i> on DAVIS-2016 and 89.0% <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">J&amp;F</i> on DAVIS-2017, surpassing strong segmentation methods and unified baselines. In the MOTS setting it achieves 69.0% sMOTSA on MOTS20 and 31.2% mMOTSA on BDD100K MOTS. Ablation studies reveal that TAM is critical for accurate localisation, TCM is indispensable for identity stability, and SSL consistently improves generalization. The results demonstrate that a single unified model can perform diverse tracking and segmentation tasks without sacrificing accuracy or efficiency. By reducing reliance on labelled data, improving temporal reasoning, and ensuring interpretability, SSF4VSU advances the state of visual scene understanding and lays the foundation for general-purpose, multi-task video analysis."

    "abstract": "The digital transformation of educational systems has significantly optimized administrative workflows and enhanced the user experience for educators and learners. However, the accumulation of sensitive personal data on educational websites has made them prime targets for cyber threats. Despite growing awareness of these security challenges, the technical roots of vulnerabilities within such platforms remain insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-EduAttackGraph, a specialized tool designed to assist in vulnerability detection by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Rather than serving as a fully automated monitoring system, LLM-EduAttackGraph operates as a human-in-the-loop assistant, combining expert knowledge with the analytical capabilities of LLMs to help identify potential penetration paths based on network fingerprint information. Using LLM-EduAttackGraph, we have so far identified 961 penetration vulnerabilities across educational websites in mainland China—a number that continues to grow as analysis progresses. These findings demonstrate the tool’s practical value in augmenting cybersecurity research and efforts. Our in-depth analysis of the discovered vulnerabilities reveals that limited developer experience and a heavy dependence on outsourced website development are key contributing factors. By shedding light on these root causes, our research offers actionable strategies and insights aimed at improving the cybersecurity posture of educational platforms and ensuring the sustainable development of online education. Furthermore, we have compared LLM-EduAttackGraph with several existing large model penetration tools to demonstrate the performance of LLM-EduAttackGraph. Such strengths include its low demand for hardware resources and having undergone empirical verification."

    "abstract": "Empowered by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies, 6G Perceptive Mobile Network (PMN) is expected to offer ubiquitous sensing capability, leveraging the communications infrastructure. Bistatic sensing can bypass the stringent full-duplex requirement in mono-static sensing and is more practical for (nearterm) implementation. Clock asynchronism, which naturally exists between spatially separated communication nodes, is a central and challenging problem in bi-static sensing. It can cause ranging ambiguity and prevent coherent processing of (discontinuous) measurements (e.g., for Doppler frequency estimation). Should it be resolved, sensing can be efficiently realised in communication networks, requiring little network infrastructure and hardware changes. This talk delves into advanced techniques for addressing the clock asynchronism challenge in the integration, with a particular focus on efficient solutions requiring only a single receiver. First, this issue will be introduced in the context of 6G perceptive mobile networks. Following this, a comprehensive review will be provided for the latest singlereceiver-based solutions, applicable to both multi-antenna and single-antenna configurations. Additionally, I will showcase our cutting-edge sensing applications developed using these techniques, including moving object tracking, localization, and environmental sensing including rainfall and water level detection. The talk concludes by highlighting unresolved challenges and exploring future research directions in this evolving field"

    "abstract": "Adverse weather conditions, low-light environments, and bumpy road surfaces pose significant challenges to SLAM in robotic navigation and autonomous driving. Existing datasets in this field predominantly rely on single sensors or combinations of LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs. However, 4D millimeter-wave radar demonstrates robustness in adverse weather, infrared cameras excel in capturing details under low-light conditions, and depth images provide richer spatial information. Multi-sensor fusion methods also show potential for better adaptation to bumpy roads. Despite some SLAM studies incorporating these sensors and conditions, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets addressing low-light environments and bumpy road conditions, or featuring a sufficiently diverse range of sensor data. In this study, we introduce a multi-sensor dataset covering challenging scenarios such as snowy weather, rainy weather, nighttime conditions, speed bumps, and rough terrains. The dataset includes rarely utilized sensors for extreme conditions, such as 4D millimeter-wave radar, infrared cameras, and depth cameras, alongside 3D LiDAR, RGB cameras, GPS, and IMU. It supports both autonomous driving and ground robot applications and provides reliable GPS/INS ground truth data, covering structured and semi-structured terrains. We evaluated various SLAM algorithms using this dataset, including RGB images, infrared images, depth images, LiDAR, and 4D millimeter-wave radar. The dataset spans a total of 18.5 km, 69 minutes, and approximately 660 GB, offering a valuable resource for advancing SLAM research under complex and extreme conditions.

    "abstract": "Compute-Forward Multiple Access (CFMA) is a multiple access transmission scheme based on Compute-and-Forward (CF), which allows the receiver to first decode linear combinations of the transmitted signals and then solve for individual messages. This paper extends the CFMA scheme to a two-user Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC). We propose the CFMA Serial Coding Scheme (SCS) and the CFMA Parallel Coding Scheme (PCS) with nested lattice codes. We first derive the expression of the achievable rate pair for MIMO MAC with CFMA-SCS. We prove a general condition under which CFMA-SCS can achieve the sum capacity of the channel. Furthermore, this result is specialized to single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and 2-by-2 diagonal MIMO multiple access channels, for which more explicit sum capacity-achieving conditions on power and channel matrices are derived. We then study the achievable rate of CFMA-PCS by using an equivalent SIMO model, and analyze its sum capacity-achieving conditions. Numerical results are provided for the performance of CFMA-SCS and CFMA-PCS in different channel conditions. In general, CFMA-PCS has better sum capacity achievability, although with a higher computational complexity for encoding and decoding."

    "abstract": "Partial Volume Effects (PVEs) cause blurring and inaccuracies in activity measurements in SPECT imaging. They are a major challenge, especially for SPECT-based dosimetry in radionuclide therapies using 177 Lu. This study aims to develop and evaluate new deep learning methods to correct PVEs. The proposed methods aim to enhance the accuracy of SPECT quantification by applying deep learning techniques trained on synthetic data. We developed three distinct deep learning approaches to correct PVEs: PVCNet-sino which operates in the projection domain, PVCNet-img that works in the image domain and PVCNet-hybrid that combines information from both domains. The training data included a variety of organ shapes, lesions, and activity distributions. The performance of these networks was compared to Resolution Modeling (RM) and the iterative-Yang (iY) methods, using a large synthetic test dataset, real phantom measurements, Monte Carlo simulations, and patient data. We showed that all of the proposed deep learning methods allowed to reduce PVEs compared to RM. Under some conditions on the inputs and training framework, PVCNet-sino was the most capable of quantifying the activity in the 22/28/37 mm spheres on real NEMA IEC phantom measurements (with Recovery coefficients of 0.97/0.99/1.08) close to or better than iY (1.02/1.02/1.09) and better than PVCNet-img (0.78/0.86/1.07) and RM (0.53/0.65/0.76). But this method leads to noisy images and reconstruction artifacts, mitigated by the PVCNet-hybrid framework, also leading to improved RCs (0.78/0.86/1.07). The better noise/resolution trade-off obtained by the PVCNet-hybrid approach was confirmed on the patient MC simulation, where normalized root mean squared error was reduced by 33% and background noise by 80%. We demonstrate that deep-learning based PVC trained on synthetic data can reduce PVE in SPECT images without any segmentation requirement. This work also shows that using both the sinogram and the image domain is a suitable alternative to post-reconstruction PVC. While applied to 177 Lu, the method is generic and can be used with other radionuclides."

    "abstract": "Serverless computing has been widely adopted in large-scale data analytics. However, a critical challenge in data analytics is the substantial variability in the volume of data assigned to individual function invocations across executions. This high degree of inter-invocation variability introduces performance unpredictability and complicates efficient resource utilization. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue through vertical scaling, but their effectiveness is inherently limited, as function performance quickly saturates with increased resource allocation. To address these limitations, we propose Chrono, an adaptive serverless analytics framework designed to reduce latency and mitigate cold start overhead under high concurrency. Chrono incorporates three key components: (1) continuous monitoring of function execution to proactively detect risks of SLO violations; (2) dynamic partitioning of unprocessed data among parallel execution instances, aiming to reduce the end-to-end latency; and (3) the integration of lightweight shadow functions running in shared environments, effectively reducing cold start latency. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets indicate that Chrono outperforms existing methods by reducing average latency by up to 43.16% and 45.42% in 99th percentile latency. Regarding resource utilization, Chrono improves multi-core CPU utilization by 60.6%, and decreases maximum memory usage by 27.2%."

By precisely simulating patients and medical processes, CCDT establish a link to the virtual healthcare environment, supporting improved diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and predictive analytics. Blockchain technology is critical in connecting the physical and virtual health care worlds, providing secure storage, efficient communication, reduced computational costs, and reliable hosting services. However, the security of patient data and its digital twin counterpart stored on the blockchain remains a potential vulnerability, as any alteration or unauthorized access to this information could pose significant risks. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-enabled quantum encryption protocol for CCDT healthcare networks to ensure secure communication. The proposed protocol leverages blockchain to authenticate patients without relying on third-party entities. At the same time, a secure quantum encryption mechanism ensures that CCDT do not need to authenticate repeatedly when interacting with multiple healthcare providers. A performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to existing encryption methods. The results indicate that the suggested protocol is resilient against various security threats, showcasing its significant potential for enhancing communication security within CCDT healthcare networks."

    "abstract": "The major challenge in evolutionary many-task optimization (EMaTO) is to transfer knowledge among the tasks effectively. Moving on existing EMaTO algorithms, which mainly focus on what kind of knowledge to select and how to transfer the selected knowledge, this article focuses on a novel perspective to tackle the issue of when to transfer knowledge. This gives rise to a requirement-driven adaptive differential evolution (RADE) algorithm. Specifically, the RADE introduces a dual-scale evolutionary state estimator (ESE) to evaluate the state of evolution from both temporal and spatial scales, obtaining the real optimization requirement of the population and thus adaptively controlling the timing of knowledge transfer. This way, RADE not only leads to efficiently dealing with the when issue, but also drives two adaptive strategies for knowledge selection and knowledge transfer, leading to more efficient dealing with the what and the how issues, respectively. In particular, a requirement-driven adaptive knowledge selection strategy merges the evolutionary state similarity and the population distribution similarity for enhancing the selection of relevant source knowledge. Then, a requirement-driven adaptive knowledge transfer strategy is executed based on adaptive parameters and operators, thus significantly improving the efficiency of knowledge transfer. Experimental results on the CEC19 and WCCI22 benchmarks show that RADE outperforms the compared state-of-the-art EMaTO algorithms in both effectiveness and efficiency."

A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 50 second-year medical students from a private university in Arequipa, randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. The experimental group participated in three 90-minute sessions over two weeks, using Hi5 Noitom 2.0 gloves and VR platforms (Hand Physics Lab and VR Surgery Simulator) to perform tasks such as suturing, forceps manipulation, and anatomical palpation. Three validated instruments were employed, a psychomotor rubric, a self-assessment questionnaire, and an observation checklist, all demonstrating strong reliability (α = 0.83–0.88). Statistical analyses (independent samples t-tests, ANCOVA, and repeated-measures ANOVA) revealed significant improvements (p < 0.001) in movement precision, visuomotor coordination, technical sequencing, execution time, safety, and feedback in the experimental group, supported by large effect sizes (η² up to 0.86). Students also reported higher confidence and motivation, reflecting both objective and perceived benefits. Under controlled exploratory conditions, these findings suggest that haptic-feedback VR environments can foster realistic, safe, and engaging learning experiences that support the development of psychomotor competencies. The study highlights the pedagogical promise of immersive simulation as a complementary tool to traditional instruction and recommends future longitudinal and multi-site research to validate and generalize the results."

    "abstract": "Assigning tasks to developers and scheduling them under constraints is a core challenge in the Software Project Scheduling Problem (SPSP) research. Although modular architectures reduce team dependencies, task interdependencies persist, creating coordination needs that emerge after task assignment and scheduling. These coordination needs introduce a risk of breakdowns, which can lead to delays, rework, and productivity loss. While sequential task scheduling could help mitigate these risks by reducing coordination needs, it is often impractical in real projects where tight deadlines or parallel task execution are required. Existing SPSP approaches often overlook coordination risks, focusing instead on optimizing cost, makespan, or skill-task fit. We address this gap by modeling task assignment and scheduling in modular projects as a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize coordination breakdown risks, project makespan, and workload imbalance. To solve this problem, we apply NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and SMS-EMOA, and compare their performance across loosely and tightly coupled task scenarios. Our results revealed that NSGA-III provides balanced performance across objectives, SMS-EMOA suits tightly coupled scenarios where solution diversity matters, and NSGA-II works best for loosely coupled scenarios despite its inconsistency, making the choice of the algorithm to use context-specific."

RADFETs with different gate oxide thicknesses, including dual-gate high-k dielectric structures, were tested by monitoring threshold voltage shifts in response to accumulated radiation dose. The results indicate that devices with thicker oxide layers demonstrate greater sensitivity due to enhanced charge trapping. Moreover, lower dose rates were found to increase sensor sensitivity, particularly in devices with thinner oxides. These findings contribute to the optimization of RADFET design for reliable and accurate total ionizing dose measurements in space environments."

The central composite design method was used to design the test points, and a response surface surrogate model was established to further optimize the design parameters. The optimized design results were verified using the Monte Carlo random sampling method, revealing that the optimized parameter combinations significantly reduced the maximum stress value of the structure and improved the reliability of the connection structure.

The faulty state is further subdivided into minor, emergency, and serious faults. Subsequently, the paper elaborates on the essential elements involved in constructing the health evaluation index system, which encompasses diverse information such as telemetry data. A hierarchical architecture is meticulously designed, consisting of a target layer, an element layer, and an index layer. And then, multiple evaluation indicators are proposed. Based on these designs, an evaluation system is put forward, constructed from two aspects: expert-knowledge-based subsystem assessment and intelligent analysis. Moreover, calculation methods for health scores at all levels are provided. Experimental evaluations of the health status of multiple spacecrafts are conducted. The results demonstrate that this method can effectively establish a health status evaluation system for spacecrafts, thereby assisting operators in accurately determining the health status of spacecrafts."

This paper presents an unsupervised method using convolutional autoencoders to identify surface anomalies in woven fabrics. The model is trained purely on normal fabric samples and learns to reconstruct typical textures. Any significant reconstruction error indicates the possible presence of a defect. Three common defect types; holes, spots, and bars are used to evaluate the model's efficiency. The images were converted to grayscale to simplify processing and accelerate training. Experimental tests show that the model achieves high detection accuracy, especially for structurally pronounced defects such as holes. While the results are promising, some limitations remain, particularly for the detection of low-contrast or subtle defects such as spots. The proposed system can be useful in industrial inspection settings where annotated data is scarce. In future work, we plan to investigate more advanced structures and evaluate the impact of using color channels. The goal is to develop a lightweight and flexible solution for real-time deployment in small and medium-sized manufacturing environments."

    "abstract": "As a quantitative cartographic satellite, the LT-1 satellite system proposes high-precision measurement requirements for SAR antenna pointing, SAR antenna radiation surface geometric center position, GNSS antenna phase center position, etc. to meet the needs of high-precision deformation and elevation measurement. It is necessary to accurately obtain the absolute positions of SAR and GNSS antenna pointing, geometric center or phase center in the satellite body layout coordinate system. To this end, a method was proposed to design satellite reference blocks and reference prisms, set up the prism of the object being measured, and then determine its orientation and positional accuracy by measuring the relative position and angle relationship between the prism of the object being measured and the reference block and reference prism. This solved the problem that the origin of the reference coordinate system and the measured target point cannot be directly measured."

    "abstract": "Emerging finite control set (FCS) model predictive control (MPC) methods for multiphase, especially five-phase, drive systems are recommended and increased to improve the controllability and the general performance. However, due to the complexity of these methods, the conventional selection criteria for the standard FCS-MPC require extensive and complex arithmetic processes to select the optimal control action, increasing the controller hardware requirements. Hence, this paper presents a simplified new criterion to select the optimal control action for FCS-MPC of five-phase PMSM drives. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed selection method is based on the location of the reference voltage vector components in the two orthogonal control subspaces, namely $\\alpha-\\beta$ and $x-y$ subspaces. Ten candidates are selected as the best vectors for achieving the control objective. Furthermore, two linear systems of five equations are constructed and solved to solve the control objectives without the enumeration process. The best voltage vector can be selected and applied in the next control interval from the obtained solution. The proposed selection strategy exhibits a compromise between complexity and performance compared to the existing schemes, as given by MATLAB simulation results."

In this paper, we review a deepfake detection approach based on complementary characteristics of convolutions and transformers. In particular, we employ ResNet50, a convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts rich spatial features and local textures from images, and the Vision Transformer (ViT) which learns long-range dependencies and global context by treating images as sequences of patches. Concatenated representations derived from the two models are fed into classification algorithms. In this work, we experiment with the OpenForensics dataset which contains both real and fake images. The results show that features from both ResNet50 and ViT provide significantly improved classification performance when the features are combined together to form a new feature vector; than when either model is used alone. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of these features using a Random Forest classifier and dense layers, and show that the feature representations on their own extracted from both of the models can generalize and perform well using both classification methods."

Existing tools for assessment often rely on static data, which cannot capture the dynamic physiological changes that are critical for timely risk stratification. To overcome this limitation, we extracted relevant patient data from the MIMIC-IV database and proposed a novel machine learning model to predict the $\\mathbf{3 0}$-day mortality risk of patients. We constructed an end-to-end fusion model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to process timeseries clinical data while using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to process static baseline features. The model’s performance was primarily evaluated using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AU-PRC) and compared with traditional clinical scoring systems (SOFA, SAPS II, LODS, OASIS) and conventional machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, LightGBM and XGBoost). The proposed fusion model achieved an AU-PRC of 0.5816 on the test set, significantly outperforming established clinical scoring systems such as SAPS II (AU-PRC = 0.3127) and the strongest traditional machine learning model, LightGBM (AU-PRC $\\boldsymbol{=} \\mathbf{0. 5 6 1 4}$). Our findings suggest that by integrating patients’ dynamic data, this fusion model provides a more powerful tool for predicting mortality risk in critically ill patients with CAD, potentially improving clinical decision-making quality by identifying high-risk individuals earlier."

To solve above problem, this paper proposed optimal beam scanning strategy based on mechanic-electronic joint for spaceborne radar. Firstly, this paper describes and illustrates the satellite attitude and antenna pointing of spaceborne radar, and then the superiority of the Mechanic-Electronic Joint Scanning method is theoretically analysed, finally a real-time optimization model for beam angle control based on Mechanic- Electronic Joint Scanning is proposed. In the model, the K-means clustering algorithm is used in the model to calculate the mechanical scanning preset points and the beam control angle is calculated. According to the real scene simulation, the results show that the proposed method effectively improves the detection capability of the spaceborne radar."

We constructed a balanced dataset from Skin 90 and DermNet sources through re-annotation, mild augmentation, and combined over-undersampling. Experiments were conducted under identical conditions, and model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5, and training time. Results showed that NAdam achieved the highest precision (0.823) and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{mAP} {@} 0.5(0.735)$</tex>, while SGD produced the highest recall (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 6 7 6}$</tex>).

By taking charge of both repetitive and cognitively demanding tasks, AI is contributing to a reconfiguration of work structures and a redefinition of roles within organizations. These technological developments do not merely affect productivity; they also reshape the culture of work by influencing skills requirements, modes of collaboration, and the relationship between humans and digital systems.AI is increasingly integrated into business operations through intelligent tools designed to streamline processes, optimize resource use, and support strategic decision-making. While these innovations often lead to gains in efficiency and cost reduction, they also entail a gradual shift in the nature of work. In several sectors—such as data processing, forecasting, and industrial automation—human tasks are being reduced or radically altered, raising essential questions about the future of employment, the emergence of new professions, and the need for large-scale reskilling.At the same time, AI plays a central role in shaping the digital culture of organizations. It enables new forms of communication and coordination through smart platforms, facilitates real-time decision-making, and encourages more agile, data-informed approaches to project management. In this context, digital culture becomes increasingly marked by adaptability, continuous learning, and an openness to innovation.However, this integration is not without ethical and social implications. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and the risks of job displacement call for critical reflection. The evolution of work in the age of AI requires hybrid competencies—combining technical know-how and digital literacy with human qualities such as creativity, emotional intelligence, and ethical judgment."

After choosing the suitable stator and rotor poles combination with suitable pole arc of each part, a comparison is provided between the performance of the proposed designs of AFSG with rotor pole shoe and without it. The comparison is concerned with different variables such as output voltage waveforms, total harmonic distortion (THD), no-load and load characteristics. The theoretical results were carried out using finite element analysis software (ANSYS Maxwell software). The prototype for the new AFSG design has been built in a collaboration with the Arab Organization of Industrialization. The results were examined experimentally where a good agreement between the theoretical and measured performance has been obtained."

This article studies the imaging performance of a cooled CCD camera in dark fields using an automatic exposure algorithm. Compared with traditional imaging algorithms, it achieves higher precision exposure duration control.

This study proposes the Single Center Imputation from Multiple Chained Equations (SICE) as an alternative approach for imputing missing values in nominal datasets. Experiments on the Adult Income and Hypothyroid datasets involved preprocessing, one-hot encoding, and imputations using KNN, MICE, and SICE. Results were evaluated using Logistic Regression and Random Forest based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, supported by paired t-tests. SICE consistently outperformed other methods-on the Hypothyroid dataset, F1-score improved from 0.53 (MICE) to 0.74 (SICE). The findings demonstrate that SICE is a robust method for nominal data imputation."

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on centralized data collection are no longer suited for these distributed and heterogeneous environments. They pose significant privacy issues, latency concerns, and network overhead. In this context, I propose an innovative intrusion detection approach and new way based on Federated Learning (FL) integrated into a hybrid Edge-Cloud architecture. The goal is to design a privacy-preserving, distributed, and intelligent IDS that learns from local data on Edge nodes without ever transferring the data to a central server. Only model weights are aggregated at the Cloud level, thus reducing data leakage risks while conserving network resources. Our methodology involves deploying Deep Learning models (such as CNN or LSTM) trained locally on IoT data subsets, then federated via techniques like FedAvg. The system’s performance will be evaluated using standard metrics (accuracy, recall, F1-score), as well as latency, energy consumption, and bandwidth. Expected results aim to demonstrate that integrating Federated Learning into an Edge-Cloud infrastructure not only strengthens IoT network security but also ensures efficient, distributed, and privacy-compliant processing."

Specifically, CF-HPNet learns compact channel representations from received pilot signals and quantizes them into low-dimensional feedback bits, which are directly mapped to an interference-aware hybrid precoder via a graph convolutional network (GCN)-enhanced decoder, bypassing explicit channel estimation and reconstruction. Simulation results substantiate that the proposed CF-HPNet delivers marked gains in achievable sum rate over conventional schemes, especially when pilot and feedback resources are severely limited."

We borrow a deconstruction approach from literary critique to explore the instability of meaning in language and reveal implicit beliefs in words and ideas. Through our analysis we surface two sets of opposing implicit beliefs in visual data journalism: objectivity/subjectivity and humanism/mechanism. We contextualize these beliefs through a genealogical analysis, which brings deconstruction theory into practice by providing a historic backdrop for these opposing perspectives. Our analysis shows that these beliefs held within visual data journalism are not self-enclosed but rather a product of external societal forces and paradigm shifts over time. Through this work, we demonstrate how thinking with critical theories such as deconstruction and genealogy can reframe “success” in visual data storytelling and diversify visualization research outcomes. These efforts push the ways in which we as researchers produce domain knowledge to examine the sociotechnical issues of today's values towards datafication and data visualization.

Specifically, we focus on the multi-task MAPD where each task consists of multiple targets, and robots are assigned multiple tasks within a budget to deliver in one trip. This problem is challenging because it involves considering an optimal visitation sequence of targets during task assignment. Additionally, managing tasks that are continuously released online demands an efficient algorithm. Therefore, we propose a new task allocation method that iteratively identifies tasks with the shortest detour paths using the TSP algorithm. This method consistently ensures that task groups have the most efficient travel routes for tasks released online. Additionally, we boost computational efficiency by addressing an online TSP, speeding up the computation by focusing on the visitation sequence of only new targets instead of all targets. Extensive experiments on benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving over a 45% reduction in service time."

    "abstract": "In-hand manipulation has become increasingly popular in recent robotics research, probably due to the growing trend towards humanoids and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Although existing works show promising results, they typically require expensive dexterous hands, depth cameras and tactile sensors which are challenging for algorithm reproduction and large-scale applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a practical and low-cost solution to the classic in-hand cube reorientation task. The proposed method is characterized by a hierarchical structure. Specifically, several in-hand motion primitives, such as object rotation and flipping, are trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL). A high-level decision module switches between these motion primitives, adapting to specific task requirements without the need for retraining. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves continuous reorientation of the cube for nearly twenty minutes using only a low-cost LEAP Hand and a single RGB camera. The proposed method was the winning solution for in-hand manipulation at the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) during ICRA 2024. Implementation details and evaluation results are discussed in this paper. We also open-source hardware designs, code, and videos on <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://rgmc-xl-team.github.io/inhand_reorientation/</uri> to encourage re-implementation and further development."

    "abstract": "A GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is reported on a diamond substrate using an ultra-thin 4H-SiC stress buffer layer (~784 nm), which was heterogeneously integrated via a novel secondary transfer technique combined with surface activated bonding. The bonding rate reached as high as of 98% and a record thermal boundary resistance of 13.6 m²·K/GW was achieved at 4H-SiC/diamond interface. The improved thermal performance is attributed to amorphous interlayer disappearance and partial recrystallization during annealing. The junction temperature was evaluated at the highest power dissipation condition of 32.5 W/mm on the SiC/diamond substrate among the reported studies. At 23.4 W/mm, the junction temperature was 40.5 °C lower than that on the SiC substrate. These results indicate that 4H-SiC/diamond engineered substrate features a highly promising potential for the high power and radio-frequency device applications."

    "abstract": "Language-guided localization within 3D environments continues to pose a significant challenge for autonomous systems, primarily due to the need for precise alignment between sparse point cloud data and inherently ambiguous natural language descriptions. To address this, we present a novel vision-language localization framework, namely FourierPlace, that leverages frequency-domain representations to enhance the alignment of complex geometric features with imprecise linguistic cues. At the core of our approach is the Frequency Fusion Enhancement (FFE) module, which converts raw point cloud data into frequency-domain signals. Complementing this, the Fourier Gate Attention (FGA) mechanism operates on these frequency-domain features to strengthen cross-modal correspondence. Furthermore, we introduce the Hierarchical Language Understanding Network (HiLUNet), which progressively refines linguistic features through a multi-stage architecture. Additionally, the Multiscale Cascade Cross-Attention (MCCA) module incorporates geometric information at multiple scales in the fine stage. Experiments conducted on the KITTI360Pose benchmark demonstrate that FourierPlace achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods with 3.7% improvement in Top-1 coarse retrieval accuracy and 4.0% increase in Top-1 localization accuracy within a 15-meter threshold on the test set. Our proposed framework presents a robust and scalable solution for language-guided localization in large-scale autonomous applications, including delivery robotics and augmented reality (AR) navigation systems.

This paper presents IRIS (Iterative Refinement for Instruction-guided Segmentation), a closed-loop framework that employs dynamic propose-segment-evaluate-optimize cycles to progressively refine spatial predictions. IRIS integrates a multimodal large language model with a pretrained segmentation model, utilizing intermediate segmentation outputs as visual feedback signals for iterative spatial prompt refinement. The framework incorporates task-specific reward functions optimized through Grouped Relative Policy Optimization, enabling systematic self-correction and mitigation of error propagation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements, with IRIS in mean Intersection over Union compared to state-of-the-art baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

    "abstract": "In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) often degrades significantly due to multipath effects. However, these multipath signals also carry information about the geometric characteristics of surrounding reflectors. This study reports, for the first time, the detection of systematic interference patterns in GNSS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data caused by reflections from building vertical facades. Analysis suggests that these patterns originate from coherent interference effects from single-bounce reflections. We verified this phenomenon and accurately extracted its spectral features using GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR). In developing the interference model, this research breaks through the limitations of conventional ground-reflection models by proposing a generalized three-dimensional phase difference model suitable for arbitrary reflecting surfaces. By integrating the satellite line-of-sight vector and the wall normal vector, the model achieves precise geometric characterization of the incidence angle and reflection path. Comparative experiments using high-precision laser rangefinders demonstrate strong agreement between the inverted reflector distances and ground truth, achieving centimeter-level accuracy (RMSE: 0.03–0.05 m) under smooth facade conditions. This study not only confirms the existence and detectability of single-bounce multipath signals in urban canyons but also provides a physical model and interpretation, opening new avenues for urban environment sensing using GNSS multipath signals."

The system utilizes a multidimensional swarm flight strategy, employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adapt the tracking unit’s movements based on the received signal strength indicators emitted by unauthorized UAVs. Asynchronous learning techniques involving multiple agents are implemented to expedite the system’s learning process. A key feature of our approach is the coordinated use of a swarm of UAVs, which circumvents the considerable size burden associated with mounting multiple antennas on a single UAV. We further refine the asynchronous DRL framework by integrating advanced channel modeling techniques, such as spatial correlation and Doppler shift, to augment the robustness and adaptability of the system. Performance evaluations confirm the system’s efficacy under varying channel conditions and operational scenarios. Key contributions include the integration of tracking and chasing functionalities into a unified system, the employment of realistic channel models to enhance system adaptability, and a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between channel sampling frequency and chasing performance. This research advances the field of UAV regulation and control, offering an effective solution to the escalating security challenges posed by unauthorized UAVs."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive reliability analysis of a wind turbine system based on three critical components, the shaft, gearbox and generator. The primary objective is to evaluate the Time Between Failures for each component and to identify the statistical models that most accurately represent their failure behaviours. Four widely recognized statistical distributions (3-parameter Weibull, 2-parameter exponential, normal and 3-parameter lognormal) are assessed. Model selection is based on goodness of fit measures using the Anderson Darling coefficient, with parameters estimated through both Maximum Likelihood and Least Squares Estimations. A notable similarity between the best fit distributions for the shaft prompted the employment of Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterions to resolve this inconsistency and ensure optimal model selection. The analysis reveals significant variability in component reliability. The gearbox, characterized by early life failures and highest failure rates, emerges as the most critical component impacting the wind turbine's overall reliability. This is especially important given the turbine's series configuration, where the failure of any single component results in total system failure. However, the shaft exhibits a wear out failure pattern, with reliability decreasing steadily over time, while the generator demonstrates the highest and most stable reliability, associated with random failure behaviour. The results highlight the importance of component specific reliability assessment and statistical modelling in optimizing wind turbine performance. By integrating probability density, survival and hazard analyses with robust statistical fitting, it offers valuable insights into individual component behaviour and system level reliability, thereby supporting the development of targeted maintenance strategies and improved operational planning."

In practical spectral analysis, signals are typically discrete and finite, making the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) the digital counterpart of the continuous FT. Among the two main forms of the DFT, the ordinary DFT (ODFT) and the symmetric DFT (SDFT), recent studies have shown that the SDFT is more suitable as the discrete counterpart of the FT. However, like ODFT, SDFT suffers from high computational complexity and significant memory usage. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fast algorithm for SDFT. The fundamental principle involves utilizing the FFT to efficiently compute the SDFT by exploiting its theoretical connection to the ODFT. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces both computation time and memory consumption, offering an efficient solution for practical applications."

While existing literature has largely focused on proposing new MPC topologies and validating their operation under diverse power flow scenarios, comparatively less attention has been paid to enhancing their efficiency and power density through modulation and design optimization. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies applied to the multiport Y-converter (Y-MPC). Specifically, sinusoidal PWM, symmetric PWM, and discontinuous PWM are considered. The analysis targets residential-scale applications, where a 10 kW Y-MPC interfaces the LV ac grid with two 400 V dc ports. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) procedure is employed to systematically explore the design trade-offs and identify Paretooptimal solutions across a broad design space for the various PWM techniques. The results offer new insights into the impact of PWM strategies on MPC performance, establishing benchmark figures of merit for practical designs. Among the examined techniques, discontinuous PWM is shown to achieve superior efficiency and compactness, thereby redefining performance boundaries for MPC topologies."

Traditional control methods often rely on gain tuning through extensive Bode plot analysis or trial-and-error hardware testing, lacking a systematic methodology for gain selection across varying operating points.This paper introduces an analytical, impedance-based modeling approach to predict and ensure system stability in SPMSM drives. Utilizing Middlebrook’s Stability Criterion, the interaction between source and load impedance is analyzed in the frequency domain to derive a model-driven method for calculating the necessary active damping gain. This eliminates the need for empirical tuning or hardware validation across different conditions.The proposed method is validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, demonstrating that the analytically determined gain effectively suppresses voltage oscillations and enhances system robustness at different operating points. This work establishes a comprehensive framework for impedance-based stability analysis and gain selection, with significant implications for the design of reliable motor drives and electric propulsion systems."

    "abstract": "The traditional wavelet transform relies on a predefined wavelet kernel function, which is difficult to adapt to various signal types. The neural network can adaptively extract embedded features of signals, but the black-box nature limits its application in industry. This paper proposed an interpretable adaptive feature extraction distillation network (AFEDN) that integrates adaptive feature extraction with knowledge distillation. During the AFEDN training process, a teacher network integrated with the adaptive signal feature extraction layer is first trained to obtain complex interpretable time-frequency domain feature representations. The original vibration signal can be adaptively decomposed into different sub-bands, and each sub-band is weighted and fused to enhance the discrimination of significant features and the anti-noise performance. Subsequently, we apply a knowledge distillation strategy combining soft and hard targets to efficiently convert the feature representation of the complex network to a lightweight network. The effectiveness of the AFEDN is validated in compound fault diagnosis tasks of the planetary gearbox dataset, and the diagnostic accuracy is 99.92%. Additionally, the Fourier spectra analysis demonstrates that the proposed AFEDN can accurately capture the fault characteristic frequency, which provides an intuitive physical explanation for the network’s decision-making."

Due to factors such as load and clearance, the actual meshing line frequently deviates from the theoretical mesh line, resulting in corner contact during the meshing process and leading to meshing impacts. Existing vibration signal models fail to accurately characterize the impact phenomenon. To this end, the corner contact impacts under healthy and fault state were analyzed, and then an improved vibration signal modeling was proposed. Comparative analysis of vibration characteristics considering and ignoring corner contact impact considerations under healthy and faulty conditions was conducted based on the proposed model. In addition, the vibration characteristics of planetary gear train under different loads were explored. The simulation studies reveal distinct sideband distribution patterns around meshing frequencies under varying loads. Results demonstrate significant amplitude growth in meshing frequency with increasing loads. Finally, an experimental analysis was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "Whole engine balancing can improve balancing efficiency, but the measuring points are located on the surface of the casing. The transmission path from the vibration source to the measuring points is complex, which makes the vibration signal vulnerable to the interference of multi-source noise, and reduces the accuracy of the inversion. Therefore, based on the statistical distribution law of the vibration response, random numbers are used to simulate the noise interference in the vibration response. By conducting harmonic response analysis on the model, the influence coefficient considering the complex transmission path is obtained. This coefficient is used to infer the unbalanced response considering noise interference. Statistical analysis is conducted on the original response containing noise interference and the inverse response results obtained by optimization methods. Normal distribution is used to approximate the original response and inverse response. The difference rate between the mean and standard deviation of them is calculated, as well as the probability of the normal distribution of the original response in the 2σ and 3σ intervals of the normal distribution of the inverse response. Compared with the results of the single group response inverse method, it shows that the statistical analysis can overcome the contingency of the single group results in the dynamic balance of the whole engine. The results show that the influence of the uncertainty of noise interference is considered in the dynamic balance of the whole engine by using the statistical analysis. The inverse result is reasonable and accurate. This method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the dynamic balance of the whole engine, and provides theoretical support and method reference for the engineering application of the dynamic balance of the whole engine."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of insufficient real-time monitoring of the dynamic characteristics of rotating machinery under multiple working conditions and high data acquisition costs, A twin model construction method for unbalanced vibration in rotor systems based on random forests is proposed in this paper to achieve rapid prediction of the unbalance or vibration response. Based on the finite element dynamic model, the characteristic data are obtained by applying unbalanced excitation through harmonic response analysis. On the basis of considering the dynamic characteristics of the rotor system, the key node features are extracted based on K-means clustering sampling. According to the requirements of different application scenarios, a three-level prediction twin model is constructed based on the dynamic characteristics of key nodes after order reduction: Model I for predicting unbalance, Model II for predicting both unbalance and rotational frequency simultaneously, and Model III for predicting the frequency response function covering the entire frequency band. Taking the finite element model of a certain rotor system as an example for verification, the results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of Model I in the unbalance prediction is 0.1726 g•m, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.15 g•m. In the rotational frequency prediction of Model II, the error does not exceed 0.9 Hz. The RMSE of the unbalance prediction is 0.1504 g•m, and the MAE is 0.116 g•m. In the frequency response function prediction of Model III, the Pearson correlation coefficients of each measurement point are all higher than 0.98. The validation results indicate that the proposed method has good prediction accuracy and practical engineering value. The established twin model can support unbalanced excitation vibration state analysis and virtual dynamic balancing based on limited measured data from selected monitoring points."

The technical method proposed in this study provides an effective solution for the online identification and assessment of weld damage in high-temperature coke towers, which is of great theoretical and practical significance for ensuring the safe operation of petrochemical equipment."

Therefore, in this study, we introduce a support vector machine (SVM), a type of machine learning technique, in particular 1vs1SVM. Furthermore, we propose fusing the amplitude and phase spectra, which were treated separately, at the feature, score, and decision levels. Consequently, we achieved a verification error of approximately 11 % in AND fusion at the decision level."

There is an urgent need for means that may accomplish more with less, methods that are both accurate and productive. Precision agriculture responds to this demand by rethinking farming in a subtle but profound way. At its core is a strong engineering approach that uses intelligent infrastructure to reinvent agricultural work rather than just support it. Decisions go from assumption to calculation, fields become networks, and machines become more observant. Sensors, autonomous systems, and networked platforms are examples of technologies that function as the foundation of contemporary farming. This is a shift in mindset as much as a change in tools, where understanding rather than force is used to acquire control and responsiveness takes the place of reaction. Previously influenced by fate and will, the field is now directed by design."

In this work, we propose an AI-enhanced combined concentrationtoxicity model (AI-AugETM), which is extended on basis of the existing pharmacokinetic-toxicity combination model, and integrates deep learning technology and uncertainty inference methods, which is suitable for the modeling and evaluation of new dose pathways. Initially, the model is based on multi-source input data, and uses multi-task time series models to jointly model toxicity probability and time-varying evolution of toxicity grades, and learn the concentration-toxicity response curve under multidose pathways. Based on the results of the response curve, Bayesian uncertainty estimation and Shapley value interpretation mechanism are used to derive the effective exposure range and safety upper bound at the individual level, which can be used to assist in formulating the optimal dose range and safe upper dose limit, ensuring efficacy and controlling toxicity risk. The results show that AI-AugETM significantly improves the accuracy of toxicity prediction in pharmacokinetic toxicity combination data, and effectively narrows exposure decision boundary within 95% confidence interval."

The architecture integrates segmented adaptive control of the rotational inertia J with online adaptive control of the damping coefficient D (based on an RBF neural network), aimed at improving frequency stability and disturbance rejection capability under wind-storage system dominated conditions. Based on the small-signal model of the VSG active power loop and power angle-frequency analysis, the adaptive segmented control law for J is derived, and the online adaptive strategy for D is designed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the hierarchical adaptive strategy: under simulated wind/photovoltaic typical output fluctuation conditions, compared with fixed-parameter control, the proposed strategy significantly improves system stability and dynamic performance, reduces frequency overshoot by more than 26%; and shortens the regulation time by about 50%. This provides a feasible adaptive control solution for the practical implementation of VSGs in high-penetration renewable energy systems."

The theoretical foundations of time-domain and frequency-domain analysis are first systematically examined. Then an experimental platform is established to collect vibration signals under various operating conditions, followed by comprehensive signal processing using statistical values and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The results indicate that fault signals exhibit lower RMS values but higher kurtosis than normal signals, with amplitude and frequency fluctuations intensifying under increased load and speed. Unilateral spectral analysis reveals abnormal vibrations near fault characteristic frequencies. Theoretical derivation determined the characteristic fault frequency for flexspline tooth wear to be 49.5098Hz. Experimental spectral analysis reveals that at this characteristic frequency, the amplitude of fault signals substantially exceeds that of normal signals, serving as a distinctive identification feature. The study demonstrates that traditional time-frequency analysis effectively extracts fault features in harmonic drives, offering valuable insights for early fault detection in industrial robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Lithium-Ion batteries are widely used in a variety of critical applications due to their excellent energy density and low self-discharge rate. Ensuring their reliable operation is essential for both economic performance and operational safety. Among the various tasks in battery health management, accurately predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is one of the most critical. However, current RUL prediction methods face significant challenges due to high nonlinearity, data dispersion, and coupled degradation among monitored parameters. To address these issues, this study proposes an RUL prediction method based on a nonlinear Wiener process and time-varying correlation model for lithiumion batteries. An improved Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is introduced to achieve more accurate parameter estimation of the nonlinear Wiener process. And an adaptive time-varying Copula modeling method is employed to capture the dynamic correlations among degradation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively estimates the nonlinear Wiener process parameters for two key degradation parameters: discharge capacity and internal resistance. Furthermore, modeling their time-varying correlation structure improves the RUL prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a task that simultaneously predicts the occupancy and semantic labels of the environment. Compared with separate processing, SSC leverages the coupled nature of scene completion and semantic segmentation. Although this multitask integration can utilize complementarity and correlation between tasks, it also increases the training difficulty. To address this, in this paper, we propose a Semantic Decoupling based Semantic Scene Completion (SD-SSC) network from a single depth image. The semantic segmentation task is decoupled from the semantic scene completion task, and we use 2D and 3D semantic supervision to simplify the scene completion task and improve SSC performance. Specifically, our network first performs 2D semantic segmentation on the depth image and transforms features into 3D voxel space as semantic priors. Then, the 3D SSC is performed based on the voxel features and the flipped Truncated Signed Distance Field (f-TSDF). We use multi-scale 3D semantic supervision to further enhance the semantic information and fuse semantic and geometric features through the Planar Attention Fusion Module (PAFM) to obtain accurate SSC results. The proposed SD-SSC network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYU dataset (51.1% mIoU) and the NYUCAD dataset (61.9% mIoU) among all single depth-image based methods. It is even better than most RGB-D fusion-based SSC methods.

    "abstract": "Early detection of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity remains a critical challenge, hindered by the scarcity of large and balanced datasets combining Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) and clinical information. This study introduces a conditional Diffusion-VAE hybrid that generates high-fidelity synthetic TDI images conditioned on clinical vectors, enabling robust data augmentation for cardiotoxicity prediction. A skip-connected Convolutional VAE (ConvVAE) first encodes each 2D TDI scan into a structured 256 × 10 × 24 latent tensor. After freezing the encoder, a cross-attention–conditioned U-Net iteratively denoises these latents under clinical guidance (27 features). Compared to the ConvVAE alone, the proposed Diffusion-VAE achieves a 55% reduction in MSE (0.0022 to 0.0010), a 20% improvement in FID (10.2 to 8.7), and gains in SSIM (0.96 to 0.98), PSNR (32.0 dB to 34.5 dB), and LPIPS (0.083 to 0.058), validating its superior fidelity and diversity. Bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 resamples) confirmed statistical robustness, while a permutation test (10,000 shuffles) demonstrated the significance of AUC and PR-AUC improvements (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.01). Grad-CAM and SHAP visualizations highlight that the model attends to physiologically meaningful Doppler envelope regions and influential clinical variables such as heart rate and ejection fraction. Classifiers retrained solely on synthetic data achieved 97.9% accuracy, 0.991 ROC-AUC, and 0.982 PR-AUC, underscoring the utility of the proposed model for overcoming data scarcity. This hybrid architecture, combining VAE’s structured representation with diffusion’s refinement capabilities, offers a scalable multimodal augmentation engine to advance reliable AI in cardiovascular oncology."

    "abstract": "The Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) has been witnessed to improve the performance of ground information retrieval. Yet, extracting high-precision ground photons over expansive areas remains a significant challenge, particularly in forested regions with steep slopes. Ground photons can not be extracted correctly in a large slope area because of the unclear spatial distribution difference between ground and canopy photons. To address the abovementioned issue, we propose a novel slope correction method to extract ground photons for sub-canopy terrain retrieval accurately. Our approach begins with a way to find the terrain trend of the photon cloud. Turning points are then identified from the generated terrain trend to segment the signal photon cloud into distinct terrain regions. We detrend the photon cloud in each segment by a horizontal rotation, making the spatial distribution of ground and canopy photons clear. Finally, an iterative method based on the percentile range of photons’ elevation to extract fine ground photons. We validated the proposed method using nine datasets from three rugged forest areas. The filtering process effectively denoised photon cloud data, while turning point detection achieved high accuracy, with F-scores ranging from 0.89 to 0.98. Terrain retrieval results demonstrated remarkable accuracy, yielding RMSE values of 3.82 m, 3.61 m, and 2.45 m across the study areas. Ablation experiments underscored the effectiveness of the slope correction and ground photon extraction techniques, showing RMSE reductions of 10.6%, 6.5%, and 3.6% after slope correction and a decrease in unusable terrain ratios (Inv+Res>3) by 8.1%, 3.6%, and 20%. Compared to conventional methods, our approach reduced RMSE values (from 0.55 m to 2.61 m) and Inv+Res>3 ratios (from 0.04 to 0.37). Furthermore, the method outperformed ATL08 terrain estimates, providing superior accuracy in sub-canopy terrain reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Consumer devices that are integrated into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems are becoming more susceptible to the sophisticated intrusion attacks, which are a major threat to user safety and the overall integrity of the system. Federated Learning (FL) has been a prominent technique for collaborative training models while maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information. In addition, conventional FL-based IDS approaches have problems to handle non-identical IID (IID) data distributions across clients, and usually use a fixed aggregation method like FedAvg and FedProx, which has poor adaptability to changeable client behaviors. To tackle these limitations, this research proposes an adaptive federated learning framework by preprocessing IoVs network traffic through standardization and IID (independent and identical distributed) distribution of data among clients. A Temporal Hybrid Deep Model (CNN-LSTM-Attention) is trained on each client locally (starting from the global model). After training, client models and performance metrics are updated to a central server, where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) optimally decides aggregation weights based on client Q-values, which maximizes global accuracy as a reward. Iterative aggregation greatly improves intrusion detection performance, with detection accuracies of 99.85% and 95.18% on the benchmark datasets CICIOV2024 and CICEVSE2024, respectively. The proposed method makes it possible to develop a lightweight, edge-deployable intrusion detection system for consumer IoV device like telematics and electric car chargers. By leveraging federated learning, the approach provides real-time, privacy-preserving protection."

    "abstract": "Solar PhotoVoltaic (PV) installations have rapidly increased due to the growing awareness of global warming. However, fluctuations in PV generation and load cause voltage violations in the Distribution Network (DN), complicating prediction and system management. To address this issue, this paper proposes a predictive management system for controlling the On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) and Capacitor Bank (CAP) in advance to resolve voltage violations. The proposed method is designed by using the integration of an adaptive forecasting model and metaheuristic algorithm in a 30-minute-ahead control task. The adaptive forecasting model is developed using the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to decompose historical data into low-frequency and high-frequency components. Each component is used to train and test a standalone Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The values forecasted by all LSTMs are then reconstructed as the PV power or load of the DN. Subsequently, the 30-minute-ahead PV power and load values forecasted by the proposed forecasting model are applied in the optimization process using the Discrete Differential Evolution Algorithm (DDE) to properly control the 30-minute-ahead operation of the OLTC and CAP while minimizing the costs associated with line losses, transformer losses, and OLTC and CAP step changes. Simulations on the modified IEEE-123 bus test feeder demonstrate that the proposed method reduces total costs by 10.21% and 6.31% compared to the basic control method on the day with the maximum PV generation and the peak load, and on a randomly selected day, respectively."

However, existing credential systems often depend on centralized issuers, lack efficient aggregation mechanisms, or fail to ensure unlinkability across authentication sessions. To address these challenges, we propose DISC (Decentralized Identity System with Self-Sovereign Credential Aggregation), a novel credential system that enables multi-authority credential issuance, user-controlled credential aggregation, and unlinkable authentication. DISC allows users to aggregate credentials from multiple issuers while maintaining constant-size authentication tokens and supporting batch verification for scalable authentication. Additionally, DISC ensures unlinkability of aggregated authentication tokens, preventing verifiers from correlating sessions even when credentials share attributes. Security analysis proves DISC’s unforgeability, anonymity, and unlinkability, while experimental results confirm its efficiency in credential issuance, aggregation, and verification. Compared to existing schemes, DISC offers a scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient decentralized identity solution, making it well-suited for real-world applications requiring secure and privacy-preserving identity verification."

Insurance serves as a vital financial buffer, compensating smallholder farmers' input costs while also enhancing their ability to repay loans. Traditional insurance, due to lengthy verification and delayed payouts, limits the farmers' quick response to extreme weather. Recently, smart insurance has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging index-based verification and automated payouts to facilitate timely farmer recovery. This study explores the operation of an e-commerce-based ASC under extreme weather, considering dual protection of crop insurance (traditional or smart) and government subsidies (premium or input). We examine the insurer's decision to adopt smart insurance and its alignment with the socially optimal outcome. Our results show that when farmer recovery efficiency is low, smart insurance is preferred only if traditional verification incurs high costs. Conversely, with efficient farmer recovery, the insurer always adopts smart insurance, which empowers the ASC to sustain under severe weather conditions but may lead to a decline in social welfare due to the associated subsidy expenditure. Furthermore, we analyze the implications of insurance innovation for government subsidy policies. We find that smart insurance can resolve the policy dilemma faced by traditional insurance, where no policy can outperform the other in both farmer well-being and social welfare under severe weather conditions. In contrast, smart insurance enables the input subsidy to achieve a dual-benefit outcome. This finding highlights the potential of insurance innovation in improving government policy effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN-HEMTs) enable fast switching commutation due to their small parasitic capacitances, which necessitates the effective gate driving techniques. Gate drivers with split-output topology offer advantages such as reducing the risk of false turn-ON and minimizing the size of gate loop. However, the output capacitance of gate driver in this configuration may reduce the commutation speed of GaN-HEMTs, and values of this capacitance are overlooked in the gate driver datasheets. This paper highlights the critical role of gate driver output capacitance on the switching performance of GaN-HEMTs, which has been discussed by proposing an analytical model and demonstrated through both simulations and experiments. The results show that this capacitance can slow down the switching speed specifically in the split-output gate driver configurations, leading to inaccurate switching waveform predictions. Furthermore, a measurement method and corresponding output capacitance data for a series of commercially available gate drivers are presented. These findings offer practical guidance for gate driver selection in GaN-HEMT applications."

    "abstract": "Drilling is an essential procedure in many orthopedic surgeries. Especially in femoral neck fracture surgery, any loss of control can lead to secondary injury to the patient. Consequently, it is imperative for orthopaedists to undergo extensive training to master the appropriate haptic interaction. In this work, a virtual drilling surgery training system with high-fidelity haptic feedback is developed for femoral neck fracture. First, to achieve realistic visual rendering, the external boundary of femur is reconstructed using Triple dexel, allowing for fast and realistic surface reconstruction. Next, the heterogeneous and hierarchical structure of femur is reconstructed using multi-morphology with three periodic minimal surface (TPMS) design approaches. Then, a haptic interaction algorithm based on Triple dexel and TPMS is proposed. This algorithm uses the TPMS equations to quickly compute the densities of the bone chips produced by Triple dexel Boolean operations, thus simulating the variation in porosity at different positions of the bone and providing precise haptic feedback during the drilling process. Finally, a robotic experimental platform is established, and the proposed force model is verified using bovine bones. The results show that the measured values are consistent with the experimental values. Furthermore, evaluation of the training system with medical students as participants shows that a fine haptic rendering improves users' hand-eye coordination skills."

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted therapy has long promised to advance stroke rehabilitation by delivering intensive and personalized training, yet its clinical impact remains limited. Closing the sensorimotor loop with brain-computer interfaces offers a better strategy than passive mobilization, directly linking user intent to robotic assistance and potentially driving neuroplasticity. However, a brain-computer interface requires subject-specific calibration that is time-consuming and often impractical. Moreover, brain decoding remains error-prone due to variability of neural signals, thus resulting in unintended robot actions that could reduce engagement during closed-loop control. Here, we demonstrate that a decoder trained on an expert subject can be transferred to naïve users for online control of a rehabilitation exoskeleton in a rest-versus-reaching paradigm, a functional task with clinical relevance. We then characterize error-related potentials arising from expectation mismatches between brain commands and robot actions during closed-loop control. Finally, we show that these mismatches can be reliably decoded in a subject-independent framework (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.77), a crucial step toward rehabilitation scenarios where collecting subject-specific error-related potential data is challenging. Our findings highlight the potential for integrating real-time error-detection to enhance human-robot interaction by correcting unintended robot behaviors, which could significantly improve rehabilitation outcomes where accurate and contingent feedback is essential."

    "abstract": "Microscale metal fabrication for microelectronics, sensors, and MEMS devices requires precise automated positioning and shape control, particularly challenging on conductive substrates where non-transparency limits conventional vision-based positioning. This paper presents a high-precision vision-guided automated electrochemical 3D printing system that integrates meniscus-confined electrodeposition (MCED) with real-time visual feedback for accurate microscale metal fabrication in air. The system employs a cantilevered micropipette design to avoid obstructing the top-view field, combined with a vision-guided tracking algorithm using closed-loop feedback control to achieve 1.24 μm positioning accuracy with a relative positioning error of 5.17% on non-transparent conductive substrates. An integrated substrate calibration method based on four-point plane fitting and coordinate transformation compensates for surface irregularities and assembly errors, reducing angular deviations to 3.2%. The self-adjusting voxelated MCED approach utilizes pre-defined trajectories to ensure consistent structural geometry despite environmental variations. Experimental validation demonstrates fabrication of complex microscale structures including intersections, arrays, and controlled electrode interconnections. The integrated vision-guidance, automated calibration, and adaptive deposition control establish this system as an automated solution for refined microscale metal fabrication."

A three-agent topology framework of microgrid operators, user aggregators and shared energy storage operators is constructed. Based on the Stackelberg master-slave game model, the interaction between the pricing strategy of microgrid operators and the user-side load optimization is described : the upper microgrid operators optimize the time-sharing electricity / heat price through genetic algorithm, the lower user aggregators combine the shared energy storage leasing cost and flexible load regulation, and use the Cplex solver to optimize the electricity / heat load distribution and energy storage charging and discharging strategy. The results of the example verify the effectiveness of the model in improving system economy and user-side flexibility."
