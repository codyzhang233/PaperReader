    "abstract": "An electric vehicle (EV) fast charging unit usually consists of multiple modules connected in parallel to share the total current among them and achieve high power ratings. In this article, a charging unit with multiple parallel single active bridge (SAB) converter modules is considered and a novel nonlinear resilient controller (NLRC) is proposed to achieve all of the following properties: 1) accurate current sharing among multiple SAB modules during normal operation; 2) inherently limit the instantaneous current of each module within a given range at all times; 3) rigorously guarantee closed-loop system stability; and 4) enhance the charging unit resilience under abnormal operation (e.g., module set-point attack and sensor/measurement fault). Using nonlinear analysis and invariant set theory, the boundedness of the instantaneous current for each SAB module is rigorously proved. Furthermore, closed-loop system stability is analytically shown based on matrix properties independently of the charging unit or controller parameters, opposed to conventional root-locus analysis that relies on a specific set of system parameters. Moreover, the resilience property of the novel NLRC is analytically articulated in the case where one or more modules are compromised due to set-point attack or sensor/communication failures. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated against the state-of-the-art control structures using both simulation and a suitable experimental testbed for both normal and abnormal scenarios, including an experimental implementation of an entire charging session (typical EV battery charging curve)."

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between dimensions of work culture and the well-being of hotel employees using discriminant analysis. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire distributed across various departments and job levels, measuring key constructs including job satisfaction (JS), subjective well-being (SWB), social support (SS), supportive practices (SP), and motivation (M), with validated instruments ensuring data reliability. Unlike most hospitality research, which often relies on correlation or regression-based methods, this study introduces discriminant analysis as a predictive classification approach, addressing a methodological gap in employee well-being research. The discriminant model classified employees into distinct psychological and organizational profiles, with the first two discriminant functions explaining 93.33% of the total variance. Results confirmed that both organizational culture factors (such as SP and SS) and personal factors (such as motivation and well-being) significantly differentiate employee groups. These findings underscore the importance of fostering a supportive work environment and implementing policies that improve both job satisfaction and psychological health. For hospitality managers and HR professionals, the results provide actionable insights to improve employee engagement, reduce burnout, and ultimately improve service quality in the industry."

    "abstract": "This research develops a deep learning system for identifying tomato leaf diseases by combining multiple image processing techniques with advanced neural networks. The approach takes input images and creates three different versions: the original RGB photo, a segmentation mask that isolates just the leaf area, and contrast-enhanced version made using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). These three image types get merged together and fed into modified versions of established CNN models - ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2. The models also use data augmentation with various geometric and lighting changes to help them work better on new images. Results show that using this combined input approach boosts classification performance across all the neural network models, with EfficientNetB0 reaching the best F 1 -score of 0.999. The leaf segmentation part, done with U-Net and U-Net using FP32 precision, accurately separates leaves from backgrounds with Dice scores over 0.98. The complete system handles real-world challenges well, including different surface textures, lighting conditions, and leaf orientations that farmers encounter in the field. The main contribution here is bringing together semantic understanding, structural information, and visual details in one classification system, creating a practical tool for automated disease detection in modern farming. Future work could focus on making this run on mobile devices and adding AI explanation features so farmers can understand and trust the system's decisions better."

    "abstract": "Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network (LASFNet). The LASFNet adopts a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance detection, thereby simplifying the training process. The attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module in the model adaptively adjusts the responses of fused features at both global and local levels, promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation. Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves a favorable efficiency–accuracy tradeoff. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, LASFNet reduced the number of parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively, while improving detection accuracy mean average precision (mAP) by 1%–3%.

    "abstract": "Precisely modeling radio propagation in complex environments has been a significant challenge, especially with the advent of 5G and beyond networks, where managing massive antenna arrays demands more detailed information. Traditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall short, either due to insufficient details or because of challenges for real-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting method in the computer vision domain, which outperforms other methods in reconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach that enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from sparse samples. RF-3DGS offers high efficiency, requiring only a few minutes for training and achieving fast inference for any arbitrary receiver pose within milliseconds. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained Spatial Channel State Information (Spatial-CSI) of these paths, including the channel gain, the delay, the angle of arrival (AoA), and the angle of departure (AoD). Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate that RF-3DGS not only significantly improves reconstruction quality, training efficiency, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also holds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced applications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC).

Existing sensor placement strategies for three-dimensional (3-D) angle-of-arrival (AOA) localization have not accounted for general convex deployment constraints. This paper extends and improves a recently proposed block majorization-minimization (block-MM) method for 3-D AOA sensor placement, making it capable of handling general convex deployment constraints for AOA sensors. Specifically, we formulate the problem based on the A-optimality criterion, and each sensor's position is subject to the constraint of lying within a pre-defined deployment constraint set. We derive a quadratic surrogate function for the formulated problem. The method guarantees a successive reduction in the objective function value until convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively find an appropriate sensor-target geometry that enhances performance."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication receives significant attention for its ability to efficiently transmit meaningful information rather than pursuing bit-level accuracy, thereby minimizing resource consumption. However, in addition to wireless channel interference, this paradigm is vulnerable to semantic impairments caused by adversarial attacks. Recent advances in deep learning-based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) significantly improve communication robustness against physical channel noise but often overlook semantic-level perturbations. In this paper, we propose a wavelet transform frequency-domain attention feature (WTAF) module, which employs multilevel wavelet decomposition to effectively separate semantic structures from high-frequency adversarial noise. It also incorporates a channel-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adapts semantic feature extraction based on real-time channel conditions. We integrate WTAF to design a JSCC model for robust image semantic communication under adversarial interference and wireless channel interference conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed JSCC scheme outperforms existing JSCC models and traditional separate source-channel coding in terms of reconstruction quality, semantic integrity, and overall robustness, particularly under severe semantic degradation."

    "abstract": "Multiphase and multi-component fluid flows are highly intricate, exhibiting dynamic behaviors that challenge conventional simulation methods, especially across a wide range of operating conditions. Adding fluid-solid interactions further escalates this complexity, requiring simulations that are both physically accurate and computationally more tractable. Existing methods often fall short in aspects of either accuracy, efficiency, or stability, and sometimes may also consume excessive memory, rendering them unsuitable for many practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel, more practical solution combining a collision-enhanced lattice Boltzmann method with a finite-volume approach. This hybrid solver is designed to effectively simulate multiphase, multi-component flows via the phase-field modeling with a novel wetting boundary treatment in the finite-volume framework, while significantly reducing memory consumption. It enables simulations of multiple fluid phases under varied conditions, capturing rich interfacial behaviors. Additionally, it incorporates an immersed-boundary method to efficiently handle complex fluid-solid interactions. Validation tests confirm that our method produces physically consistent results and demonstrates accuracy across multiple evaluations. We provide comprehensive simulation results, along with comparisons of memory consumption and efficiency, highlighting the practical utility and superiority of our solver over conventional methods."

To bridge this gap, the concept of Dynamic Hosting Capacity (DHC), enabling spatiotemporal characterization of distribution network constraints to optimize GAI data center integration. Detailed phase-specific power consumption models are established for LLM data centers, systematically quantifying their multidimensional spatiotemporal impact on DN safety margins through high-dimensional feasible region analysis. Furthermore, an efficient DHC characterization method based on the projection equivalence theory is introduced, which maps the high-dimensional feasible region onto the node-level dynamic hosting capacity indicators of the GAI interconnection nodes. Case studies based on a modified IEEE 33-bus feeder validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Drug combination therapy has exhibited favorable effects in treating cancer patients, with less toxicity and adverse reactions compared to monotherapy. To accelerate the discovery of therapeutic drug combinations, numerous computational methods have been developed to predict drug synergy in cancer cell lines, typically modeling the task as binary classification (synergistic vs non-synergistic) or regression (continuous synergy scores). Yet, a recent study proposes categorizing drug combination benefits into multiple ordered classes (e.g., synergy, bliss additivity, independent actions) based on clinical activities, and suggests that drug combinations remain valuable if they reduce cancer cell viability, even without defined synergy. To distinguish various levels of combination benefits, we present a novel order-aware deep learning model, called OrderCombo. Specifically, OrderCombo extracts the drug representation via a pretrained chemical language model and the cell line representation via an omics-oriented linear network. Then, these representations are fused into a unified embedding for each drug-drug-cell line triplet, by leveraging a hybrid encoder that combines concatenation-based dependencies and attention-based interactions. Finally, an ordinal contrastive loss is designed to promote a discriminative embedding space and maintain class ordinality, thereby improving the predictions of drug combination benefits. We evaluate OrderCombo on a large-scale combination benefit dataset, and in silico results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of prediction accuracy, while maintaining robust generalization to unseen drug pairs and cell lines. Substantial case studies further demonstrate OrderCombo's potential value in discovering novel anticancer drug combinations across different therapeutic levels."

    "abstract": "Existing unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) methods obtain pseudo-labels mainly by clustering to optimize the model. Most methods only use clustered instances to provide supervised information for model training without considering the possible value information of un-clustered outliers. Some methods use un-clustered outliers for training and show promising results, but their strategies for using un-clustered outliers are limited in applicability. Furthermore, unsatisfactory feature embedding and imperfect clustering cannot guarantee that instances within clusters have the same identity, resulting in generated pseudo-labels containing noise. To solve the above problems, outliers adaptation exploration (OAE) and centroids matching label refinement (CMLR) are proposed in this paper. First, OAE is designed to explore the value information of un-clustered outliers. OAE implements the nearest clustered instance neighborhood constraint and the maximum centroid distance constraint on the un-clustered outliers based on the feature distribution to update the clusters, thereby achieving a healthy balance between the number of training samples and model accuracy. Second, CMLR is proposed to alleviate the inherent noise in pseudo-labels. CMLR considers the similarity relationship between clustered instances and clusters in accordance with the cluster distribution to refine pseudo-labels, prompting features to learn from probability distributions with cluster distribution similarity relationship information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation settings."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of data center infrastructure is reshaping power system dynamics by significantly increasing electricity demand while also offering potential for fast and controllable flexibility. To ensure reliable operation under such conditions, the frequency-secured unit commitment (Safe UC) problem must be solved with enhanced modeling of demand-side frequency response. In this work, we propose a data-driven linearization framework based on decision tree–based constraint learning (DT-CL) to embed nonlinear nadir frequency constraints into mixed- integer linear programming (MILP). This approach enables tractable co-optimization of generation schedules and fast frequency response (FFR) from data centers. Through case studies on both a benchmark system and a 2030 future scenario with higher DC penetration, we demonstrate that increasing the proportion of flexible DC load consistently improves system cost efficiency and supports renewable integration. However, this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns, motivating the introduction of the Marginal Flexibility Value (MFV) metric to quantify the economic value of additional flexibility. The results highlight that as DCs become a larger share of system load, their active participation in frequency response will be increasingly indispensable for maintaining both economic and secure system operations."

While extensive research has been conducted in this field, the challenge of coordinating multiple robots to flow collectively from one side of the map to the other—such as in crossing missions through obstacle-rich spaces—has received limited attention. This paper focuses on this directional traversal scenario by introducing a real-time scheduling scheme that enables multi-robot systems to move from edge to edge, emulating the smooth and efficient flow of water. Inspired by network flow optimization, our scheme decomposes the environment into a flow-based network structure, enabling the efficient allocation of robots to paths based on real-time congestion levels. The proposed scheduling planner operates on top of existing collision avoidance algorithms, aiming to minimize overall traversal time by balancing detours and waiting times. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving fast and coordinated traversal. Furthermore, real-world flight tests with ten drones validate its practical feasibility.

In this paper, we propose <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SeeFormer</b>, a novel contour autoregressive paradigm specifically designed for RRSECS, which accurately locates and segments micro, irregular targets in remote sensing imagery. We first introduce a brain-inspired feature refocus learning (BIFRL) module that progressively attends to effective object features via a coarse-to-fine scheme, significantly boosting small-object localization and segmentation. Next, we present a language-contour enhancer (LCE) that injects shape-aware contour priors, and a corner-based contour sampler (CBCS) to improve mask-polygon reconstruction fidelity. Finally, we develop an autoregressive dual-decoder paradigm (ARDDP) that preserves sequence consistency while alleviating multi-task optimization conflicts. Extensive experiments on RefDIOR, RRSIS-D, and OPT-RSVG datasets under varying scenarios, scales, and task paradigms demonstrate transformative performance gains: compared to the baseline PolyFormer, our proposed SeeFormer improves oIoU and mIoU by 27.58% and 39.37% for referring image segmentation and by 18.94% and 28.90% for visual grounding on the RefDIOR dataset.

According to the Badan Pusat Statistik, several provinces in Indonesia, including three on the island of Java, namely DKI Jakarta, West Java, and Banten, still do not meet the criteria for adequate housing. An approach to analyze the disparity in the percentage of adequate housing on the island of Java can be carried out by clustering regencies/municipalities based on the 2024 adequate housing indicators to identify regions that have not yet met housing adequacy targets. This study uses the K-Medoids clustering algorithm and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering Algorithm with Noise (DBSCAN) because they are more robust against outliers and use Euclidean distance calculations. The K-medoids algorithm groups objects based on the shortest distance to the medoids as the cluster centers. The DBSCAN algorithm groups objects based on the density within a given area. The clustering results were validated using the Silhouette Index. A higher Silhouette Index value indicates better clustering performance. Based on the research, the K-Medoids algorithm formed an optimal number of two clusters with a Silhouette Index validation score of 0.5169, while the DBSCAN algorithm formed two optimal clusters and 29 noise points with a Silhouette Index validation score of 0.5853. The best clustering for regencies/municipalities on the island of Java, based on the 2024 adequate housing indicator, is two clusters and 29 noise points using the DBSCAN algorithm. The results may serve as a reference for the government to determine infrastructure and housing development priorities for lagging regions to achieve the SDGs."

    "abstract": "This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by incorporating Information Quality (IQ) from the Information System Success model and Autonomy (AUTO) from Self-Determination Theory, offering a more holistic framework that combines technical and motivational factors. While prior TAM-based research on mobile learning largely emphasized perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), the joint influence of IQ and autonomy has received limited attention. Using PLS-SEM on survey data from 138 users of mobile language learning applications, the results show that IQ and PEOU significantly predict PU, while PU and autonomy strongly influence behavioral intention to use (BIU). BIU, in turn, robustly predicts actual system use (AU). The extended model explains <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6 1 \\%}$</tex> of BIU and 52% of AU variance, demonstrating its explanatory strength. Theoretically, the findings advance TAM by integrating informational and motivational dimensions. Practically, they suggest that developers should emphasize high-quality content, tangible learning benefits, and features that enhance learner autonomy to promote adoption and sustained engagement. Limitations include a young sample and self-reported data; future research should test the model across diverse demographics and contexts."

    "abstract": "The electromagnetic signals generated during the coal rock loading process are prone to interference from environmental noise, making direct analysis difficult. To effectively extract the electromagnetic radiation characteristics during the fracture process, this paper proposes a modal component optimization method based on the multi-strategy improved black-wing kite algorithm (IBKA), the smooth-peak feature fusion classification (SPMF), and combines wavelet adaptive threshold denoising and CEEMDAN decomposition to construct the IBKA-CEEMDAN-SPMF joint denoising framework. By superimposing the spindle-shaped oscillation wave-form and the trend term to construct the simulated signal, the performance of each stage of the algorithm was systematically simulated and verified through single-axis loading experiments. The results show that the improved IBKA increases the convergence speed of CEEMDAN decomposition by 15% and improves the accuracy by 8.3%; the SPMF classification method can achieve more stable and reliable signal reconstruction; compared with other methods, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 13 dB. IBKA-CEEMDAN-SPMF shows excellent denoising ability in both simulated and measured signals, and the noise ratio of the denoised signal is the lowest at 0.0928, with the maximum noise ratio reduction of 53.9% compared to other comparison methods. The research proves that this method can be embedded in the precursory recognition models of time-domain, frequency-domain and mixed signals, providing effective technical support for the multi-source information fusion of coal rock dynamic disaster monitoring."

This device measures the user's body tilt angle in real-time and sends the data to the Blynk application and website, providing alerts when the posture is poor. Experimental results show that this system effectively monitors body posture and provides timely notifications with an average time of 1.172 milliseconds, hoping to help users develop healthier sitting habits. Experimental results reviewed in terms of user comfort indicate that the device still needs to be developed, as it only scored 2.5 out of 5.

Diseases such as smallpox, AIDS, hepatitis, liver cancer, and cervical cancer often caused by the Human Papillomavirus can lead to fatal outcomes. Over the years, extensive research has focused on developing vaccines and antiviral drugs, which have successfully contained and, in some cases, eradicated viral infections. Recently, computational techniques, particularly machine learning algorithms, have made notable progress in identifying potential Antiviral Peptides (AVPs), thereby accelerating experimental validation for therapeutic applications. This study introduces machine learning techniques and a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model combined with three feature-encoding methods to predict whether a protein sequence contains effective antiviral peptides. Eight machine learning algorithms were evaluated using both single-feature and combined feature encodings. Among them, the lightweight LGBM model trained on combined encoded features achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 97%, recall of 98%, F1-score of 98%, and an AUC of 1.00. Compared to existing models, the proposed approach achieved approximately 2% higher accuracy using individual encoding methods and about 3% higher accuracy with combined features. The reliability and effectiveness of the proposed model highlight its potential value for pharmaceutical development and academic research."

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of autonomous navigation for mobile robots in complex environments, many recent path planning methods employ a two-layer motion framework that integrates both global and local planning. However, global planning algorithms based on evolutionary algorithms often yield suboptimal paths, primarily due to premature convergence and wasted iterations in infeasible regions. Meanwhile, local planning algorithms, particularly the dynamic window approach (DWA) and its variants, are frequently tailored to specific scenarios, limiting their generalizability. To address these issues, this paper proposes an effective path planning method, namely M2PP. The global planning algorithm in M2PP enhances particle swarm optimization (PSO) by introducing multiple new search phases, creating a multi-phase PSO that can quickly identify feasible global paths and thoroughly explore the sampling space. To effectively handle multiple scenarios in a more generalized manner, the local planning component, multi-scenario adaptative DWA, integrates two novel terms into its cost function, enhancing both static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that multi-phase PSO exhibits strong performance and robustness, especially in highly complex scenarios, and multi-scenario adaptative DWA can generate safe and efficient local trajectories in hazardous conditions. Additionally, experiments deploying the M2PP method on a real-world mobile robot further confirm its feasibility."

    "abstract": "Multi-label feature selection solves the high-dimensional challenge problem in multi-label learning, and is widely used in pattern recognition, machine learning, and other related fields. However, most existing multi-label learning methods neglect the affinity between the features and the labels, which means the selected features may only provide categorization information for some of the labels rather than for all of them, resulting in one portion of labels obtaining sufficient categorization information, while another portion of labels obtains insufficient categorization information. In order to address this issue, we propose a new method for multi-label feature selection. Firstly, we propose the notion of affinity, which states that features are biased to provide categorical information for labels. Secondly, we propose three new feature evaluation metrics, affinity-relevance, affinity-redundancy, and affinity-interaction, which evaluate features in three dimensions from an affinity perspective. Thirdly, a new feature evaluation function called feature affinity significance, as well as a feature selection algorithm based on MARAImAR are proposed. Finally, experimental results on 15 multi-label benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other nine representative multi-label feature selection methods."

The transmitter employs a circularly polarized (CP) 2×2 array of diagonally fed rectangular microstrip patches to ensure rotational misalignment tolerance and improved gain. At the receiver side, a new hexagonal complementary star-shaped resonator (HCSSR)-based RI-MTS with a refractive index of 17.0 at 5.8 GHz is integrated with a compact CP receiving antenna. The HRI-MTS collimates the incident electromagnetic wave, reduces beam divergence, and enhances antenna gain without the enlargement of its physical aperture. Consequently, the proposed system achieves a peak power transfer efficiency (PTE) improvement from 21.04% to 28.91%, and extends the effective power transfer range (PTE ≤ 5%) from 87 mm to 198 mm. This WPT architecture simultaneously provides strong tolerance to rotational, lateral, and angular misalignments, demonstrating its suitability for powering distributed IoT nodes and compact portable devices."

This paper presents the GFZTD (Gray Figure-based Zenith Tropospheric Delay prediction) model, which is built on Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (ConvLSTM) and self-attention mechanisms. The model converts three-dimensional (3-D) zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) grid products into multi-layer two-dimensional grayscale images for predictive analysis. Utilizing Global Forecast System (GFS) and ERA5 data from southeastern China and its adjacent seas in 2023, the GFZTD model is trained through seasonal slicing and stratification by altitude. This approach generates high spatio-temporal resolution ZTD 3-D grid products in near real-time. To evaluate the grid prediction results, ERA5 is used as the truth, with an overall RMSE of 1.35 cm, representing improvements of 26.5% and 71.0% over ZTD derived from GFS and GPT3 (Global Pressure and Temperature 3), respectively. The model also successfully mitigates regional extreme prediction errors in complex terrain environments for GFS. Additionally, when using VMF3 (Vienna Mapping Functions 3) post-processing products to assess ZTD prediction values at various stations, the GFZTD model shows an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.49 cm. This result indicates improvements of 13.1% and 69.4% compared to GFS and GPT3, respectively, underscoring the model's applicability at the station scale."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fault-tolerant independent pole control scheme for a zigzag modular multilevel converter (MMC) targeting bipolar medium-voltage direct-current (MVDC) distribution systems. An MMC which adopts a zigzag transformer as an AC grid interface transformer, namely zigzag MMC, has inherent bipole operation capability with unbalanced loads of positive and negative poles on the DC side. Nevertheless, this topology has not been thoroughly investigated for its ability to maintain independent control of each pole in the case of a fault in the other. With a conventional MMC control which relies on normal operation of both poles, a fault in a single pole is likely to impact the overall operation of the converter. To tackle this problem, the proposed control scheme separates the arm current controllers and energy balancing controllers within upper and lower arms individually. Additional power reference coupling is introduced to indirectly inject circulating currents when both poles are healthy like the conventional MMC. When a single pole fault occurs, a seamless energy-balancing mode transition can be achieved by modifying inputs to current reference calculators. An AC-side single line-to-ground (SLG) fault ride through (FRT) strategy can also be integrated without compromising the independence of both poles. A point-to-point zigzag-MMC based bipolar MVDC distribution system is tested by controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) test setup. The test results under single pole-to-ground (PtG) fault and AC SLG fault validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Moreover, experimental results using a downscaled MMC prototype and a zigzag transformer further demonstrate the performance of the proposed control scheme under abrupt single-pole blocking and AC SLG fault conditions."

However, conventional image-domain methods suffer from noise amplification, thus reducing signal-to-noise ratio and compromising diagnostic accuracy.

To address these issues, this work explores the feasibility of weakly supervised methods and proposes a denoising prior guided weakly supervised learning framework, DPD-DEMD, to achieve high-accuracy image-domain dual-energy material decomposition. DPD-DEMD utilizes pretrained CT denoising models to construct robust priors for our dual energy material decomposition task. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive confidence mask mechanism for pseudo label generation and a multi-prior fusion strategy, thereby substantially improving the stability and reliability of the weakly supervised learning process. In addition, we fully exploit the correlation between dual energy images and further propose global-local regularization loss to improve the material decomposition accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulated and clinical datasets verify the superior performance and robustness of the proposed method, thereby demonstrating its potential clinical value in material decomposition.

In response to the challenges posed by frequent modifications in driving weights and their subsequent burden on human drivers, this article proposes a strategy that integrates fixed initial weights with dynamic adjustments to driver–automation driving weights. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation method including subjective and objective evaluation indexes is proposed. Different drivers are invited to perform virtual driving experiments, and the experimental results are analyzed by the proposed evaluation method. It is concluded that the driver’s driving weight should be kept at a high level during cooperative steering control when the driver’s intention cannot be perfectly obtained, and the determination of the driving weight should also consider the driver’s driving skills."

VoxelMap and its variants typically fit and check planes using all points in a voxel, which may lead to plane parameter deviation caused by outliers, over segmentation of large planes, and incorrect merging across different physical planes. To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging. Extensive experiments on diverse open-source LiDAR(-inertial) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) datasets validate that our method achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches, with comparable efficiency and memory usage.

    "abstract": "Incoherent k-space undersampling and deep learning-based reconstruction methods have shown great success in accelerating MRI. However, the performance of most previous methods will degrade dramatically under high acceleration factors, e.g., 8× or higher. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DM) have demonstrated promising results in solving this issue; however, one major drawback of the DM methods is the long inference time due to a dramatic number of iterative reverse posterior sampling steps. In this work, a Single Step Diffusion Model-based reconstruction framework, namely SSDM-MRI, is proposed for restoring MRI images from highly undersampled k-space. The proposed method achieves one-step reconstruction by first training a conditional DM and then iteratively distilling this model four times using an iterative selective distillation algorithm, which works synergistically with a shortcut reverse sampling strategy for model inference. Comprehensive experiments were carried out on both publicly available fastMRI brain and knee images, as well as an in-house multi-echo GRE (QSM) subject. Overall, the results showed that SSDM-MRI outperformed other methods in terms of numerical metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), error maps, image fine details, and latent susceptibility information hidden in MRI phase images. In addition, the reconstruction time for a 320×320 brain slice of SSDM-MRI is only 0.45 second, which is only comparable to that of a simple U-net, making it a highly effective solution for MRI reconstruction tasks."

    "abstract": "With the advantages of wide coverage and strong resource collaboration capabilities, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks has become a potential transmission scheme in the sixth generation (6G) communication system. To ensure flexible and seamless coverage, multi-beam scheme is widely used. Meanwhile, with the limitation of resources, multiple access techniques are introduced into satellite-terrestrial integrated networks for providing services to multiple users simultaneously. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), a popular multiple access technique that utilizes power domain superposition to significantly improve system performance, is widely employed. In order to achieve flexible interference management and further enhance spectral efficiency (SE) performance, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is proposed, which divides information streams into common parts and private parts. For satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, due to specific frequency band constraints and complexity of feedback link construction, channel estimation and information feedback are particularly difficult. Therefore, we consider introducing opportunistic selection into the existing RSMA scheme and propose a novel rate splitting opportunistic multiple access (RSOMA) system for satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. The proposed system utilizes opportunistic selection to combat imperfect CSI and obtain better SE performance. Statistical characteristics of equivalent channels are attained, and we reveal the closed-forms of SE and BER. To maximize the sum SE, a non-convex optimization problem is constructed and is separated into three sub-issues. Finally, a resource iteration optimization algorithm is applied to derive the optimal parameters. Numerical results reveal that the proposed RSOMA system can obtain excellent SE performance without perfect CSI."

    "abstract": "Extensive research has been done on the security of symmetric encryption algorithms in the black-box attack contexts, where the execution platforms are supposed to be secure. Recent studies intend to secure encryption algorithms in a more challenging but widely adopted scenario, the white-attack context (WBAC), where the adversaries have full visibility of the implementations of cryptosystems and full control over execution platforms. Various of approaches for protecting symmetric encryption algorithms in the WBAC have been proposed. Unfortunately, most existing approaches have been broken. This paper proposes a novel approach for securing symmetric encryption algorithms based on substitution-permutation network (SPN). Our key idea is to incorporate additional secret components into lookup tables to expand and dramatically change the inner states of encryption. Unlike existing approaches, these components do not need to be annihilated in adjacent rounds, and the ciphertext remains essentially unchanged. To recover the plaintext, only simple operations and the standard decryption algorithm are required. Our approach can be applied to protect SPN-based symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES. Security analysis indicates that the approach is expected to be resistant to both existing and unknown attacks. Furthermore, experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well on various platforms."

    "abstract": "Task matching is a core component of crowdsourcing systems, enabling efficient assignment of tasks to appropriate workers. However, this process often requires both task requesters and workers to disclose sensitive contextual information, such as spatial locations and temporal availability, raising serious privacy concerns. Although various cryptographic techniques and blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to preserve privacy and enhance trust, existing schemes still face three critical limitations: reliance on centralized key authorities, lack of support for fine-grained spatio-temporal constraints, and inefficient public verification mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose PVSTMatch, a blockchain-empowered privacy-preserving spatio-temporal task matching scheme in crowdsourcing. PVSTMatch eliminates the need for trusted third parties through an authority-free authorization mechanism, supports secure spatio-temporal matching by designing a compact secure comparison method, and enables efficient public verifiability via a succinct verification mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce GE-PVSTMatch, a gas-efficient variant that significantly reduces on-chain storage costs. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that our schemes achieve strong bilateral privacy, verification correctness, and practical efficiency, making them well-suited for real-world decentralized crowdsourcing platforms."

In order to achieve efficient and privacy-preserving certificate revocation list (CRL) synchronization, we propose ESGA, an efficient and secure geo-aware certificate revocation scheme for blockchain-based multi-domain VANETs. Since invalid vehicles are driving within specific edge domains during certain time periods, we design a hierarchical Geo-CRL structure comprising a blockchain-based global CRL and geographically distributed local CRLs. Furthermore, we design an adaptive geo-aware synchronization mechanism which enables timely local CRLs update, while ensuring periodic or event-driven updates of the global CRL on the blockchain. Finally, to protect the CRL information from pseudonym linking attacks, we design linkage values chain-based certificate revocation method for privacy preservation. The experimental results demonstrate that ESGA can significantly improve CRL synchronization efficiency with lower CRL query latency and storage overhead, and to protect the privacy of certificate revocation in blockchain-based multi-domain VANETs."

The sound-fork-shaped microstrip line is adopted to feed the CGDRA through the comb-slot. The bowl-shaped metal wall is arranged around the CGDR to enhance the gain and the 3.5 dB gain bandwidth. The proposed CGDRA is fabricated and measured to verify the design. The measurement results show the -10 dB impedance bandwidth of 95.7%, the peak gain of 8.58 dBi, the 3.5 dB gain bandwidth of 95.7% and the cross-polarization level of less than -25 dB in the operating frequency band. Due to these advantages of wide impedance bandwidth, high gain stability and low cross-polarization level, the proposed CGDRA will be an important candidate scheme for B5G/6G wideband mm-wave wireless communication applications."

This system features a synergistic integration of multimodal sensing units and feedback actuators to achieve high-fidelity human-machine interaction. In terms of gesture recognition, a Tattoo-Style Flexible Strain Sensor (TFSS) based on PDMS/MWCNT/AgNPs composite was fabricated. It exhibits high conformability and robust electrical performance, achieving a sensitivity of 1.39 and rapid response (65 ms), while maintaining excellent stability over 3000 cycles. In terms of the feedback loop, a Foam-based Flexible Pressure Sensor (FFPS) was developed with a sensitivity of 8.37×10⁻³ kPa⁻¹ and a low detection limit of 0.6 g. Crucially, by integrating these sensors with eccentric rotating mass (ERM) vibrators via a custom hardware-software architecture, a real-time closed-loop tactile feedback mechanism was constructed. This architecture enables the system to convert the mechanical perception of robotic grasping into differentiated haptic signals for the user. Experimental results demonstrate outstanding system-level performance in both high-precision gesture decoding and responsive tactile feedback, providing a comprehensive solution for next-generation immersive wearable electronics."

The Wiener deconvolution and a self-supervised SelfDeblur network are employed to effectively mitigate PSF-induced effects. To reduce the crosstalk during the deconvolution, an amplitude correction processing is introduced, addressing the problem of insufficient iterations at low-CNR regions. The effectiveness of these deconvolution methods is validated through comprehensive simulations and experimental demonstrations, confirming the capability of enhancing both spatial resolution and wind field retrieval accuracy."

Although the efficiency provisions of chained BFT protocols have been thoroughly analyzed, the leadership democracy has received little attention in prior work. In this paper, we scrutinize the leadership democracy of four representative chained BFT protocols, especially under attack. To this end, we propose a unified framework with two evaluation metrics, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e</i>., chain quality and censorship resilience, and quantitatively analyze chosen protocols through the Markov Decision Process (MDP).

We also discuss future directions toward building more democratic chained BFT protocols."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel complementary self-injection-locked (CSIL) radar architecture for low-power, high-accuracy THz phase sensing. Unlike conventional phase-sensing radars, the CSIL technique does not require frequency synthesis, enabling a compact architecture with low power consumption. It consists of a coupled oscillator pair with envelope detectors for sensing the oscillation amplitude. The oscillator is connected to a novel on-chip hybrid-mode dual-polarized slot antenna for radiation. The CSIL radar employs the self-injection locking (SIL) technique, where a portion of the transmitted signal reflects off the target and is reinjected into the radar. Due to the coupled nature of the system, this self-injection process induces an amplitude imbalance between the oscillators as a function of the target distance. By measuring this amplitude imbalance using the envelope detectors, the system can estimate relative displacements within an unambiguous range of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lambda $</tex-math> </inline-formula>/4. The CSIL architecture is inherently immune to self-interference. It also features an autodyne design, with a single-phase center, allowing easy integration with external optics such as lenses or mirrors. The proposed radar is fabricated using the TSMC 65-nm process. Operating at 232 GHz, it achieves a static range accuracy of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$20~\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m while consuming only 4.6 mW of dc power.

The research employs the Bates Model, the stochastic volatility model with jumps, as the basis for modeling stock price and volatility dynamics. The choice of the Bates Model is motivated by its ability to capture abnormal market events through jumps, and to represent volatility as a stochastic process that reflects actual market conditions. The model provides a solution to a system of stochastic differential equations, which are then simulated to observe the future behavior of stock prices and volatility. Furthermore, the Bates Model allows for the construction of a transition density function that can be used to derive the transition distribution of stock price movements. Based on the analysis results and the derived density transition function, the estimated maximum price drawdown for ANTM stock at the end of the period is IDR 1,616.47, while the estimated maximum price increase is IDR 2,761.87."

Therefore, a method is needed that can overcome these problems by providing more accurate predictions of stock price trends to help investors make investment decisions. One approach that continues to grow in building prediction models is the use of ensemble-learning techniques. The Stacking Ensemble Learner (SEL) is an ensemble learning technique that combines several machine learning algorithms as base models and meta-models to improve prediction performance. This research compares eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and SEL models. The SEL technique uses XGBoost and SVM as base models, and XGBoost as a metamodel that combines the prediction results of the two algorithms. The data used are five independent variables obtained from the calculation of stock prices using technical indicators, namely the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Simple Moving Average (SMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Stochastic Oscillator (SO). The dependent variable in this study is a binary category, namely stock price trends (up and down). The results show that the XGBoost model has an F1-score accuracy value of 96% on the training data, which is higher than that of the SVM model (94%) and the SEL model (95%). This shows that ensemble models do not always guarantee a significantly improved model performance."

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) evaluation is a classic topic in machine learning. Unlike existing methods that assess a DNN's general performance on pre-collected real-world data, we propose an approach to exploring a DNN's local performance on generated data. The core idea is to train a generative model (GM) on real-world data and visualize the DNN's performance over the GM's latent space (GLS). The GLS contains all generated samples (GSs) of the GM, capturing combinations of features and their variations present in the GM's training set, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness of testing. Moreover, the plane organizes all GSs into a continuous space with regular variations in features, enabling users to conduct cross-scale exploration to understand the DNN's behavior across different levels of feature granularity. Our research focuses on two challenges in achieving and applying the idea. First, the GLS is unvisualizable due to its high dimensionality and unboundedness. We thus project the GLS onto a plane and visualize the DNN's performance on this plane. The plane serves as a surrogate for the GLS, providing rich visual cues for locating regions containing GSs involving performance-relevant patterns. Second, the plane alone is insufficient for performance exploration. To overcome this, we develop a system based on it. The system comprises two main views that integrate interactions, such as panning and zooming, to enable users to observe any plane region and assess the DNN's performance on the corresponding GSs. We also develop three auxiliary views to facilitate pattern exploration and to diagnose factors that lead to specific performance patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Estimating the 6-D pose of transparent objects remains a challenging task due to weak visual cues and incomplete depth information caused by refractions and additional reflections from the backsides of transparent objects. These challenges often lead to inaccurate perception and localization. Existing approaches struggle to jointly enhance RGB and depth features or fully exploit depth information. In this article, we propose a depth-directed method that integrates stable diffusion and Mamba-based RGB-D augmentation to address these limitations. Specifically, we use a stable diffusion model to enhance the visibility of transparent objects in RGB images by recovering texture details and reducing background interference. Then, a Mamba-based network completes the sparse and noisy raw depth maps using guidance from the refined RGB features. To effectively fuse the two modalities, we introduce a multiscale RGB-D fusion strategy, where the completed depth not only provides geometric information but also guides RGB feature extraction. This joint representation leads to more accurate and robust 6-D pose estimation. Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object visibility and improves pose estimation accuracy in complex real-world scenes."

    "abstract": "Different from traditional object detectors such as YOLO, Detection Transformers (DETR) have reshaped the landscape of object detection by replacing heuristic-driven components like Non-Maximal Suppression with a fully end-to-end framework based on one-to-one Hungarian matching. While the majority of research has focused on improving the slow training convergence of DETR, this work investigates their security from an adversarial perspective. We unveil a critical vulnerability stemming directly from DETR’s core design: the deterministic one-to-one mapping between object queries and ground-truth objects can be exploited. This allows an adversary to craft perturbations that selectively manipulate specific target objects – causing them to vanish or be misclassified – while preserving the detection integrity of all other objects in the scene. Our initial analysis reveals that conventional gradient-based attacks are ill-suited for this task, as they induce unintended interference on non-target instances, a phenomenon we term as the “spillover effect”. To overcome this, we re-formulate the attack optimization by incorporating a novel penalty term that explicitly decouples the adversarial influence on target and non-target objects. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to derive perturbation bounds under which the optimal matching assignments remain invariant, offering deeper insights into the model’s stability. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed attack significantly improves the success rate and convergence speed while inducing far fewer feature-level artifacts, making the attack both more effective and stealthier."

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) techniques enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, supporting large-scale earth observation. While single-image SR methods improve low-resolution (LR) inputs, they often ignore valuable information from auxiliary data. Reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) leverages historical high-resolution (HR) images to guide the reconstruction of current LR observations, but existing methods struggle with cross-sensor resolution gaps and land cover changes, leading to under-generation or over-reliance on the reference. We propose CRefDiff, a controllable reference-guided diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff leverages a powerful generative prior to produce accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference, we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively fuse both local and global information from the reference image. The model also supports adjustable reference strength during inference for enhanced flexibility. In addition, a Better Start strategy significantly accelerates inference by reducing denoising steps. We further construct Real-RefRSSRD, a real-world RefSR dataset with HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs exhibiting diverse land cover and temporal variations. Experiments demonstrate that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Efficient and reliable data collection is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted low-power wireless networks. However, existing works on UAV-assisted data collection seldom consider how to ensure reliable communication. Experimental studies have shown that changes in UAV's flight direction and potential interference in surrounding environments will impact the range of reliable communication. In light of this, this paper formulates the packet reception ratio (PRR) under harsh environments with interference, by considering the impact of UAV movement on low-power links and factors affecting the relationship between physical layer parameters and PRR. Then, a three-dimensional (3D) spatial partition model for UAV assisted low-power wireless networks is proposed. Experimental results show that compared with existing models, the proposed one reduces the PRR estimation error by up to 77.58%. The proposed spatial partition model accurately distinguishes the connected region, transitional region, and disconnected region, with an accuracy rate exceeding 95% under different flight modes. To verify the practicality of the proposed spatial partition model, its application for UAV-assisted data collection is evaluated through simulations. The results show that compared with existing models, the proposed one can effectively improve the efficiency of data collection."

    "abstract": "The integration of small-sized renewable power plants at the consumer side of a distribution system so-called distributed generation (DG) has emerged as the most sought strategic goal worldwide. Paradoxically, this technology is a prime contributor of a broad spectrum of operational hazards such as reverse power flow, protection concerns and unintended islanding. This paper proposes a passive islanding detection mechanism for the first time in a huge 104 Bus distribution system of Satellite Town region of Bahawalpur, Pakistan using frequency sensitive relays employed in power flow simulation. The rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) method is adopted for islanding detection owing to its ease of implementation, low cost, fast response and better accuracy. The system is upgraded by installing DGs of solar panels at subsequent locations with relays at the intermediate positions. In response to purposeful scenarios of (i) normal DG operation, (ii) grid tripping, (iii) fault occurrence and (iv) load variations, the isolating behavior of relays and circuit breakers is examined as a result of the islanding action. It is concluded that the normalDG operation outperforms the existing network (no DGs) as given by the comparative results of voltage profile, power factor, losses, reliability indices and all normally loaded components. The average transformer and line losses reduce from 5.46 kW and 3.36 kW to 4.38 kW and 2.42 kW and average voltage and power factors improve from 318 V and 0.68 to 352 V and 0.89 respectively. Furthermore, the decision of islanding detection mechanism across each DG panel is executed in a robust way as observed by all frequency sensitive coils being activated only during grid tripping and fault occurrence cases. The islanding detection times are recorded as 100 msec, 49 msec and 32 msec for frequency derivative thresholds of 10 μHz/sec, 5 μHz/sec and 3 μHz/sec respectively with 100% accuracy in each case."

    "abstract": "When it comes to the marriage of graph neural networks (GNNs) and model extraction attacks, the deployment of GNNs within Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) through a publicly pay-per-query API has opened up new attack surfaces. Existing defenses either sacrifice prediction accuracy or fail to thwart more advanced attacks. We investigate this dilemma and discover that fortified models with complex and narrow decision regions are difficult to be reproduced. Nevertheless, complex and narrow decision boundaries are prone to violate the subspaces of neighbor classes under the intrinsic coupling property of graph structure. Furthermore, class-wise representative features within the interior of class-wise subspaces endow the attackers with the capability of functionality replication. Here, we propose a novel model extraction defense, dubbed Decision Boundary-aware Counterfactual Learning (DBCL). DBCL proactively launches counterattacks on potential model extraction attacks, from the very beginning of sensitivity measurement that implicitly detect the malicious queries, such that class-wise representative features embodied in the highly sensitive query batch trigger the demand of worsening their query results unconsciously. Moreover, DBCL draws inspiration from counterfactual learning, aiming at finding the decision boundary-aware adversarial topology perturbations for ambiguously classified query samples, i.e., hard samples, to cross the decision boundary exactly, which introduces the tractive behaviour w.r.t. the inter-connected sensitive samples for class-wise ambiguous topology features. From the graph-structured actionable insights, DBCL innovatively finds the minimum perturbation sufficient for counterfactual learning, without jeopardizing the victim model’s predictive capacity by including confidently classified query samples, i.e., easy samples including sensitive and non-sensitive samples, into their correct classes. Empirically, DBCL shows its effectiveness in reducing the extraction accuracy of the SOTA model extraction attempt with different GNN backbone encoders in evaluating node classification performance. Moreover, we show that DBCL is robust to adaptive model extraction attacks."

    "abstract": "Currently, there is a great demand for compact anechoic chambers for the purpose of saving construction space and cost. To reduce environmental scattering, anechoic chambers should be equipped with electromagnetic absorbers. Traditional pyramidal absorbers are widely adopted in anechoic chambers for antenna testing. However, the performance of the pyramidal absorbers with compact size is poor in the low-frequency region, making them inappropriate for use in compact anechoic chambers for cellular frequency bands. Meanwhile, the reflection of electromagnetic absorbers made of frequency selective surfaces (FSS) can achieve only around −10 dB over a wide frequency band, which is insufficient for antenna testing. In this work, a novel hybrid absorber design framework is reported, which aims to achieve compact absorber design while meeting the demanding requirements of supporting broad bandwidth in the cellular frequency bands and oblique incident angles. The basic idea is to combine the pyramidal absorber with the designed FSS, forming a hybrid absorber with good performance over a broad frequency band. Two types of FSSs operating in the low-frequency region are designed, and then combined with the pyramidal absorber with 10 cm height to achieve good performance over 1 − 7 GHz, outperforming state-of-the-art designs for this specific frequency band. The hybrid absorber design framework is validated through both numerical simulations and experimental measurements."

This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks."

Traditional diagnostic approaches often depend on clinical expertise and can be both labor intensive and time consuming. Deep learning has shown great promise in skin cancer classification, but its effectiveness is often limited by the small size of annotated medical datasets and the domain gap between natural images used in pretraining and dermoscopic images used in clinical practice. This study introduces a deep learning based framework that employs the ResNet50V2 convolutional neural network architecture, optimized through fine-tuning, to automate the classification of skin cancer images. By adjusting the deeper layers of the model, fine-tuning allows the extraction of more relevant features specific to the classification task. The proposed model was trained and tested on the ISIC 2019 dataset, which includes balanced samples of benign and malignant lesions. The fine-tuned network demonstrated superior performance with a classification accuracy of 94.25%, surpassing the baseline model's accuracy of 90.15 %. These results highlight the critical role of fine-tuning in enhancing deep neural network performance for medical image analysis, particularly in the context of skin cancer detection."

    "abstract": "The computational workload of data centers (DCs) exhibits spatio-temporal flexibility, which significantly affects the power consumption and heat dissipation of servers, and water consumption of cooling systems. Thus, DCs can be considered as controllable electrical loads, water loads and heat producers, with the potential to participate in demand response (DR) of the water-energy nexus system (WENS). To fully explore the latent benefits, this work examines the required techniques for modelling and dispatching. Firstly, a combined air-conditioner and water-cooling system (CAWCS) is designed, regulating server room temperature via air-conditioners while utilizing water cooling to extract heat from servers. The constructed CAWCS captures the electricity-heat-water-computation interdependencies, enabling DCs to act as prosumers in WENS. Moreover, an integrated operational framework of DC-WENS is presented, incorporating a coordinated hierarchical dispatch scheme considering data privacy. Following the scheme, the water-energy requirements are initially derived from the optimal heat, power and water flow (OHPWF) model, and then are used as optimization objectives of the decision-making during workload scheduling in DCs. Especially, a deviation correction based convergence algorithm is proposed to ensure the feasibility of the hierarchical scheme. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the benefits of DCs participating in DR of WENS in terms of promoting the accommodation of renewables, reducing economic cost, and improving energy efficiency."

    "abstract": "Visual geo-localization without GPS prior remains a significant challenge for UAV navigation. Traditional retrievalbased methods suffer from scale and rotation variances between UAV images and satellite maps, and their inference speed degrades with increasing map size. To address these challenges, we propose NGC-GeoLoc, a novel geo-coordinate regression framework designed specifically for UAV localization using satellite maps only. Our core idea is to replace retrieval by directly regressing map-space coordinates for every query pixel. Technically, our pipeline combines a visual encoder with regression head, trained with dense supervision generated from multi-scale, multi-rotation satellite crops. During inference, our method efficiently recovers the UAV pose by solving a homography using predicted dense correspondences and refining with dense feature matching. This regression-based framework enables UAV localization that is robust to rotation and scale variations with sub-second inference time, regardless of map size. In experiments on UAV-VisLoc across seven different scenes, NGC-GeoLoc surpasses the baseline in recall on seven scenes and achieves lower inference time across the board.

Nevertheless, how to reconfigure/optimize the real-time controllable coefficients to achieve a favorable end-to-end wireless channel remains a substantial challenge, as it usually requires accurate modeling of the complex interaction between the reconfigurable devices and the electromagnetic waves, as well as knowledge of implicit channel propagation parameters. In this paper, we introduce a derivative-free optimization (a.k.a., zeroth-order (ZO) optimization) technique to directly optimize reconfigurable coefficients to shape the wireless end-to-end channel, without the need of channel modeling and estimation of the environmental propagation parameters. We present the fundamental principles of ZO optimization and discuss its potential advantages in wireless channel reconfiguration. Two case studies for RIS and movable antenna enabled systems are provided to show the superiority of ZO-based methods as compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we outline promising future research directions and offer concluding insights on derivative-free optimization for reconfigurable antenna technologies."

The antenna array is composed of a TE80 mode waveguide converter and eight ALTSA elements. The TE80 mode converter operates as a compact feeding network, which eliminates the complicated multi-level T-junction to realize a 1-to-8 power divider. Besides, a modified operational principle is proposed to analyze the multimode feeding ALTSA array, which enhances the impedance matching and front-to-back ratio (FTBR) while simultaneously reducing the cross-polarization level (XPL). Moreover, metallic split ring resonators (MSRRs) are integrated to realize a roll-off enhanced response. The proposed methodology is validated through an SLM fabricated prototype, which shows a bandwidth of 22.26 – 29.04 GHz and a peak gain of 17.8 dBi, with boresight XPL lower than -25 dB. The average in-band efficiency is about 94%. The FTBRs at E- and H- planes are over 28 dB and 18 dB, respectively. The maximum out-of-band suppression is 38 dB, exhibiting a good response. Due to the flexible array scalability with compact footprint and enhanced performance, the proposed roll-off enhanced ALTSA array can be a promising candidate for various mm-Wave application scenarios."

While current methods mainly focus on learning modality-invariant features through unified embedding spaces, they often focus solely on the common discriminative semantics across modalities while disregarding the critical role of modality-specific identity-aware knowledge in discriminative feature learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features. Finally, an Identity Clues Guided (ICG) Loss is proposed to alleviate the modality discrepancies within the enhanced features and promote the learning of a diverse representation space. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets clearly show that our proposed ICRE outperforms existing SOTA methods."

Despite progress in policy development, most institutions lack structured methodologies to identify and remove these barriers iteratively. This study proposes an Inclusive Agile Scrum Model that integrates inclusion criteria, Personal Learning Environment (PLE) principles, and Scrum’s adaptive structure to support systematic, user-centered resource design in higher education. The model was applied at the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes through a case involving the adaptation of educational materials for a student with hearing impairment. Scrum roles, events, and artifacts were reconfigured to incorporate accessibility-oriented tasks, continuous feedback loops, and transparent communication channels. A pre–post evaluation demonstrated measurable improvements in accessibility, interaction, task completion, and adaptation time. To contextualize institutional needs, a comparative analysis of Mexican universities was also conducted, revealing that although most institutions provide basic infrastructure, few have formal inclusion policies, and none employ agile methodologies to guide inclusion processes. Findings show that the proposed model effectively supports the detection, prioritization, and resolution of accessibility issues while enabling rapid, iterative adaptations aligned with students’ needs. This work advances existing knowledge by moving beyond isolated uses of agile methods in education and generic inclusion models toward a conceptually grounded, replicable, and empirically validated inclusive Scrum framework. The study positions agile methodologies as a promising pathway to strengthen accessibility practices and foster more equitable learning environments in higher education."

It is crucial to plan and synergize the operation of renewable, hydrogen, electrical, and thermal energy production, storage and utilization systems in order to minimize energy supply costs. This paper presents a coordinated long term (yearly operation scheduling) and short term (day-ahead and intra-day scheduling) optimization based operation approach for a hydrogen-enabled zero-carbon energy system (HZES) that incorporates renewable energy sources, multi-energy conversion devices, and long and short term energy storage. An integrated end-to-end prediction-optimization (IPO) method is developed to train the PV generation prediction model, which combines upstream renewable energy output predictions with downstream energy system operation optimization. This approach reduces operation decision gaps caused by renewable energy output prediction errors during training to enhance renewable energy utilization. The actual results are obtained from the HZES in production operation and the energy supply costs are compared with four other practical energy systems. It is shown that the HZES outperforms the current power grid and the city heating utility significantly in terms of the total annualized capital and operating cost by 37% to 49%. Furthermore, compared to the current rule-based operation process, the new optimization based method achieves more than 40% operational cost savings."

By discussing similarities and differences between DCCB and LCS, the working principle of LCS and system requirements for LCS are revealed. Then, an LCS based on MCCB (MCCB-LCS) is proposed, with its structure, operating methods, and parameter design methods also demonstrated. Simulation and experiments are carried out to validate the proposed MCCB-LCS. The load current through the line to be disconnected is transferred to other lines within 20ms in simulations, and load current exceeding 2kA is interrupted within 20ms in experiments.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive stability droop control method that considers battery states for DC shipboard microgrids (DC SMGs), aiming to enhance DC bus voltage stability and ensure healthy battery operation. First, a full-order model incorporating battery dynamics is developed for the DC SMG system. A novel battery state-dependent stability strength index is then proposed to quantitatively assess the impact of battery states on the system's large-signal stability. Furthermore, by integrating this stability strength index into the droop coefficient design, an adaptive stability droop control method based on battery states is introduced. In contrast to conventional droop control methods that use fixed droop coefficients, the proposed approach utilizes feedback from battery states and stability margins to ensure healthy battery operation while improving DC bus voltage stability under load fluctuations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation-based studies."

The recent availability of large-scale digital collections of figurative artworks creates opportunities for computational analysis, but existing methods mostly focus on classification or style detection, lacking structured modeling of high-level figurative elements and integration of cultural context. We present <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DAVA</i>, a visual analytics system that supports interdisciplinary exploration of figurative art.

Second, we employ a vision–language model to discover latent patterns from these features and present them through novel visualization designs. Third, we introduce domain-informed AI agents that simulate interdisciplinary research teams to interpret artworks in cultural and historical context. To evaluate <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DAVA</i>, we first conducted a quantitative evaluation demonstrating the accuracy and consistency of the multi-agent interpretation mechanism.

    "abstract": "Intraoperative anomalies cause deviations from the ideal surgical workflow, heightening the risk of consequential errors and complications. Their reliable recognition has traditionally relied on continuous surgeon monitoring, yet automated anomaly detection systems are now indispensable for the safe advancement of assistive and autonomous surgery. However, existing approaches struggle with domain shifts across surgical platforms and unpredictable scenarios in deformable surgical environments. To address this, we propose DA-MIST, a Domain Adaptive Multiple Instance Self-Training framework for weakly supervised anomaly detection. DA-MIST adopts a two-stage training strategy that combines multiple instance learning with self-training, enhanced by a scene-decoupled memory mechanism that disentangles state-irrelevant scene variations from memory banks, preserving only state-discriminative features for robust anomaly identification. Additionally, a state-aware dual-branch attention module integrates Gaussian dynamic and global self-attention for effective temporal reasoning. Evaluated on our newly compiled large-scale endoscopic video dataset encompassing seven representative anomalies, DA-MIST demonstrates strong adaptability across heterogeneous surgical domains, consistently reducing false alarms and enhancing anomaly localization accuracy. Our code and dataset will be available at: https://github.com/iamziang/DA-MIST."

    "abstract": "The sidelobe suppression performance of existing iterative adaptive filtering methods severely deteriorates in the presence of range-Doppler-straddling targets. To resolve this issue, a straddling-robust iterative adaptive filtering (SR-IAF) algorithm is proposed. It incorporates the range-Doppler-straddling and intra-pulse Doppler effects into the received signal model, and compensates the straddling mismatch iteratively using the estimated straddling offsets. To further improve the capability of SR-IAF for sidelobe suppression in scenarios including range-spread targets, a modified SR-IAF (MSR-IAF) algorithm is then proposed. In this algorithm, the coarse positions, the lengths, and the number of range-spread targets are first determined according to the SRIAF outputs; then the straddling offsets of range-spread targets are refined based on the minimum error criterion; finally, SR-IAF is again performed with the estimated range-Doppler image and straddling offsets as prior knowledge to further subdue sidelobe levels of range-spread targets effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed SR-IAF method is capable of recovering the range-Doppler images with well suppressed sidelobes for point straddling targets, resulting in successful detection of weak targets located near strong targets. Compared with SR-IAF, MSR-IAF can further improve the performance of sidelobe suppression for rangespread targets with straddling, as demonstrated by the simulated and the experimental results."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) based feature extraction to improve pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images. The motivation behind this approach is to leverage the complementary strengths of both learned and handcrafted features. While CNNs are highly effective at capturing hierarchical spatial patterns, such as textures and anatomical structures, HOG features are particularly useful for emphasizing edge, shape, and contour information that may not always be fully captured by deep networks alone. Using a dataset consisting of 5,876 chest X-ray images categorized into pneumonia and normal classes, the proposed CNN+HOG hybrid model demonstrates strong performance. The model achieved an accuracy of 95.98% and an F1-score of 95.98%, reflecting its reliability in handling class imbalance and ensuring consistent predictions. When compared with a baseline CNN model and several state of the art architectures including ResNet and DenseNet the hybrid model consistently outperformed them across multiple evaluation metrics. These results suggest that combining handcrafted features with deep representations can significantly enhance diagnostic performance. The proposed hybrid approach offers a more robust and interpretable tool for pneumonia classification, making it a promising technique for supporting clinical decision-making in medical imaging."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by blood entering the media layer of the aortic vessel wall. This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of varying levels of buyer-supplier collaboration on supply chain (SC) performance under simultaneous demand and supply uncertainty. While collaboration is widely acknowledged as a lever for improving SC performance, prior analytical studies have predominantly focused on coordination mechanisms or contract structures. A gap persists in the literature regarding the quantified comparison of decentralized, partially collaborative, and fully collaborative policies-particularly under epistemic uncertainty, where limited data constrain the applicability of traditional probabilistic models. To address this gap, we develop an analytical model to evaluate three collaboration policies: (i) decentralized, (ii) joint economic lot-sizing (JELS), and (iii) vendor-managed inventory (VMI). The model integrates both demand- and supply-side uncertainty using general probability distributions. To capture epistemic uncertainty-common in pandemics, infrastructure disruptions, and other high-impact events-we adopt the PERT-Beta distribution, which is designed for expert-driven planning in data-scarce contexts. We derive closed-form expressions for expected SC surplus and identify conditions under which increasing collaboration improves system-wide performance. A surplus-sharing mechanism is introduced to equitably allocate collaborative gains across dyadic partners. Numerical simulations based on a healthcare case involving personal protective equipment (PPE) illustrate the theoretical findings and provide additional insights into the relative performance of the decentralized, JELS, and VMI policies under different parameter regimes and operating conditions. This study offers a tractable, generalizable model for analyzing SC collaboration under uncertainty and provides actionable insights for firms and policymakers seeking to strengthen SC performance, equity, and service levels during disruptions."

The understud ied ACMG system comprises multiple voltage source inverters (VSIs), where the proposed adaptive mechanism is utilized to dynamically tune the controllers' gain in real-time. This adaptive synchronization layer improves the performance of the control system in transient conditions, such as abrupt load f luctuations, plug-and-play (PnP) operations and maintains the robust operation in the presence of measurement noise and communication disturbances, all without imposing a significant additional computational burden. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured through a Lyapunov-based analysis, ensuring bounded tracking error and robustness to parameter uncertainties. The simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink show that the proposed decentralized secondary control achieves a 75% improvement in response time to rapid reference changes, reducing it from 2 seconds with centralized secondary control to 0.5 seconds, while also improving voltage tracking performance. It also significantly reduces frequency deviations during PnP events (∼10×), representing a substantial improvement compared to conventional fixed-gain secondary controllers commonly used in networked ACMGs."

In this paper, we introduce TextBridge, a text-centered framework that uses the text modality as a semantic anchor to guide cross-modal integration and alignment. TextBridge employs frozen encoders from state-of-the-art pre-trained models and introduces an innovative modality bridge module that enhances semantic alignment and reduces redundancy among different modal features. The framework also incorporates a multi-projection text feature fusion method, enhancing the alignment and integration of text features from diverse modalities into a cohesive semantic representation. To optimize the integration of multimodal information, we make the text encoder trainable and use a text-centered contrastive loss function to enhance the model's ability to capture complementary information across modalities. Extensive experiments on the M5Product dataset demonstrate that TextBridge significantly outperforms the SCALE model in mean average precision (mAP) and precision (Prec), underscoring its effectiveness in multimodal retrieval tasks."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is still a serious global health concern, especially for older people and children. A lack of radiologists and the subjectivity of manually interpreting chest X-ray (CXR) pictures frequently make it difficult to provide an accurate and timely diagnosis. Automating medical picture categorization tasks has shown great promise because to recent developments in deep learning, especially the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In order to categorize pediatric CXR images into normal and pneumonia groups, this study compares a number of pre-trained CNN models, such as EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and VGG16. With an accuracy rate of 93.86 percent, VGG16 outperformed the other baseline models. To further improve this result, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) was integrated into the classification head of the VGG16 model. The enhanced VGG16-CBAM model outperformed all other configurations, reaching an accuracy of 95.59 percent, along with high values for precision, recall, and F1-score. These results indicate that the attention mechanism successfully strengthens the model's focus on spatial and channel-wise features, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy. The findings highlight the potential of combining pre-trained models with lightweight attention modules for more reliable and interpretable AI-assisted pneumonia diagnosis."

Although existing single-task remote sensing image restoration methods are effective, they lack generalizability across tasks. All-in-one methods can handle multiple degradation tasks, but they usually focus on spatial information, ignoring the physical properties of the degradation information. To address the above limitations, we propose a Multiscale Spatial-Frequency Degradation Decoupling framework for All-in-One remote sensing image restoration (SFD <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula> IR), which decouples degradation features across different tasks to guide the model in performing task-specific image restoration. Specifically, a task-specific instruction generator (TIG) is proposed first to transform degradation features into task-specific prompts. Then, a multi-scale multi-frequency enhancement (MME) module is designed to decouple degradation effects from both spatial and frequency perspectives, thus enhancing the model's adaptability to various degradation types. Finally, a prompt feature refinement (PFR) module is developed to further refine the model's response to degraded tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on different RSIR tasks, including cloud removal, deblurring, dehazing, and super-resolution.

    "abstract": "The integration of satellite and autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) communications has become essential for the scenarios requiring both wide coverage and rapid deployment, particularly in remote or disaster-stricken areas where the terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. Furthermore, emerging applications increasingly demand simultaneous mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) capabilities within the same aerial network. However, jointly optimizing these operations in heterogeneous satellite-AAV systems presents significant challenges due to limited on-board resources and competing demands under dynamic channel conditions. In this work, we investigate a satellite-AAV-enabled joint MEC-DC system where these platforms collaborate to serve ground devices (GDs). Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the average MEC end-to-end delay and AAV energy consumption while maximizing the collected data. Since the formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a Q-weighted variational policy optimization-based joint AAV movement control, GD association, offloading decision, and bandwidth allocation (QAGOB) approach. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem as an action space-transformed Markov decision process to adapt the variable action dimensions and hybrid action space. Subsequently, QAGOB leverages the multi-modal generation capacities of diffusion models to optimize policies and can achieve better sample efficiency while controlling the diffusion costs during training. Simulation results show that QAGOB outperforms five other benchmarks, including traditional DRL and diffusion-based DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the MEC-DC joint optimization achieves significant advantages when compared to the separate optimization of MEC and DC."

Existing models primarily address either consensus formation or binary polarization, failing to account for the diverse, multi-polar opinion distributions observed in real-world social interactions. This work introduces a dynamic opinion model integrating individual stubbornness and opinion sensitivity, enabling the simulation of multi-opinion coexistence within social networks. It is formally proven that, under low-impact events, opinions converge to a neutral consensus under both synchronous and asynchronous updates. For high-impact events, where theoretical analysis is challenging, this work employs simulations under asynchronous updating, which better reflect real conditions. The results indicate that mixed groups may exhibit multi-state coexistence, with homogenized social relationships leading to weak opinion cohesion and social heterogeneity fostering community formation. To regulate diverse opinions in social networks, this work introduces two governance strategies designed for events with different impacts. Notably, for events with limited impact, soft opinion guidance shapes group preferences more effectively than forceful interventions. These findings offer insights for refining policy communication strategies and advancing the broader understanding of opinion dynamics in diverse societies."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of labeled data is a critical challenge in industrial process multi-scale modeling, as learning reliable models from limited labeled data and large-scale unlabeled data is crucial for fault diagnosis tasks. To solve the issue effectively, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised multi-scale graph neural network (SsMsGNN) based on the framework of graph convolution autoencoder networks (GCAN). The SsMsGNN mainly comprises a multiple scale graph structure learning module, a multi-scale feature extraction network, and a multi-scale feature fusion network. The multi-scale feature extraction network captures multi-scale inherent features from raw data through different pathways. Here, two variant multi-scale feature extraction network architectures are presented for GCAN, i.e. the multi-scale pyramid feature (MsPyF) and the multi-scale parallel feature (MsPaF) networks, each employing two optimization strategies (frozen and cross) to improve model performance. Meanwhile, the multiple scale graph structure learning module generates scale-specific adjacency matrices to represent topological relationships between process variables. Finally, the multi-scale feature fusion network aggregates representations from multiple layers to establish the fault classification network. Moreover, the semi-supervised learning mechanism of the GCAN can effectively leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for the proposed SsMsGNNs. Case studies on the Tennessee Eastman and the Three-Phase Flow processes demonstrate that the proposed SsMsGNNs outperform existing methods, showing significant improvements in fault diagnosis performance, especially when incorporating numerous unlabeled data. Codes of the proposed models are available at https://github.com/seajq/SsMsGNN."

    "abstract": "High-frequency input signals from room-temperature microwave sources present a major bottleneck for scaling qubit numbers in universal quantum computers. To address this challenge, we previously developed a superconducting single-flux quantum (SFQ) qubit control circuit (SQCC) capable of generating precise SFQ pulse sequences using only DC bias. This approach eliminates traditional microwave signal chains and enables scalable, low-loss DC-based interconnects. However, as the number of SQCCs increases, the total required bias current grows linearly, leading to significant cable-induced thermal dissipation that limits scalability. In this work, we propose and implement an architecture using recycled bias current to scale up multiple SQCCs (RB-MSQCC). Theoretical analysis indicates that the recycling method can reduce thermal load by a factor of 100 to 1000 compared to conventional biasing. A key enabler of this architecture is a custom-designed driver-receiver pair (DRP) cell, which supports SFQ signal transmission across isolated ground planes using the SIMIT Nb03 process. Based on this, we demonstrate a 4-bit RB-MSQCC prototype. Experimental results confirm stable SFQ pulse generation across all four channels, with output frequencies ranging from 3.42 to 5.27 GHz, consistent with prior results (2.40-8.11 GHz). These findings validate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed scheme under current fabrication constraints. Our study offers both theoretical and experimental support for scalable, energy-efficient SFQ-based qubit control, representing a critical step toward large-scale superconducting quantum processors."

    "abstract": "Transformers are established in natural language processing (NLP). Their capabilities improve with model size, but training and hosting larger models are computationally demanding. Quantization of model parameters can reduce cost; however, it generally leads to a significant loss in model performance. We introduce BitTransGNN which improves the performance of transformers quantized to low-bit precision by integrating their architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) during training. BitTransGNN substantially reduces and often closes the performance gap between quantized transformers and their full-precision counterparts while retaining the computational efficiency advantages provided by quantization, including lower memory and energy costs. This is possible since transformers and GNNs capture different characteristics of data. Transformers excel in modeling contextual semantics. GNNs excel in modeling very long-range relationships extracted from the entirety of texts beyond the reach of transformers' contextual window sizes. Alongside the transductive joint model, we introduce inductive variants of BitTransGNN, which transfer the knowledge of the joint framework into a standalone quantized transformer. BitTransGNN outperforms quantized transformer baselines trained without GNN integration with minimal additional overhead, and shows competitive performance against full-precision baselines across multiple language benchmarks. Its inductive variants also successfully encapsulate the information captured by the joint model into a standalone quantized transformer, achieving consistent performance gains over quantized baselines with zero additional inference cost. Furthermore, by combining advanced post-training quantization methods with BitTransGNN, we show that its improvements are complementary to those attainable through advancements in quantization."

The experiments trained and tested MobileNet and MobileNetV2 models using small datasets of 50, 75, and 84 images. The workflow included JetPack installation, Docker configuration, model training, and analysis of accuracy and confusion matrices to reveal both performance improvements and hardware constraints. The results show that MobileNetV2 consistently achieves higher detection accuracy than MobileNet and benefits significantly from incremental increases in training data, even when the data is limited. However, training time grows non-linearly—from less than 40 minutes with 50 images to nearly nine hours with 84 images. Further experiments were unsuccessful due to the 2 GB memory limit and the heavy reliance on swap memory. Additionally, the limitations of JetPack 4.6.1 hinder virtualization and cross-architecture comparisons. These findings confirm that the Jetson Nano 2GB is well-suited for lightweight inference and small-scale model training; however, it is not recommended for larger datasets without careful workload optimization, improved thermal management, and the adoption of more efficient neural network architectures."

    "abstract": "Harnessing the full potential of capsule robots requires highly precise and reliable pose estimation. This paper presents a dynamic bounding box optimization strategy based on Gaussian similarity for accurately estimating the pose of capsule robots in ultrasound images. Specifically, a robot-adaptive label assignment strategy is developed to effectively extract features through learning the geometric properties of capsule robots. Subsequently, a novel bounding box representation is presented to accommodate variations in position and orientation. Additionally, a predicted boxes similarity metric, based on the elliptical Gaussian distributions, is proposed to achieve optimal bounding box similarity beyond the conventional IoU metric. This metric not only mitigates the limitations of IoU in non-overlapping cases but also provides a more refined basis for network optimization. Finally, a dynamic and adaptive optimization strategy is introduced to enhance estimation accuracy. A localization error of 0.11 mm and an angle error of 1.00° were achieved by the proposed model, demonstrating superior estimation accuracy. To evaluate the model’s generalizability, a private dataset reflecting real-world clinical scenarios more closely was constructed. Without any fine-tuning, the model trained solely on the public dataset yielded a localization error of 0.39 mm and an angle estimation error of 2.60° on the private dataset, confirming the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "Wearable haptic gloves have the potential to greatly enhance active touch experiences in virtual reality (VR). However, it remains unclear how well people can interpret glove-enabled virtual touch experiences when experienced passively (for example, when they passively view a virtual hand perform autonomous actions while also feeling what the virtual hand feels via a haptic glove). Such a “haptic replay” scenario could enable people to share, revisit, or demonstrate touch-critical experiences, including medical palpation or fine manipulation of tools. This study explores a virtual user's ability to interpret one tactile feature, object size, when receiving touch feedback from a commercial haptic glove during either an active or passive grasp interaction. Although passive conditions resulted in poorer size acuity than during active touch, passive performance improved when participants mimicked the motion of the virtual hand, underscoring the role of proprioceptive feedback in grasp interpretation. Additionally, gender differences in performance suggest potential influences of glove ergonomics and size congruency between the real and virtual hand. Future research should investigate these variables and strive for balanced gender representation to assess generalization across VR applications."

This method integrates task-based measures with self-perceived ability ratings and open-ended critique, applied directly to the visualizations being read. Grounded in learning sciences frameworks that view understanding as a multifaceted process, MdamV spans six dimensions: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Comprehending</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Decoding</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Aestheticizing</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Critiquing</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Reading</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Contextualizing</i>. Validation was supported by a survey (N=438) representative of Austria's population (ages18-74, male/female split), using a line chart and a bar chart on climate data. Findings show, for example, that about a quarter of respondents indicate deficits in comprehending simple data units, roughly one in five people felt unfamiliar with each chart type, and self-assessed numeracy was significantly related to data reading performance (p=0.0004). Overall, the evaluation of MdamV demonstrates the value of assessing visualization understanding beyond performance, framing it as a situated process tied to particular visualizations."

    "abstract": "The complex patterns of passenger travel in metropolitan rail systems pose substantial challenges for daily operations. To allocate revenues and optimize train schedules, operators require accurate data on passenger flows and path choices. We propose a data-driven method for path choice estimation that captures time-dependent segmented travel information in public transport systems. The method combines mobile signals, automatic fare collection (AFC), and train operation data to infer passenger travel behaviors within the metro system. Aspatiotemporal metro hypernetwork models passenger travel and train operations along feasible paths. The proposed travel-chain reconstruction method estimates segmented travel time distributions for each station across multiple time periods. A nonlinear programming optimization model calibrates path choice probabilities by minimizing discrepancies between theoretical and observed origin-destination (OD) journey time distributions. Case studies using both synthetic and real world data validate the model’s performance for the Nanjing metro system, China. Synthetic data validation shows the proposed model achieves approximately 85%-90% prediction accuracy for OD paths with ascending transfers, and remains robust to changes in path travel times. Real data results show that the TIDE-PCE model accurately estimates true path fractions and observed exit demand, with superior performance during peak hours."

The electric and thermoelectric properties revealed a power factor of 100.91 μW/mK² for In₂O₃ and 2.08 μW/mK² for Cu. Here, In₂O₃ benefits from its high Seebeck coefficient, while Cu contributes to superior electrical conductivity, making their combination promising for thermoelectric sensor applications. In addition, a two-leg thin-film thermocouple was developed, and its performance was explored. Also, the origin of the highest sensitivity (~115 μV/K) in this kind of hybrid thermocouple using band-theory diagrams was discussed. Further, we obtained an output power of 0.38 nW with an optimal current of 0.23 μA at ΔT of 35 K, making it suitable for low-power electronic IoT applications, such as self-powered sensors and energy-harvesting devices. The temperature measurements of ice-filled beaker and human body temperature show high sensitivity, excellent stability, long-term reliability, and superior performance of the thermocouple and make it a promising candidate for real-time and fast temperature-sensing applications."

We consider a downlink scenario where one base station serves multiple users over several subchannels. The number of available subchannels is less than the number of users, and thus, some users have to share a subchannel via NOMA. Our goal is to maximize the system energy efficiency subject to the users' rate requirements and the overall transmit power budget. We propose a deep learning-based approach termed NOMA-Net (NOMANet) to solve the considered problem. Particularly, NOMANet adopts a GNN-based architecture that maps channel state information (CSI) to the desired power allocation scheme for all subchannels. NOMANet adopts multi-head attention and residual/dense connections to enhance feature extraction. To guarantee the feasibility of NOMANet's output, we employ a customized activation function and a penalty method. Numerical results show that NOMANet trained in an unsupervised manner achieves performance close to that of the successive convex approximation (SCA) method but with an inference speed approximately 700 times faster. Besides, NOMANet exhibits scalability to both the number of users and subchannels."

By leveraging advanced simulations, the study highlights the central functions of selected urban design elements, such as building orientation, site planning, and integration of greenery, in thermal comfort, usability, and environmental quality within highdensity tropical contexts. The results show that specific urban interventions can effectively reduce heat stress, the effect of heat islands in cities, and the associated increase in temperature. The precision of environmental forecasting for wind flow, pollutant dispersal, and thermal comfort can be improved with the use of advanced simulation technologies and machine learning.

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) have been developing rapidly in recent years. However, the charging speed of existing EVs has encountered a bottleneck, which has become a major constraint on their further development. Superconducting cables offer significant advantages, including high current-carrying capacity and low losses, demonstrating great potential for enhancing EV charging performance. In this paper, we design a superconducting charging plug - a specialized connector for EVs - based on a flexible superconducting cable, aiming to achieve faster charging. Through a combination of mechanical simulation and experimental validation on custom-fabricated single- and doublelayer cable samples, the critical twisting angle was evaluated. The results show that the proposed cable design exhibits superior torsional performance, with a critical twisting angle per meter that is 49.68% higher than that of conventional copper-core CORC cables. This work provides key insights for the structural optimization of high-performance superconducting charging systems."

    "abstract": "We present a fully open-source, air-driven bidirectional, rotational MRI phantom. It enables an accurate and reproducible evaluation of displacement artefacts for any MRI sequence and velocity field and acceleration sensitivity for phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) sequences. Its unique feature of analytically defined motion is expected to narrow the gap between simulations and experiments for in-silico and in-vitro experiments using the very same sequence code. Methods: A rotational phantom was bidirectionally driven (clockwise (CW) / counterclockwise (CCW)) by an actively controlled airflow. The rotating cylinder filled with a Polyvinylpyrrolidone-water mixture was monitored via an external laser-based tachometer system. Vendor-supplied and custom open-source PC-MRI sequences were evaluated on a 3T MRI system and used as input for Bloch simulations. Resulting magnitude and velocity images were evaluated against the phantom's ground truth data. Results: For physiological angular velocities, displacement errors resulted in a 10% radial stretch while apparent acceleration sensitivity is 5% of v<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">enc</sub>. The time difference between velocity and spatial encoding time points of 1.9ms determining the severity of the artefacts could be quantified without prior knowledge of details about the MR sequence. Simulation and experiment yielded excellent agreement. Conclusion: The phantom enables an easy, precise and repeatable evaluation of motion sensitivity of MR sequences and may offer a future reference measurement. Additional timing parameters of MR sequences may be reported in future literature to improve comparability. The seamless MRI sequence definition for in-silico and in-vitro experiments narrows a significant gap in MR research. Significance: This work establishes a reproducible, standardized validation framework for PC-MRI techniques that can be readily implemented across institutions, facilitating quality assurance procedures and supporting the development of more accurate flow quantification methods in clinical applications."

However, findings are typically restricted to a consolidated textual form based on notes from interviews or observations. A challenge arises from integrating different sources of observations, leading to large amounts and heterogeneity of collected data. To address this challenge we propose a practical, modular, and adaptable framework of workshop setup, multimodal data acquisition, AI-based artifact extraction, and visual analysis. Our interactive visual analysis system, reCAPit, allows the flexible combination of different modalities, including video, audio, notes, or gaze, to analyze and communicate important workshop findings. A multimodal streamgraph displays activity and attention in the working area, temporally aligned topic cards summarize participants' discussions, and drill-down techniques allow inspecting raw data of included sources. As part of our research, we conducted six workshops across different themes ranging from social science research on urban planning to a design study on band-practice visualization. The latter two are examined in detail and described as case studies. Further, we present considerations for planning workshops and challenges that we derive from our own experience and the interviews we conducted with workshop experts. Our research extends existing methodology of collaborative design workshops by promoting data-rich acquisition of multimodal observations, combined AI-based extraction and interactive visual analysis, and transparent dissemination of results."

    "abstract": "Coded caching shows great potential for reducing delivery latency in satellite networks by exploiting multicast opportunities among users with different requests and leveraging predictable mobility. Unlike previous studies focusing on direct satellite-user connections with uniform cache sizes, we investigate a more practical scenario where satellites serve users through arbitrarily distributed terrestrial relays, with users connected to different relays having heterogeneous cache sizes. To address this, two basic schemes are introduced to develop a hybrid decentralized hierarchical coded caching scheme, which integrates zero-padding, pipelined-forwarding, and concurrent transmissions across layers. By balancing these two basic schemes, an upper bound of the global transmission delay is derived. Additionally, a new converse bound is established by decoupling satellite-relay/user connections, classifying users by cache sizes, constructing cyclic wrap-around request patterns and deriving the cut-set bound for selected users. Furthermore, a more tractable lower bound is derived by introducing a selection threshold that effectively captures user density and cache heterogeneities, identifying performance-limiting head users. Theoretical analysis shows that the transmission delay is within a constant factor of the lower bound, which constitutes a constant-gap result for hierarchical and satellite-terrestrial networks with heterogeneous user caches. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Scrap steel detection is vital for optimizing recycling and manufacturing, but deploying machine learning models in distributed industrial settings faces challenges from data privacy and bandwidth constraints. Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across dispersed clients without sharing raw data, preserving privacy. However, feature drift and bidirectional knowledge forgetting, driven by diverse imaging conditions and non-independent identically distributed data, remain critical bottlenecks that conventional FL cannot effectively address. This article proposes FedCLAM, a novel FL framework that explicitly tackles these challenges through three key innovations: 1) feature decoupling to separate shared and personalized representations and mitigate coupling bias; 2) feature-driven adaptive aggregation to alleviate parameter aggregation bias and enhance global robustness; and 3) knowledge inheritance to preserve both global and local knowledge across communication rounds, effectively reducing forgetting. Extensive experiments on real-world and open scrap steel datasets demonstrate that FedCLAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL baselines, achieving superior classification accuracy, stability, and generalization in heterogeneous and noisy industrial scenarios."

    "abstract": "Digital watermarking technology has become an important means to protect the copyright of digital media. However, existing methods often fail to simultaneously meet the key requirements of high real-time performance, high invisibility, strong robustness, and enhanced security. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient digital watermark embedding and extraction method based on an invertible matrix fusion domain, which establishes a balanced trade-off among these competing objectives. This method, for the first time, derives the properties of invertible matrix multiplication in the spatial domain and embeds the watermark by directly calculating the high-energy coefficients and evenly distributing the changes, thereby simplifying the embedding process and improving computational efficiency. To address the error propagation problem in quaternary coding, a minimum error propagation strategy based on quaternary (MEPQ) is proposed to enhance the robustness. In addition, the watermark image is encrypted by using the four-dimensional Lorenz chaotic system, which expands the key space and resists statistical attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method: it achieves excellent invisibility (PSNR <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt 40$</tex-math></inline-formula> <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$dB$</tex-math></inline-formula>, SSIM <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt 0.98$</tex-math></inline-formula>), strong robustness against various attacks (average NC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt 0.98$</tex-math></inline-formula>), high real-time efficiency (embedding time 0.18 seconds, extraction time 0.06 seconds, with <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(n)$</tex-math></inline-formula> complexity), and enhanced security with a large key space (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2^{768}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) to resist statistical attack and brute-force attack.

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has shown remarkable robustness in high-mobility scenarios by effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of Doppler shifts. However, accurate channel estimation for OTFS systems remains a challenging problem due to issues such as energy dispersion caused by fractional Doppler shifts, limited exploitation of inherent delay-Doppler domain sparsity, and prohibitive computational complexity. In this work, we propose a novel decoupled channel estimation framework that decomposes the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel into separate delay and Doppler components. This decoupling facilitates a more efficient and targeted utilization of channel structures in each domain. Building upon this framework, we develop a novel estimation algorithm based on decoupled Bayesian learning (DC-BL), which leverages virtual grids and integration-based sensing matrices to achieve super-resolution channel recovery. Notably, the proposed method retains adaptability even under low-resolution grid settings. To address such scenarios, we further design a specialized Bayesian estimation algorithm optimized for coarse-granularity grids. Both algorithms incorporate a sparsity-aware mechanism to eliminate redundant channel taps, thereby significantly reducing model dimensionality and computational burden. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and efficiency."

Through finite element analysis (FEA), the electromagnetic performance of both conventional and split-tooth PM arc motors is evaluated, leading to the development of the STPMAM-DE topology. The operating principle and torque generation mechanism are analyzed, with particular attention to the magnetization configuration of the PMs to enhance the fundamental magnetomotive force and suppress the 3rd harmonic, thereby improving torque output. Comparative FEA results demonstrate that the STPMAM-DE offers higher torque density and improved overload capability up to 150% of the rated torque compared with the benchmark designs. Experimental validation via a prototype confirms the enhanced torque performance and operational efficiency of the motor, supporting the feasibility and advantages of the proposed dual-excitation structure."

    "abstract": "Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of X-ray tubes is critical for ensuring the reliable operation and imaging stability of computed tomography equipment. However, the diverse degradation patterns and significant signal fluctuations in X-ray tubes obscure degradation characteristics, making RUL prediction particularly challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes a RUL prediction framework for X-ray tubes based on degradation pattern clustering and multi-domain feature fusion. First, early-stage filament current modulation and clustering are employed to identify degradation patterns, mitigating domain distribution discrepancies. Second, considering periodic fluctuations and inherent noise in X-ray tube degradation, filament signals are decomposed into trend, periodic, and residual components to extract multi-scale time-frequency features. Third, a multi-head attention mechanism is employed for deep time-frequency feature fusion, facilitating recursive RUL prediction. Finally, the proposed method is validated using realworld operational data from millions of scans collected via an internet of medical things platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing models in terms of RMSE, achieving values as low as 0.019. This highlights marked improvements in prediction precision, especially near end-of-life conditions."

Recent research highlights the role of soil moisture (SM) as a predisposing factor to large fires, yet critical thresholds remain poorly characterized across different data sources. Volumetric SM measurements differ in magnitude and dynamic range across large spatial extents and satellite products, making direct comparisons challenging. To address this, we calculated the Fraction of Available Water (FAW), which ranges from 0 to 1 as SM varies from wilting point to field capacity. Using satellite observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Global Change Observation Mission for Water, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and the climate change initiative (CCI) programs, we explored antecedent conditions in south-central Chile that favored an extreme fire spread in early February 2023, when over 240 000 ha burned in just four days. Our analysis showed that FAW was low—not only in the days immediately before the fires, but throughout the preceding month. Critical thresholds emerged across multiple satellite products, revealing plant stress (FAW < 0.50) and extreme drought (FAW < 0.20). Even drier conditions (FAW < 0.10) were widespread, affecting both burned and nonburned areas and reducing moisture constraints across the region. Our findings demonstrate that FAW thresholds derived from multiple satellite products, including SMOS, SMAP, and CCI, provide a robust framework for identifying SM levels that may predispose areas to wildfire danger."

Specifically, the composite constraints primarily consist of state constraints and terminal time constraints. For the former, state-mapping functions and universal barrier functions are introduced to address asymmetric dynamic delayed constraints, which are further enhanced through state transformation to create new state variables. This approach eliminates the limitations imposed by initial system conditions and the influence of unknown terms, while accommodating both unconstrained and constrained scenarios. The latter introduces terminal time constraints on the basis of the former framework to rapidly satisfy system performance requirements. Furthermore, neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate the reconstructed multiple fault information and system uncertainties. Then, an actor-critic-identifier architecture based on fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL) is constructed via an optimal backstepping (OB) method, enabling the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation within each subsystem without the need for persistent excitation. Finally, by integrating Lyapunov stability theory with graph theory, it is proven that all signals are bounded, and the followers ultimately achieve dynamic consensus with the leader. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this control strategy."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) and the increasing reliance of smartphones on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) have made improving positioning accuracy in complex urban environments a critical challenge. Although GNSS itself is limited by signal blockage and multipath effects in urban canyons, integrating fifth-generation (5G) technology offers significant potential to enhance positioning performance. Therefore, we propose a smartphone-based BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS)/5G hybrid positioning solution, which combines the time of arrival (ToA) and angle of arrival (AoA) measurements from 5G field tests to improve positioning accuracy. We first start from the Fisher information matrices (FIM) to theoretically prove the gains of 5G to BDS positioning. Additionally, we introduce a carrier-phase-based 5G ToA ranging method that achieves a precision of about 10 cm in static conditions. The results from experiments on two different smartphones demonstrate that the hybrid positioning system consistently outperforms standalone BDS SPP. In the open-sky static scenario, horizontal accuracy improved by 5-22% and vertical accuracy by 29-32%. In the heavily obstructed Static-3 scenario, horizontal accuracy improved by approximately 14% for both devices, while vertical accuracy improved by over 17%. This robust performance was confirmed in the dynamic test, where the 3D RMS error improved by 40.8% for the K50 and 32.4% for the P40. And 5G AoA contributes to BDS positioning improvements more stably than ToA, even though ToA can achieve centimeter-level accuracy. The findings suggest that the BDS/5G hybrid positioning method can effectively mitigate the limitations of satellite-based positioning for smartphones in obstructed environments."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) en ables a unified framework for high-capacity communications and accurate sensing, where trajectory optimization plays a crucial role in jointly enhancing communication quality and sensing performance. This paper explores trajectory planning for ISAC systems, aiming to minimize the completion time for a radio target (RT) to traverse between designated starting and ending points, while fulfilling a communication task with a minimum data transmission requirement. We introduce the concept of path exposure to characterize path sensitivity by capturing the cumulative sensing intensity along a trajectory. Furthermore, path capacity is proposed to measure the end-to end throughput of a given path. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as the minimization of completion time while maintaining path sensitivity and path capacity requirements. By leveraging the Lagrangian approach, the problem is converted into a framework with calculus of variations and solved using the Euler–Lagrange equation. The boundary value problem (BVP) methodology is then employed to compute the optimal trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed continuous trajectory planning approach compared to discrete methods and highlight the inherent trade-off between trajectory length and the quality-of-service requirements in both sensing and communication domains."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) users’ behaviors are influenced by users’ willingness, which is not directly observable. Emerging large language models (LLMs) have advantages in handling this problem. However, existing studies usually use LLM to directly output EV users’ behaviors, which is limited by the LLM’s inherent issues: “randomness” and “hallucination”. To address these issues, this study proposes an LLM-Bayesian network (BN) integrated simulation framework. First, LLM is used to extract and label EV users’ willingness. Second, LLM generates an explicit causal structure and prior probability, which constructs a BN. Finally, Bayesian inference updates the BN’s prior probability. The BN outputs EV users’ charging behaviors. Experimental results show that in few-shot scenarios, LLM-BN achieves a 20.3% to 27.5% improvement in predictive accuracy compared to pure LLM methods. Moreover, LLM-BN addresses “randomness” and “hallucination” issues, and effectively suppresses violations of physical constraints and the generation of fake information. In practical applications, peak shaving and valley filling are achieved through electricity price adjustments, reducing peak demand by 25% and increasing off-peak demand by 30%."

    "abstract": "Vision foundation models in remote sensing have been extensively studied due to their superior generalization on various downstream tasks. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, providing significant advantages for Earth observation. However, establishing a foundation model for SAR image interpretation inevitably encounters the challenges of insufficient information utilization and poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a remote sensing foundation model based on complex-valued SAR data, which simulates the polarimetric decomposition process for pre-training, i.e., characterizing pixel scattering intensity as a weighted combination of scattering bases and scattering coefficients, thereby endowing the foundation model with physical interpretability. Specifically, we construct a series of scattering queries, each representing an independent and meaningful scattering basis, which interact with SAR features in the scattering query decoder and output the corresponding scattering coefficient. To guide the pre-training process, polarimetric decomposition loss and power self-supervised loss are constructed. The former aligns the predicted coefficients with Yamaguchi coefficients, while the latter reconstructs power from the predicted coefficients and compares it to the input image’s power. The performance of our foundation model is validated on nine typical downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Notably, the foundation model can extract stable feature representations and exhibits strong generalization, even in data-scarce conditions."

    "abstract": "For dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous machines (DT-PMSMs) under open-phase fault (OPF), the remaining healthy phase currents are optimized to achieve fault tolerant control (FTC), and the optimal currents are often unbalanced to ensure control performance. In existing FTCs, once optimal currents are designed, the phase with the largest magnitude is fixed and remains the largest under most conditions. Hence, this phase is always under high loss and thermal stress, which is prone to fault and limits the maximum torque capability. This article presents a phase current magnitude (PCM) adaptive FTC for DT-PMSMs, in which PCM can be adaptively controlled to avoid overheating of phase winding and improve maximum torque capability. Moreover, maximum torque per loss (MTPL) strategy is developed to minimize the total copper loss for a given torque. The FTC with adaptive PCM model is first derived, based on which the MTPL FTC is formulated and computation-efficient optimal solution is derived. Moreover, the control rule is designed to adaptively adjust the PCM, which can ensure the machine to safely delivers a large torque and improves torque capability. The proposed approach is validated on a test machine under various operating conditions."

Existing modalities—such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and surface electromyography (EMG)—lack muscle specificity and are prone to stimulation artifacts. To address these limitations, we fabricated and applied a Wearable Ultrasound Sensing (WUS) system, featuring dual flexible 64- element transducer arrays with center frequency of 6 MHz conformed over the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles for simultaneous antagonist muscle monitoring. A machine learning (ML) pipeline was introduced to estimate tissue displacement (TD) from raw ultrasound signals. Across three participants and multiple trials, the WUS system achieved tremor frequency detection within 10 %variation relative to commercial B-mode and IMU sensors, and met statistical equivalence thresholds based on two one-sided test (TOST) analysis. The TD estimation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with overall Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and actual values ranging from 0.88 to 0.97, normalized RMSE values below 10 %, and offline model building times under 800 seconds. Compared to classical B-mode speckle tracking, the proposed WUS-ML pipeline reduced offline model building time by 75 % (from 3095 sec to 792 sec). In real-time performance tests, it reduced frame-level latency from 3700 ms to 17 ms and achieved effective processing rates exceeding 50 Hz, well above the Nyquist threshold for tremor analysis. These results demonstrate the feasibility of dual-array wearable ultrasound for accurate, low-latency tremor tracking and lay the groundwork for future closed-loop afferent stimulation systems in both clinical and at-home environments."

    "abstract": "In biological systems, organisms undergo continuous, intertwined processes of evolution and learning, embedding intelligence in morphology that supports robust and adaptive behaviors in complex environments. Inspired by this principle, evolutionary robotics explores the co-evolution of body and control, transferring part of the computational burden from the controller to the physical body. However, the co-evolution paradigm faces two key challenges. The vast, high-dimensional morphological space that dilutes selective pressure, leading to suboptimal morphologies, and the high computational cost of lifetime-fitness evaluation, which slows evolutionary feedback. Here, we introduce Directed Morphological Evolution (DME), which integrates plasticity-inspired morphology-environment adaptation feedback with a Shapley-guided mutation matrix. Upon detecting maladaptation, DME promptly terminates the current evolutionary lineage and then directs the search toward higher-contribution mutations based on their relative contributions. In this way, DME narrows the exploration to the most promising regions of the search space, eliminating wasteful evaluations. At the same time, DME provides interpretable evolutionary trajectories, where each morphological mutation is guided by a quantified contribution and triggered by environmental maladaptation or prolonged performance stagnation. In simulation experiments across four increasingly complex terrains, DME consistently outperforms baseline methods, approximately doubling final fitness and halving search time. Furthermore, the contribution analysis shows that a small subset of key mutation operators accounts for roughly 85% of cumulative contributions, validating DME’s ability to identify and exploit the key mutation operations, and revealing that different environmental conditions lead to divergent evolutionary trajectories."

    "abstract": "Data centers rely on Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) to achieve lossless data transmission in Ethernet networks. To avoid buffer overflow, PFC pauses flows in a coarse-grained manner, which brings potential problems, e.g., Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking, and PFC deadlock. Although the state-of-the-art approach BFC with per-flow backpressure tackles some of the limitations of PFC, it faces implementation challenges due to the need for a large number of queues. In this paper, we present F-PFC, a fine-grained flow control scheme that only leverages a small amount of queues to address the limitations of PFC. Specifically, F-PFC first designs a fine-grained flow backpressure scheme to adjust the intensity of flow control adaptively. With different levels of flow backpressure, F-PFC ensures high throughput and low latency simultaneously. Then, F-PFC presents an accurate flow identification scheme to locate flows that really contribute to congestion. Finally, F-PFC presents a dynamic queue assignment and scheduling scheme to isolate congestion flows with limited queues. We theoretically analyze the performance of F-PFC and present the implementation of F-PFC. Extensive testbed experiments and large-scale simulations verify the performance of F-PFC. The experimental results show that F-PFC reduces tail latency by at least 33% and queue occupancy by 46% compared with state-of-the-art approaches."

Challenges such as variations in tumor shape, size, and class imbalance often reduce model effectiveness. This study optimizes the EfficientNetB5 architecture through hyperparameter tuning to improve classification accuracy and reliability. Four hyperparameter optimization methods, including Bayesian Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Random Search, and Grid Search, were applied to tune parameters, including dropout rate, dense units, learning rate, L2 regularization, and batch size. The dataset consists of 3264 MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. Preprocessing involved image resizing and data augmentation to address class imbalance. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics. Experimental results show that Random Search achieved the highest overall performance, with an accuracy of 95.54%, macro precision of 95.75%, macro recall of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 5. 0 0 \\%}$</tex>, and macro F1-score of 95.33%. Grid Search followed closely, while Bayesian Optimization and PSO showed relatively lower performance. These findings suggest that combining EfficientNetB5 with systematic hyperparameter optimization can improve brain tumor classification performance based on our experimental results."

    "abstract": "Transition loss in cosmetic manufacturing refers to hidden inefficiencies that occur between production activities, such as idle time, repeated steps, or uneven durations, which often go unnoticed by traditional monitoring systems. Although subtle, these delays can gradually reduce overall efficiency and output. This study introduces a hybrid approach combining process mining and statistical process control (SPC) to detect, quantify, and analyze such inefficiencies using real production event logs from PT XYZ. Process mining enables the discovery of actual work sequences, uncovering deviations such as self-loops, unauthorized activities, and uneven transitions, while SPC provides a statistical assessment of variation and stability in recurring tasks. The analysis revealed more than 408 hours of undocumented idle time, frequent repeated machine cleaning, and unstable performance in critical preparation stages, particularly in the liquid and tube production lines, affecting transitions for 50 ml and 100 ml product sizes. These findings represent approximately 12 % of total recorded production hours, highlighting significant opportunities for efficiency gains. Unlike conventional monitoring methods, the proposed hybrid approach provides novel insights into root causes of transition loss, such as operator-induced loops and shift-based variations, which are rarely visible in standard reports. The results offer practical input for workflow refinement, targeted improvement initiatives, and smarter monitoring strategies to enhance productivity in cosmetic manufacturing."

The analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) capable of such rates are too expensive for consumer electronics. A low-cost alternative is offered by the equivalent-time sampling receivers (ETSRs), of which those employing programmable delay chips (PDCs) provide the fastest measurements. The off-the-shelf PDCs offer delays as small as 10 ps, which, in principle, allow for sampling rates up to 100 GSa/s. In reality, the temporal digitization precision is compromised by the PDC temperature-dependent delay inaccuracies (as large as up to 520ps), precluding accurate time sampling at or above 20 GSa/s. We quantify the temperature dependence of the PDC delays in situ, i.e., the chip is installed in the ETSR time-sampling circuitry, where a sensor provides its real-time temperature. We propose a calibration method, which improves the radar’s timing accuracy by two orders of magnitude to ~5 ps. Statistical error analysis and UWB pulse measurements with a 5-GHz analog bandwidth PDC-based UWB radar demonstrate the method’s effectiveness."

However, existing HIF detection methods show low accuracy and reliability, and protection remains a great challenge in active distribution networks. In this article, a novel HIF detection method is proposed by considering nonlinear arc distortion features in active distribution networks. First, according to the dynamic processes of arc quenching and restriking, the changing characteristics of arc current are analyzed theoretically. Then, based on the theoretical analysis of arc distortion features, two distortion indicators are defined. The first is the arc time-periodic indicator, and the second is the nonlinear distortion ratio. Finally, a HIF detection criterion is developed by combining the two distortion indicators. 150 sets of simulation and experimental results validate the reliability and applicability of the proposed detection method. Across all tested scenarios, the proposed method achieves a detection rate exceeding 98% and maintains a false alarm rate below 2%. In addition, the proposed method can accurately differentiate between HIFs and normal transient disturbance events such as load switching, capacitor switching, and transformer inrush current, ensuring the security of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Deep multi-view clustering (MVC) has gained widespread attention as it can effectively mine consistent information from multiple views and improve clustering performance. However, view bias often exists between views (i.e., the quality differences between views). Treating all views equally inevitably destroys structural information when simply concatenating or summing the embedded representation of multiple views. To alleviate this issue, we propose a deep multi-view clustering with intra-view similarity and cross-view correlation learning (MISCC), facilitating the intra-view discriminability and inter-view complementarity. Specifically, we utilize the intra-view inherent structure information to dynamically identify semantically similar samples within each view. By aggregating their embedding representations, fine-grained structures are enhanced to boost intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separation. Then, we construct a cross-view correlation learning module to align semantically related views while preserving the distinctive features of irrelevant views. Based on them, a centralized clustering alignment strategy is proposed to align the similarity distribution and clustering structure between each view and the unified view, balancing the diverse information among multiple views. By jointly training these modules, the unified representation is optimized to capture more discriminative information from multiple views. Extensive experiments conducted on eleven multi-view datasets demonstrate that MISCC outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering methods."

    "abstract": "Reliable detection of surrounding objects is critical for the safe operation of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). However, inherent limitations such as the restricted perception range and occlusion effects compromise the reliability of singlevehicle perception systems in complex traffic environments. Collaborative perception has emerged as a promising approach by fusing sensor data from surrounding CAVs with diverse viewpoints, thereby improving environmental awareness. Although collaborative perception holds great promise, its performance is bottlenecked by wireless communication constraints, as unreliable and bandwidth-limited channels hinder the transmission of sensor data necessary for real-time perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes SComCP, a novel taskoriented semantic communication framework for collaborative perception. Specifically, SComCP integrates an importance-aware feature selection network that selects and transmits semantic features most relevant to the perception task, significantly reducing communication overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we design a semantic codec network based on a joint source and channel coding (JSCC) architecture, which enables bidirectional transformation between semantic features and noise-tolerant channel symbols, thereby ensuring stable perception under adverse wireless conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In particular, compared to existing approaches, SComCP can maintain superior perception performance across various channel conditions, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. In addition, SComCP exhibits strong generalization capability, enabling the framework to maintain high performance across diverse channel conditions, even when trained with a specific channel model."

However, their inherently dynamic and distributed nature introduces complexities, making them susceptible to anomalies. Machine learning (ML) approaches are crucial for identifying patterns that signal potential anomalies in cloud-native architectures. This article reviews ML-based anomaly detection approaches for cloud-native architecture, proposing a taxonomy and focusing on ML techniques, anomaly types, data characteristics, and evaluation aspects. We identify six key requirements for effective anomaly detection in cloud-native architectures and analyze the reviewed approaches against these criteria. Through this analysis, we provide insights into the state of the field and uncover research gaps. Our findings reveal that existing approaches often fail to meet adaptability, distributed operation, and interpretability requirements in cloud-native architectures. Future research should focus on developing anomaly detection methods that adapt seamlessly to dynamic cloud-native architectures and provide interpretable knowledge to improve operational reliability."

First, direct error compensation with finite tracking bandwidth is used in the position loop, complex disturbances induced by dynamic lag are counteracted. In addition, to address transient error spikes from velocity reversals and target lifting, a nonlinear saturation constraint-based compensation method is introduced in the velocity loop. Essentially, a saturation function is incorporated into the servo control law to reshape the amplitude of velocity errors and directly compensate for them, thereby enabling accurate trajectory tracking error regulation. Furthermore, to elucidate the saturation performance of the proposed compensator and the relationship between the filter bandwidth and system stability, the influence of the saturation function threshold is analyzed, following which the selection rules of parameters are also provided. Simulation and experimental results on a moving platform demonstrate that the NDEC scheme can be easily implemented and exhibits excellent performance in trajectory tracking and high-frequency disturbance rejection."

To solve these issues, this article proposes a robust LMC method for three-level inverter-fed LIM drive system under low switching frequency of linear metro. First, a hybrid optimal primary flux search method is proposed to select the optimal flux reference, where the loss model and the gradient descent method are combined for system loss minimization and robustness enhancement. Second, an ultralocal model-based predictive flux control with two-step prediction optimization is developed to flexibly manipulate optimal flux under low switching frequency. By observing the lumped disturbance, the reference voltage vector (VV) independent of parameters can be obtained for optimal VV determination. Moreover, after incorporating with the magnetizing inductance identification-based flux observer, the parameter robustness of the core parts in existing LMC methods, i.e., flux observation, optimal flux selection and manipulation, has been significantly enhanced. Finally, comprehensive simulation and experiment have been conducted, showing that compared to the existing LMC method, the system loss is further reduced by 1.9% and 5.3% under accurate parameters and mismatched parameters, respectively."

Although deep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance in interference detection and characterization, most models remain too computationally expensive for onboard deployment due to high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose LiteJam, a lightweight architecture that utilizes pre-correlation in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) data to construct pseudo-image representations without requiring additional hardware. Specifically, LiteJam adopts a multi-scale convolutional architecture to capture interference patterns, employs a dynamic sparse attention mechanism to adaptively emphasize spatio-spectral cues, and leverages a hierarchical multi-head module for interference detection and characterization. Experimental results show that LiteJam outperforms all baselines. The F1-score of interference classification is 95.74%, outperforming lightweight baselines by 4.37%–24.51%, and generalizes well across diverse scenarios, while maintaining high computational efficiency for real-time UAV applications.

This study proposes a data-driven classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm, optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for effective feature selection. A total of 11 attributes were extracted from public online listings via web scraping, covering room amenities, public facilities, and accessibility measures, with rental price as the target variable. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and duplicates and discretized into categorical form to comply with Naive Bayes assumptions. PSO was employed to select the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality and enhancing classification performance. It was chosen for its simplicity, fast convergence, and proven effectiveness in various recent applications, including engineering, geoscience, energy optimization, and intelligent systems. The PSO-optimized Naive Bayes model outperformed the baseline Naive Bayes, which achieved 82.81 percent accuracy, by reaching an average accuracy of 85.19 percent using tenfold cross-validation. In addition, precision, recall, and F1-score improved to 82.89 percent, 85.18 percent, and 83.28 percent, respectively. Key features consistently selected by PSO included air conditioner, fan, and water dispenser, indicating their strong influence in distinguishing economy, standard, and premium categories. These results demonstrate that integrating PSO with Naive Bayes not only improves predictive performance but also enhances interpretability, providing a reliable framework for intelligent recommendation systems in student housing management."

    "abstract": "Index modulation (IM) has been proposed and widely demonstrated to improve the spectral efficiency by simultaneously utilizing both the indices of activated subcarriers and their modulated symbols for data transmission in bandwidth-limited visible light communication (VLC) systems. However, current studies assume uniform activation probabilities for all subcarriers without adapting subcarrier index selection to channel conditions, thus limiting system performance maximization. In this paper, we for the first time propose and investigate a novel orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with non-uniform index modulation (OFDM-NUIM) scheme for VLC systems. In OFDM-NUIM, subcarrier interleaving is first introduced to redistribute adjacent subcarriers in the frequency domain into distinct subblocks. This ensures each subblock contains subcarriers with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Subsequently, non-uniform index modulation is proposed to dynamically adjust subcarrier activation probabilities based on the SNR distribution within interleaved subblocks. This strategy preferentially activates subcarriers with higher SNRs for data transmission, thereby concentrating the active subcarriers in the low-frequency region. Consequently, it mitigates the high-frequency fading effect inherent in VLC systems and further enhances its anti-interference capability and transmission reliability. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed OFDM-NUIM scheme are experimentally demonstrated. The results indicate that the proposed OFDM-NUIM scheme can effectively improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of VLC systems."

Here, we specifically investigate these relationships concerning the body structure, input parameters, and observed states using classical swinging body dynamical systems: soft tentacles and a simulated multilink pendulum. Principally, we show that the mechanical structure (including stiffness and damping) couples with input parameters (frequency and magnitude) to regulate the manifested computational capabilities, and the type of PRC (if any) that can be achieved. Further, we show that input rate drives a transition between linear memory-based and nonlinear calculations, while the mechanical structure alters the conversion between longer and shorter memories. By investigating sensory limitations, we show that a spatiotemporal structure of the computational properties exists that relates to the mechanical structure, and that can be exploited to improve selected computing tasks in soft tentacle PRCs. Using the parameter dependencies we additionally provide inferences into the computational archetypes of the bodies of established soft robots."

To avoid overcurrents and overvoltages in a control task on component level, a safeguard is presented, which is capable of dealing with arbitrary loads without the need of a priori knowledge during the training process of the reinforcement learning-based controller. The control plant is a three-phase, four wire, three-level 250 kVA capable inverter with an LC-filter. After 6 minutes of training, an reinforcement learning controller achieves a normalized mean absolute error (w.r.t. the reference voltage amplitude) in a voltage control task of 0.33% in steady state. During a transient loadstep of 1 kA within 1 ms, corresponding to a current change of 200% of the rated current, the reinforcement learning controller is capable of safely and stably tracking the setpoint. In a comparison to various model-based, expert-driven controllers, in particular a cascaded PI controller, a predictive dead-beat controller and a combination of both, the reinforcement learning controller shows comparable or better results, both in steady state as well as in transient behavior and enables a highly automated controller design toolchain with minimal human effort, without prior system knowledge and without simulative pre-training."

We utilize visual information from movie posters to visually ground the movie keywords, thereby acquiring more semantically precise text representations, resulting in a substantial 14.5% enhancement in box-office prediction accuracy. Also, we develop metrics to quantify content similarity based on the keywords, facilitating the identification of “copycat movies,” a term that can be extended beyond traditional sequels and franchise movies. Subsequently, we analyze the importance of copycat features in box-office revenue prediction using two explanatory methods: Attention Rollout and LIME. Our analyses show the importance of copycat features in box-office prediction and reveal a positive relationship between copycat movies and box-office revenues. However, this effect diminishes with an increase in the number of similar movies and the similarity of their content. Overall, our work establishes a comprehensive process of predicting movie box-office revenue by utilizing multi-modal data and providing valuable business insights."

To go beyond the conventional commercially available superconducting (SC) magnets, very large infrastructures such as the ones gathered within the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) are necessary. The SuperEMFL project is a design study aiming at providing the European high field user community with much higher superconducting fields. This is meant to be achieved by combining high temperature superconductor (HTS) insert magnets, an emerging technology that can work in fields above 25T, with low temperature superconductor (LTS) outsert magnets, a technology limited to fields below 25 T. The project has two design magnetic field targets, 32+T and 40+T. The first design target proposed to combined a single stack of HTS pancakes in combination with a 19 T / 150 mm LTS magnet; the second either a similar arrangement at the sake of a narrower central space or a design with two nested HTS coils combined with a 15 T/ 250 mm LTS magnet. The particular choice of the project is to use no insulation but a metallic tape co-wound with the bare HTS tape. This so-called Metal as Insulation (MI) technology enables a self-protection feature of the HTS coil by allowing the electrical bypass of defects as well as better mechanical performances in a very compact winding. The use of HTS inserts introduces a change of paradigm by providing an unprecedented combination of high magnetic field and long measurement times whilst saving vast amounts of energy in operation."

Although LFM detection offers high scale-factor stability through frequency-based angular-rate encoding, residual bias errors often emerge even under zero angular rate. Experimental measurements reveal the presence of a second-harmonic component in the frequency modulation that cannot be explained by conventional linear cross-axis coupling models. To clarify this behavior, a theoretical model is developed considering the inclination of parallel-plate electrostatic transducers under large-amplitude wineglass-mode vibration. The analysis shows that the electrostatic stiffness becomes quadratically dependent on the vibration amplitude of the orthogonal mode, producing a second-order coupling term proportional to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\cos (2\\theta)$</tex-math></inline-formula>. Experimental results obtained using an FPGA-based dual-axis control system confirm that the amplitude of the second-harmonic component scales with the square of the drive voltage, validating the proposed model. These findings demonstrate that plate-tilt-induced nonlinear coupling is a major source of ZRO fluctuation in LFM gyroscopes."

Consequently, the identification of risky driving behaviors is imperative for ensuring road safety. In order to effectively address the limitations of existing methods in modeling long-term dependencies, integrating external scenario information, and adapting to different driver personalities, this paper proposes a Transformer-based cross-attention feature fusion model for risky driving behavior recognition, referred to as CAFFT. This model utilizes a hierarchical Transformer encoder structure to capture fine-grained changes and long-term dependencies in driving behavior. Furthermore, the cross-attention mechanism, a cross-modal attention mechanism, is introduced to effectively fuse driving behavior features with weather-related external scenario features, thereby rendering the research scenario more aligned with real-world driving conditions. Finally, through cross-validation and cross-test set generalization experiments, the universality and stability of the method are verified. The experimental results on real driving datasets demonstrate that the CAFFT model achieves substantial performance enhancements in recognizing risky driving behavior. This improvement leads to enhanced accuracy and reliability in recognizing risky driving behavior, thereby providing substantial support for the development of intelligent driving assistance systems."

Although the DCM is derived from the linear inverted pendulum model, which admits a closed-form solution, extending it to nonlinear, height-varying pendulum dynamics complicates the derivation and typically requires iterative computation or piecewise linearization, resulting in a high computational cost. This letter introduces an energy-based derivation that enables the derivation of the DCM in closed form, even when the pendulum height varies, allowing for the flexible generation of curved paths that include both convex and concave shapes without requiring piecewise linearization. The proposed method is validated through comparative pendulum simulations and through its application to bipedal walking and a balance-assist motorcycle. The results confirm that the proposed method successfully enables the DCM to be expressed for nonlinear trajectories, allowing a conventional DCM-based stabilizer to be applied directly."

Simply increasing rewards can improve participation but leads to excessive platform costs, highlighting the need for intelligent and cost-efficient task organization mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-stage Reinforcement Learning based Trust-Aware Task Bundling and Allocation (DRL-TTBA) strategy that jointly optimizes task completion rate, data quality, and platform profit. Specifically, task bundling is optimized through a dual-stage deep reinforcement learning framework based on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithms, while task allocation adopts a trust-aware strategy that jointly considers worker willingness and trust. A Bayesian trust model with Gaussian-kernel deviation weighting is further introduced to evaluate unknown workers and progressively identify trusted and high-quality workers, enabling a closed-loop interaction between task execution outcomes and subsequent bundling and allocation decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the DRL-TTBA consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving data quality improvements of 14%~106% while maintaining high task completion rates and improving platform profitability. These results confirm the effectiveness of integrating trust-aware with task bundling for reliable and efficient mobile crowdsourcing."

    "abstract": "In IoT-based water quality monitoring, traditional three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence spectroscopy is difficult to deploy directly on terminal sensors due to its large size, high cost, and complex structure, despite its rich information being highly advantageous for water pollution detection. In this work, a novel approach is proposed through designing a compact sensor integrated with a super-resolution reconstruction algorithm to meet the requirement of entire 3D fluorescence spectra in cloud deployment of monitoring network at minimal cost. In the design of the terminal sensor, multiple LEDs with different wavelengths serve as excitation light source and multiple filters are used to switch emission wavelengths, enabling the acquisition of a sparse 3D fluorescence spectrum. In the reconstruction algorithm, a point spread function (PSF) is employed as a constraint module to simulate the degradation process of spectra from high to low resolution by modeling the spectral characteristics of the optical components responsible for degradation, including LEDs and optical filters, which can enhance the authenticity of the reconstructed spectra. Furthermore, a joint training strategy is introduced for better robustness by jointly optimizing the parameters of PSF and deep learning network. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the highest reconstruction quality (PSNR: 47.57 dB, SSIM: 0.9903) and pollutant identification accuracy (98.1%) compared with seven other reconstruction methods. The proposed approach can obtain high-resolution and entire 3D fluorescence spectra for water pollution detection with low manufacturing cost and minimal data, thereby meeting the practical application requirements in the field of IoT-based water quality monitoring."

To prevent Mamba from being potentially impacted by unordered keypoints that obscured its ability to mine spatial information, we customize a causal sequential learning approach based on the Gumbel-Softmax technique to establish causal dependencies between features in a fully autonomous and differentiable manner. Additionally, a local-context enhancement module is designed to capture critical contextual cues essential for correspondence pruning, complementing the core framework. Extensive experiments on relative pose estimation, visual localization, and analysis demonstrate that CorrMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, in outdoor relative pose estimation, our method surpasses the previous SOTA by 2.58 absolute percentage points in AUC@20°, highlighting its practical superiority. Our code will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation and classification of adipose tissue are critical tasks in the field of medical imaging, as they contribute to enhanced medical diagnostics. However, manual segmentation and classification are time-consuming and prone to variability. These limitations drive the development of automated and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). A wide range of ML and DL techniques now exist, offering diverse strategies for medical image analysis and early disease detection. Given this growing body of work, a systematic literature review is necessary to synthesize evidence, compare methodologies, and identify research gaps. Existing literature reviews on adipose segmentation and classification often focus on specific imaging modalities or limited disease applications. Nevertheless, none provide a systematic quantitative evaluation of ML and DL methods. Such a systematic quantitative evaluation is essential for a fair comparison of methodologies and guiding the development of more robust AI models. Moreover, existing reviews overlook key challenges, including limited annotated datasets, feature extraction, and predictive modeling for disease risk. This systematic literature review investigates ML and DL techniques for adipose tissue segmentation, classification, and disease risk prediction. An extensive search across four major scientific databases is conducted, followed by rigorous selection criteria that yield forty high-quality studies. The selected studies are classified into two types: ML-based segmentation and classification, covering fourteen studies, and DL-based segmentation and classification, covering twenty-six studies. Within the ML-based approaches, further analysis focuses on four major radiomic features, providing deeper insights into feature extraction techniques. In contrast, among the twenty-six DL-based studies, nine specifically address limited annotated data, with a focus on semi-supervised learning strategies and data augmentation methods. The review also presents a critical analysis of dataset constraints as well as the inherent limitations of both ML and DL architectures. To provide a more detailed perspective, ML and DL techniques are further examined across applications in ten different disease types. In addition, the role of adipose tissue biomarkers in disease risk prediction is analyzed. Despite these advancements, the review identifies challenges related to dataset limitations, annotation constraints, feature extraction, model interpretability, prediction reliability in disease risk assessment, and integration into clinical practice. Consequently, future research directions should focus on improving imaging modalities, expanding standardized datasets, advancing DL architectures and hybrid models, enhancing generalization and interpretability, and ensuring seamless clinical workflow integration."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the distributed online learning problem under dual time-varying conditions of the objective functions and network topologies. The goal is to enable agents to track the global minimum of the time-varying objective functions through online collaboration. An online gradient descent algorithm combining a soft update mechanism and projection method is proposed for time-varying unbalanced directed graphs. The projection method ensures that decision variables consistently satisfy constraints after each iteration. In our design, the soft update is a trade-off strategy that balances the relationship between current consensus decisions and new decisions derived from local projected gradients by introducing a step-size parameter. This approach can regulate the convergence rate and stability of the algorithm. Dynamic regret bound related to the minimum path length, step-size, and smoothing parameter is given by an improved regret analysis method. It is shown that the bound is not explicitly related to the time horizon, and thus tighter than the bounds in most prior work. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through a simulation experiment."

    "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa) is a staple food for more than half of the world's population, making its productivity crucial for global food security. However, rice cultivation is vulnerable to diseases such as leaf blast, hispa, and brown spot, which can significantly reduce yields. Traditional disease detection relies on manual visual inspection, often inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to error due to farmers' limited knowledge, leading to delayed diagnosis and substantial crop losses. This study implements a modern deep learning approach for rapid and accurate disease identification to address this challenge. We utilized the YOLOv12 Nano (YOLOv12n) architecture, a state-of-the-art, one-stage object detector known for its computational efficiency and fast inference speed. It is suitable for real-time applications on edge devices. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 1,999 images, comprising three disease classes (Leaf Blast, Hispa, and Brown Spot), collected from field documentation in Bangkalan, Indonesia, and a public Kaggle dataset. The dataset was partitioned into 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. Model performance was evaluated using the mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) metric. The experimental results show that the optimal configuration, achieved with a batch size of 16 and 300 epochs on a non-augmented dataset, yielded a mAP@0.5 of 82,1% with an inference time as low as 0.6 ms per image. These findings demonstrate the high potential of YOLOv12n as an effective and efficient tool for automated disease detection, paving the way for advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture."

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of autonomous navigation for mobile robots in complex environments, many recent path planning methods employ a two-layer motion framework that integrates both global and local planning. However, global planning algorithms based on evolutionary algorithms often yield suboptimal paths, primarily due to premature convergence and wasted iterations in infeasible regions. Meanwhile, local planning algorithms, particularly the dynamic window approach (DWA) and its variants, are frequently tailored to specific scenarios, limiting their generalizability. To address these issues, this paper proposes an effective path planning method, namely M2PP. The global planning algorithm in M2PP enhances particle swarm optimization (PSO) by introducing multiple new search phases, creating a multi-phase PSO that can quickly identify feasible global paths and thoroughly explore the sampling space. To effectively handle multiple scenarios in a more generalized manner, the local planning component, multi-scenario adaptative DWA, integrates two novel terms into its cost function, enhancing both static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that multi-phase PSO exhibits strong performance and robustness, especially in highly complex scenarios, and multi-scenario adaptative DWA can generate safe and efficient local trajectories in hazardous conditions. Additionally, experiments deploying the M2PP method on a real-world mobile robot further confirm its feasibility."

    "abstract": "Recently, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) has been widely utilized in various research domains. This is particularly evident in application fields, where SHAP analysis serves as a crucial tool for identifying biomarkers and assisting in result validation. However, despite its frequent usage, SHAP is often not applied in a manner that maximizes its potential contributions. A review of recent papers employing SHAP reveals that many studies subjectively select a limited number of features as ’important’ and analyze SHAP values by approximately observing plots without assessing statistical significance. Such superficial application may hinder meaningful contributions to the applied fields. To address this, we propose a library package designed to simplify the interpretation of SHAP values. By simply inputting the original data and SHAP values, our library provides: 1) the number of important features to analyze, 2) the pattern of each feature via univariate analysis, and 3) the interaction between features. All information is extracted based on its statistical significance and presented in simple, comprehensible sentences, enabling users of all levels to understand the interpretations. We hope this library fosters a comprehensive understanding of statistically valid SHAP results."

Here, we specifically investigate these relationships concerning the body structure, input parameters, and observed states using classical swinging body dynamical systems: soft tentacles and a simulated multilink pendulum. Principally, we show that the mechanical structure (including stiffness and damping) couples with input parameters (frequency and magnitude) to regulate the manifested computational capabilities, and the type of PRC (if any) that can be achieved. Further, we show that input rate drives a transition between linear memory-based and nonlinear calculations, while the mechanical structure alters the conversion between longer and shorter memories. By investigating sensory limitations, we show that a spatiotemporal structure of the computational properties exists that relates to the mechanical structure, and that can be exploited to improve selected computing tasks in soft tentacle PRCs. Using the parameter dependencies we additionally provide inferences into the computational archetypes of the bodies of established soft robots."

The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer. This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II)."

The visual differences between beef and pork are often difficult to detect with the naked eye, necessitating a technology-based approach to accurately identify meat types. This study aims to implement the ResNet50 architecture to automatically classify images of beef and pork. The dataset used is the Pork, Meat, and Horse Meat Dataset. The model is developed using transfer learning by leveraging the pretrained weights of ResNet50 on ImageNet. ResNet50 is chosen due to its capability in handling very deep networks without performance degradation and its proven effectiveness in various image classification tasks. This research also explores different combinations of hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and dropout rate. The image dataset was divided into 80% training data and 20% testing data, with 20% of the training data used as validation data. Experimental results show that the best performance is achieved with a combination of batch size 8, learning rate 0.0001, and dropout rate 0.2. Evaluation using a confusion matrix demonstrates high performance, with an accuracy of 98%, precision of 100%, recall of 96%, and F1-score of 98%. All evaluation metrics were calculated using pork as the positive class. These results indicate that the ResNet50 model is effective in distinguishing between images of beef and pork, and can be utilized as a tool to objectively verify the halal status of meat products."

The conductive filament with low melting point, i.e., Electrifi, and the dual-extruder fused filament fabrication (FFF) process are here utilized to implement the desired metal-dielectric composite structure with high design freedom. Firstly, for reducing the size of the patch structure, metal blind vias are introduced to provide the extra capacitance. Then, based on the compact patch prototype, two different strategies for generating CP waves are proposed where non-uniform metal and dielectric structures are utilized to support the desired perturbation respectively. The non-uniform metal structure is formed by adjusting the initially introduced blind vias with different depths, while the dielectric one is achieved by bringing in air blocks for the asymmetrical dielectric distribution. Compared with those previously reported 3-D printed patch antennas, the proposed one fully utilizes the design freedom offered by 3-D printing. The side length of the proposed 3-D printed CP patch antenna is less than 0.4 λ0, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength of the center operating frequency."

In this work, a fast-response fiber-optic humidity sensor for human finger motion detection was proposed based on the deposition of an L-lysine modified MXene (MXene-Lys) composite film on TFBG. The fabricated sensor demonstrated ultra-fast response kinetics, with equilibrium response and recovery times of 0.54 s and 0.48 s, respectively, in rapid cycling tests (50%-70% RH, 4 s/cycle). A linear transmittance response of 0.056 dB per %RH was observed as the ambient humidity varied, attributed to changes in the dielectric properties of the film. During a week-long humidity response stability test, the sensor exhibited excellent operational stability. Most significantly, experimental results confirmed that the sensor could accurately distinguish approach, dwell and retreat motions of a human finger at distances of 3 mm, 7 mm and 13 mm. In addition, basic hand gestures including one-, two- and three-finger movements across its surface were reliably identified."

    "abstract": "The characterization of seismic discontinuities is crucial for interpreting the geological structures they represent, such as faults and channels, which are fundamental to reservoir characterization. Transform-based methods, such as the Seislet transform, leverage sparse representations to highlight such features. However, the Seislet transform relies on local slope estimation for trace prediction within its lifting scheme framework. This approach can be suboptimal for complex seismic events involving interfering events or rapid dip changes where a single slope assumption fails. This limitation can lead to energy leakage into detail coefficients, potentially obscuring subtle discontinuities or creating artifacts. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Time Warping Seislet (DTW-Seislet) transform, a novel modification that replaces the slope-based prediction operator with one based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW finds an optimal non-linear alignment between adjacent traces, inherently adapting to complex waveform variations without assuming a single slope trend. We further enhance the prediction accuracy by incorporating a resampling strategy into the DTW process, allowing for sub-sample alignment precision. We demonstrate how analyzing the detail coefficients of the DTW-Seislet transform effectively characterizes seismic discontinuities. Validation using synthetic data and 3-D field data demonstrates that the proposed DTW-Seislet approach yields discontinuity maps with improved clarity and accuracy, better delineation of both major and subtle features, and potentially reduced noise artifacts compared to the Seislet transform and conventional C3 coherence attributes. The DTW-Seislet transform offers a promising tool for detailed seismic structural interpretation."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by blood entering the media layer of the aortic vessel wall. This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "3D mapping is vital for a broad range of applications that rely on a consistent and accurate representation of the environment. Change is an ever-persistent force in our world and with the evolution of a scene its 3D map becomes outdated. Thus, a mapping framework that can adapt and refine the 3D maps with the changes in the scene is necessary. In this paper, we propose a lifelong mapping framework where map maintenance is based on two objectives including the preservation of static structures and the refinement of the 3D map. To preserve only the static structures, we classify the object's state and remove the dynamic objects and the quasi-static objects, i.e., objects which temporarily appear static. For classifying the state of objects, we propose a discrete probabilistic solution utilizing a factor graph. Using this classification, we generate static maps from multiple sessions which are used for map refinement. The refinement is based on change detection and map update, leveraging semantic and geometric information. For the evaluation, we collect a multi-campus lifelong dataset as an extension of the MCD datasets from KTH and NTU campuses. The proposed approach is capable of accurately detecting quasi-static objects even in highly dynamic environments. Our system demonstrates state of the art performance in large scale environments. Furthermore, our approach can handle both SLAM-generated and survey-grade maps."

    "abstract": "The weighted vehicle routing problem (WVRP) is a very important extended vehicle routing problem during post-disaster scenarios for it considers not only the arrival time but also the urgency for each customer. In this paper, we tackle the multi-depot WVRP (MDWVRP), a more practical WVRP since a customer can be assigned to an appropriate depot. For MDWVRP, the number of vehicles located at each depot is restrained, and the number of the total vehicles used for all depots is also limited. To address this problem effectively, we propose a novel memetic algorithm (MA), in which an initializing scheme, a contribution-based crossover operator, and a local search method with different sizes are developed. The designed crossover operator can adjust the proportion of the arcs inserted into offspring from parents according to their fitness. In this sense, the better parent contributes more arcs to child, and vice verse. Moreover, two repair operators are applied to infeasible solution with violation of the number constraints of used vehicles so that the search can be conducted in large space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two benchmark datasets. The results show that the algorithm outperforms the leading algorithms on all instances, and updates all best-known solutions with an exception which is yet reached by the proposed algorithm. It is noticeable that most best-known solutions are improved by the algorithm with a significant level, the largest gap is over 25%."

Furthermore, the high-maneuvering tasks of the spacecraft require fast convergence of the gimbal servo system. However, the tracking performance is particularly vulnerable to disturbances (e.g. cogging torque and nonlinear friction), thereby leading to performance degradation of the CMG and the spacecraft. To address the problem, this paper proposes a fixed-time disturbance observer-based fixed-time sliding mode controller that can preassign the gimbal velocity-tracking transient performance (maximum overshoot, convergence time) and steady-state performance (accuracy). Notably, both the disturbance-estimation errors and the gimbal velocity-tracking errors are rigorously proven to converge to the expected bounded regions within a fixed time that is independent of the initial state. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "To clarify the mechanism of risk evolution in railway transportation system (RTS), swallowtail catastrophe is applied to analyze the risk state changes. Firstly, the Duffing equation is used to characterize the system. Based on historical accident data fitting results, we describe the dynamic changes of system damping and external excitation force over time when risk factors in the system, deduct the equilibrium surface function and singularity set, and establish the nonlinear state change equation of swallowtail catastrophe. Then, the mathematical characteristics of three-dimensional bifurcation set is analyzed. Based on mathematical analysis, we can find that: 1)balanced points appear or disappear in pairs; 2) bifurcation set can be classified into five parts according to the number of minimum, maximum and singular points; and 3) catastrophe of the system state can only occur on the space surface. Compared with the cusp catastrophe model commonly used in the transportation field, our paper constructed a three-dimensional control space containing three risk factors, thereby enabling a more accurate description of the system complexity under the coupling effect of multiple risk factors. Next, the energy measured by risk pulse theory is introduced to formulate risk factors base on real-world engineering experiment data, and system state change mechanism is analyzed. A case study is conducted by taking the RTS in China as the background, the results show that: when the system state control point runs from the area with more stable singularities to that with less stable singularities, and its trajectory crosses the bifurcation set, the properties of the stable equilibrium point will change, the system state will also change. When applying swallowtail catastrophe, the state changes of a RTS satisfy bimodality, inaccessibility, sudden transitions and divergence, but don’t satisfy hysteresis."

    "abstract": "Modular arithmetic enjoys a broad spectrum of applications. In recent years, the advancement of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has imposed growing demands on the flexibility and scalability of domain-specific accelerators. This article presents a fast modular reduction algorithm based on generalized Mersenne (GM) primes, which employs approximate scaling and iterative compression approaches to rapidly converge the quotient value while reducing the precomputation complexity to rely solely on the modulus itself. Building upon this algorithm, we have designed a reconfigurable modular reduction array using multiplier units with smaller word length. Operating at 1GHz, the proposed array achieves an area reduction of 45.14% compared to Barrett-based structures, and 13.93% compared to Montgomery-based structures. The array has been integrated into a complete number-theoretic transform (NTT) acceleration architecture. The resulting reconfigurable GM/general modular reduction domain-specific architecture elevates the chip frequency to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.42\\sim 1$</tex-math> </inline-formula> GHz under the same process technology. Under identical test conditions, it improves area efficiency by 10.6% and reduces energy consumption by 17.0% compared to the state-of-the-art ASIC design. When compared to the latest field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations, it achieves a reduction in area-time product (ATP) by 7.2%~18.4% for Kyber and by 13.4% for Dilithium.

Principally, we show that the mechanical structure (including stiffness and damping) couples with input parameters (frequency and magnitude) to regulate the manifested computational capabilities, and the type of PRC (if any) that can be achieved. Further, we show that input rate drives a transition between linear memory-based and nonlinear calculations, while the mechanical structure alters the conversion between longer and shorter memories. By investigating sensory limitations, we show that a spatiotemporal structure of the computational properties exists that relates to the mechanical structure, and that can be exploited to improve selected computing tasks in soft tentacle PRCs. Using the parameter dependencies we additionally provide inferences into the computational archetypes of the bodies of established soft robots."

    "abstract": "Pruning is widely researched as one of the effective methods for model compression. However, existing pruning methods still have shortcomings in achieving high model compression rates and maintaining model performance. To this end, we propose a general method called Channel And Space Pruning (CSP) for compressing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The proposed CSP method comprises Coarse-grained pruning and Fine-grained pruning, which operate on the convolutional kernels from both channel and spatial dimensions to achieve model compression. The Coarse-grained pruning utilizes a Bottleneck-based maximum flow mechanism to ensure maximum flow of inputs and outputs in DCNNs, thereby maintaining model performance. Additionally, a Bottleneck-based dynamic updating mechanism is employed to evaluate the importance of convolutional kernels, allowing for the pruning of redundant kernels while maintaining model performance. The Fine-grained pruning further compresses the model based on Coarse-grained pruning. To ensure that the parameters of the convolutional kernels obtained through Coarse-grained pruning are not spatially redundant, Fine-grained pruning employs the Parameters-free spatial attention mechanism (PSAM) for spatial sparsification of the kernels. The proposed CSP method demonstrates promising results compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in classic DCNN models."

    "abstract": "Constructing effective mixer Hamiltonians is essential for enhancing the performance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in solving combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we develop a systematic methodology for designing QAOA mixers that align with the symmetries of the classical objective function, with the goal of achieving values (mean, median, and minimum over multiple runs) that are closer to the true optimum. Our main idea is to design QAOA operators that are explicitly adapted to the action of symmetry groups on the Hilbert space. We focus on subgroups of the symmetric group <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ S_{d}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ d = 2^\\ell$</tex-math></inline-formula>, to ensure compatibility with qudit-based quantum architectures. In particular, we construct QAOA mixers invariant under the full symmetric group <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ S_{d}$</tex-math></inline-formula> as well as its cyclic subgroup <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ \\mathbb {Z}_{d} \\subset S_{d}$</tex-math></inline-formula>. These constructions are natural in that they respect the decomposition of the Hilbert space into isotypic components under the symmetry group action. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the QAOA algorithm based on the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ \\mathbb {Z}_{d}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-invariant mixer provides the first example of a QAOA protocol whose dynamics (up to final measurement) are confined entirely within a nontrivial irreducible representation of a symmetry group of the objective function. Although our work does not investigate the benefits of exploiting such subspaces as computational resources, we think that the very realization of a variational algorithm whose evolution is restricted to a nontrivial symmetry-adapted subspace is of fundamental conceptual interest. We provide closed-form expressions for these mixers, together with explicit quantum circuit implementations. To empirically evaluate our approach, we compare QAOA variants employing the standard mixer <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$B = \\sum X_{i}$</tex-math></inline-formula> with those using our proposed Hamiltonians <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$H_{M}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$H_\\chi$</tex-math></inline-formula> on edge coloring and graph partitioning problems.

    "abstract": "In response to the growing demand for rail transport, next-generation signalling systems are increasingly investigated by the railway community. In particular, the concept of Virtual Coupling (VC) is progressively gaining ground thanks to its potential ability to reduce safe train separation to less than an absolute braking distance. That enables trains to move synchronously in a vehicle-to-vehicle radio-connected convoy. One of the major concerns associated with this concept is the safe and effective control of trains in a convoy when considering varying train resistances and risk factors due to, e.g., sudden degradation in the train and communication performance. This paper develops a novel Predictive Artificial Potential Field (PAPF) approach for safe and effective real-time train control under realistic VC operations. The proposed approach uses a realistic homogeneous strip model of train motion. Moreover, it incorporates a dynamically changing safety margin to take into account risk factor occurrences, such as delays in train control and communication, or sudden emergency braking applications. A simulation-based assessment of the developed method is performed for a high-speed rail corridor in China. Results show that the proposed PAPF control algorithm effectively supervises the safe train separation, preventing activation of emergency brakes even when risk events occur. The method contributes to advancing the state of the art on VC train control."

Second, the Cross-modal Weighted Fusion (CMWF) module implements competitive sensor weighting to adaptively fuse radar and visual features across various environments, prioritizing robust modality cues under sensor degradation while enhancing spatial discriminability. Third, the Prior-Query Generation Module (PQGM) leverages radar-camera fused features to initialize detection queries enriched with radar-derived spatial priors for distant small object focusing. This module incorporates an integrated auxiliary branch employing one-to-many matching to refine the quality of generated queries during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of 35.2% mAP on nuScenes and 45.0% mAP on a custom dataset, achieving improvements of up to 1.8% mAP compared to existing fusion methods."

    "abstract": "Defect detection in multimedia data plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing. However, existing methods are primarily designed for closed-world scenarios and can only identify defect classes in the training data, limiting their ability to effectively detect unknown class defects that arise during production. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel approach by introducing industrial defect open set recognition (IDOSR), which overcomes the challenge of recognizing unknown defect classes. Furthermore, to tackle the issues of limited training samples and subtle inter-class differences in IDOSR, we present a high-frequency feature enhancement open set recognition (HFFE-OSR) method. Specifically, HFFE-OSR employs a high-frequency structural feature fusion enhancement strategy to meticulously extract and fuse defect-related high-frequency structural features. This enables the network to comprehensively learn defect target representations even under limited training samples, resulting in robust feature extraction for known classes, thereby improving the discriminability between known and unknown classes and addressing the difficulty of distinguishing between them. Additionally, a class mutual information constraint strategy is introduced to measure and reduce the mutual information among defect features from different classes. This ensures the independence of defect features across known classes, further enhancing their discriminability and significantly improving recognition performance for known classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art OSR methods on ID-OSD and MVTec datasets, achieving improvements of at least 7% in accuracy (ACC), 22% in F1 score, and 10% in AUROC, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in industrial defect detection."

This happens mainly because the existing RBFNNs overly focus on minimizing training errors, which leads to overfitting and uneven distributions of parameters. In particular, uneven distributions of parameters result in a failure of the RBFNN to cover the dynamic characteristics of the library loan volume. To solve this problem, this article proposes an efficient RBFNN with hybrid regularizations (RBF-HR) for predicting the library loan volume. In the proposed RBF-HR, we design an efficient dynamic repulsion regularization (DRR) of center and adaptive regularization of width to improve the generalization and adaptability for practical problems. We also verify the effectiveness of the proposed RBF-HR in predicting the library loan volume."

    "abstract": "The multisource inverter (MSI) serves as a high-efficiency interface for hybrid energy electric vehicles by eliminating the need for intermediate dc–dc converters. Nevertheless, modulation design for the MSI is challenging as the motor drive on the ac side and power distribution between the energy sources on the dc side should be achieved concurrently. Besides, unbalanced dc port voltage of the MSI stemming from the direct energy storage integration leads to a heavy computational burden under the asymmetrical space vector diagram. Given this, this article introduces a modulation waveform split (MWS)-based power flow control for MSIs, aiming to achieve power flow control on the dc side and motor drive control on the ac side concurrently with easy implementation. In the proposed scheme, a carrier-based pulse-width modulation with third-order harmonic injection is utilized to address motor drive control on the ac side, and an MWS scheme under the virtual two-level inverter is proposed to achieve power flow control between the dc sources. With the proposed scheme, control objectives on both ac and dc sides can be met simultaneously in the carrier-based modulation framework, without the complexity of voltage vector synthesis under an asymmetrical space vector diagram. Besides, the power conversion efficiency can also be improved due to the discontinuous characteristics of the split-obtained duty cycle waveform. The steady-state and dynamic performances validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer ranks among the most common malignancies affecting men worldwide, with rising incidence particularly in countries such as Indonesia. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for improving prognosis and treatment outcomes. This study introduces SHAP-Weighted Feature Selection, a novel approach for enhancing machine learning performance in prostate cancer classification. Unlike traditional top-N SHAP feature selection that only ranks and selects the highest-scoring features, the proposed method assigns proportional weights based on each feature's absolute contribution, allowing the model to emphasize more informative features while still retaining complementary ones. The approach is evaluated using a dataset of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0}$</tex> patient samples with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9}$</tex> clinical features, tested on six classical machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Performance was assessed under three scenarios: (1) all features, (2) top-5 SHAP features, and (3) SHAP-Weighted feature selection. The results demonstrate that the SHAPWeighted approach consistently improves classification outcomes, with Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine achieving the highest accuracy of 90%, surpassing both the baseline and top-N SHAP scenarios. These findings highlight the sensitivity of linear models to feature quality and confirm the effectiveness of SHAP-Weighted feature selection as a lightweight yet interpretable strategy for prostate cancer classification."

While existing studies often assume simultaneous or sequence-agnostic attack strategies, this paper proposes a sequence-aware CCPA framework that explicitly models the temporal coupling between cyber manipulation and physical sabotage. We enhance the classical load redistribution attack (LRA) by addressing four key limitations: detectability due to infeasible power flows, violation of power balance, omission of post-attack system response, and insensitivity to attack sequencing. Specifically, we formulate two distinct bilevel attack models, namely Cyber-to-Physical (C→P) and Physical-to-Cyber (P→C), and solve them via an exact KKT-based Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) reformulation and a scalable Benders decomposition (BD) framework. Experiments on IEEE 14-, 57-, and 118-bus systems demonstrate that C→P attacks induce significantly more line overloads than P→C, validating the heightened risk of cyber-initiated cascades. Moreover, our BD approach accurately identifies spatial vulnerability hotspots with high fidelity, even when the physical attack budget is extended from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sub>p</sub></i> = 1 to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sub>p</sub></i> = 2, confirming the framework’s scalability and practical relevance.

This article proposes a head-orientation-stabilized gait that enables the snake robot to capture wide-field video with improved stability. Given the challenge of compensating for coupled swings in both directions, the snake robot is divided into a motion part and a head-raising part, as guided by the proposed design rules. The motion section suppresses body-induced disturbances while preserving off-road locomotion capability and the head-raising section uses a hook shape to broaden the camera view and reduce residual disturbances. To generate the motion part, the S-pedal gait, suited for uneven terrain, is reformulated into Frenet–Serret-based angle functions for localized body tuning without full-shape transmission. Furthermore, setting specific rolling angles leverages segment twist angles to decouple 3-D shape formation, where pitch and yaw joints generate floating and grounding arcs, respectively, enabling independent joint modulation and enhanced swing suppression. A series of experiments validates the proposed gait, with results showing satisfactory head stabilization, wider camera coverage, and improved adaptability to challenging terrain compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals across camera views despite clothing variations, a crucial task for surveillance and security systems. Existing methods typically frame it as a cross-modal alignment problem but often overlook explicit modeling of interference factors such as clothing, viewpoints, and pedestrian actions. This oversight can distort their impact, compromising the extraction of robust identity features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that systematically disentangles interference factors from identity features while ensuring the robustness and discriminative power of identity representations. Our approach consists of two key components. First, a dual-stream identity feature learning framework leverages a raw image stream and a cloth-isolated stream, to extract identity representations independent of clothing textures. An adaptive cloth-irrelevant contrastive objective is introduced to mitigate identity feature variations caused by clothing differences. Second, we propose a Text-Driven Conditional Generative Adversarial Interference Disentanglement Network (T-CGAIDN), to further suppress interference factors beyond clothing textures, such as finer clothing patterns, viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. This network incorporates a multi-granularity interference recognition branch to learn interference-related features, a conditional adversarial module for bidirectional transformation between identity and interference feature spaces, and an interference decoupling objective to eliminate interference dependencies in identity learning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-ofthe- art approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in CC-ReID.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have revealed that extending the spatial range of informative pixels offers positive performance gains for image Super-Resolution (SR). To activate more informative pixels, considerable efforts have been devoted to exploring various variants of non-local attention mechanisms for capturing image self-similarity. However, even the state-of-the-art non-local attention mechanisms ignore an inherent property of images, namely hierarchical cross-scale self-similarity. In this paper, we propose the first Hierarchical Cross-Scale Attention (HCSA). Specifically, we first extend the search space to multiple feature maps from a single feature map, and then model cross-scale feature correspondences among different layers. This allows HCSA to activate more informative pixels for image SR by adaptively rescaling and aggregating input pixels and large-scale patches within different feature maps. To ensure accurate cross scale feature matching, we propose to replace plain down sampling operations (e.g., interpolation, pooling) with Haar Wavelet Transform (HWT) encoding, which transfers spatial information of feature maps into the channel dimension, effectively avoiding important information loss. Considering that softmax normal ization in the standard non-local attention often leads to homogeneous feature aggregation due to the amplification of small similarity weights, we propose a simple yet effective Adaptive Selection (AS) operator. This operator generates a learnable sparse mask to remove redundant features, enabling HCSA to perform discriminative feature aggregation. As a generic building block, the proposed HCSA can be flexibly integrated into existing CNN- or Transformer-based SR models, significantly strengthening cross-layer information interaction and cross-scale feature representation. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our HCSA facilitates existing SR models to achieve superior accuracy and visual quality."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a transformative paradigm for next-generation wireless systems, aiming to enable task-oriented information transmission. However, existing SemCom networks rely on cell-centric architectures, where users, particularly those at the cell edge, suffer from severe inter-cell interference and poor channel conditions. These issues undermine semantic accuracy, induce intolerable delay, and ultimately hinder the fulfillment of quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To overcome these limitations, we propose the user-centric SemCom (UCSC) network, a novel architecture that integrates user-centric networks with semantic-aware transmission. In UCSC, each user is served by a dedicated cooperative access point group, enabling effective interference mitigation and reliable semantic delivery, even at the cell edge. To fully exploit the potential of UCSC, we formulate a joint optimization problem for semantic information extraction and resource allocation, aiming to minimize total energy consumption under constraints on semantic similarity and delay. By decomposing the original problem into three tractable subproblems, semantic information extraction, computational capacity control, and power allocation, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to efficiently solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that UCSC, combined with the proposed algorithm, achieves significant performance improvements in reducing energy consumption compared with cell-centric SemCom networks, especially under stringent QoS requirements."

Additionally, integrating data from diverse sources introduces complexities stemming from experimental variability, technological differences, and data privacy concerns. Continual learning (CL) algorithms offer a promising solution by incrementally training models on data batches while addressing issues like catastrophic forgetting. However, the sequence in which these batches are presented has been largely overlooked despite its potential to influence learning efficiency and model performance. This study introduces a confidence-based batch ordering strategy for CL algorithms, leveraging confidence estimation to prioritize training samples. By structuring batches in ascending order of confidence, we observed consistent improvements in classification performance across multiple scRNA-seq datasets. Specifically, intra-dataset experiments revealed that ascending confidence ordering consistently outperformed random or descending orderings in terms of median F1 scores, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing model generalization. Similarly, inter-dataset analyses demonstrated that confidence-based ordering improved robustness when training on heterogeneous datasets generated using different sequencing protocols. Our findings highlight the critical role of batch sequencing in optimizing CL workflows for data-intensive tasks. Future research may explore the extension of this strategy to other domains and investigate adaptive confidence metrics tailored to dynamic datasets."

    "abstract": "Due to the coherent imaging mechanism of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), speckle noise hinders the interpretation of SAR images. Deep learning networks developed for SAR despeckling exhibit promising noise reduction capabilities, but it is difficult to apply the deep-learning-based model on the polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data directly. Polarimetric information is often distorted by networks due to the complex-valued channels or the normalization applied to PolSAR data. In this paper, we propose a deep learning despeckling network for PolSAR data based on the spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) model which decomposes the polarimetric coherency matrix into a normalized polarimetric coherency matrix and a texture component. Two network models are developed for polarimetric domain and texture domain separately. A block combining Swin-Transformer and convolution is used to extract global and local features of the texture, and a Complex Block was used in polarimetric domain for feature extraction of complex inputs. A new loss function of ratio balanced mean square error (RBMSE) is proposed for the texture domain filtering to help the network handle unnormalized data. PolSAR data in different frequencies and resolutions are used to illustrate the robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed deep-learning and SIRV-based dual-domain filtering algorithm achieves good performance on images acquired by different sensors. It provides a new framework for deep learning based filtering of PolSAR image."

Aiming at improving the transient performance and ensuring control accuracy of PMSMs, a predefined-time adaptive barrier function based sliding mode control algorithm (PTABFSMC) with finite-time disturbance observer is proposed for PMSM speed control in this article. First, to enhance convergence speed and reduce the chatting, a novel adaptive barrier function with dynamic boundary is proposed, and the instability and singularity of traditional barrier functions while exceeding their boundaries are solved. Second, a predefined-time sliding mode reaching law based on the barrier function is designed, and the convergence time can be predefined in advance, which is also independent of the initial conditions and disturbance. Then, by designing a nonsingular predefined-time sliding mode surface, the speed tracking controller is derived. Furthermore, to improve the anti-disturbance performance of the system, an enhanced disturbance compensation technology with a novel finite-time disturbance observer (FTDO) is designed to estimate the disturbances. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are verified through a series of comparative experiments."

In light of this potential, this article explores creating a sophisticated e-health system by combining neuro-symbolic AI with 6G wireless networks. Firstly, 6G neuro-symbolic AI, an advanced AI tool that is the fusion of a 6G wireless network, a neural network, and symbolic AI, improves cognitive modeling and decision-making, and communication speed in e-healthcare is presented. Next, an integrated architecture of a 6G-neuro-symbolic AI healthcare system is proposed, which is a combination of various aspects of AI-assisted computing and 6G transmission capabilities. Moreover, we evaluated the performance of the proposed architecture by analyzing (a) false alarm rate, (b) detection accuracy, (c) computational cost, (d) latency, and (e) energy efficiency. The evaluation results prove that 6G neuro-Symbolic AI provides better results compared to the only federated learning (FL) method.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) faces a significant challenge in separating scarce, small and subtle anomalous targets from complex backgrounds. For typical HAD approaches, background suppression is realized by building statistical or representational models. In contrast, leveraging generative models to actively erase background hyperspectral signal remains underexplored. To address the gap, this paper proposes the Mamba-enhanced background suppression diffusion model (MBSDM). The core of our approach is the integration of Mamba into a diffusion-based framework. Specifically, Mamba is employed to capture the complex global spatial-spectral features of the background. These deep features then guide the reverse diffusion process to treat the background as noise and eliminate it, thereby highlighting the anomalous targets. Furthermore, to prevent anomalies from disrupting the background learning process, we propose a new loss function designed to mitigate the training bias introduced by anomalous pixels. We compare MBSDM with other methods on multiple public datasets, and the results show that our method achieves superior and robust detection performance."

    "abstract": "Aviation electrical connectors are essential components in the aircraft electrical wiring interconnection system (EWIS), responsible for information and energy transmission. Even a minor fault in a connector pin can critically affect the reliability and stability of the EWIS. However, traditional faulty pin detection methods rely heavily on manual visual inspection, which is inefficient and susceptible to missed or false detections due to the inherent limitations of human observation. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel system-level approach that transforms the defect detection process from the physical domain to a virtual one powered by digital twin (DT) technology. A general framework for DT-based defect detection is proposed and instantiated through the design and implementation of a DT-enabled automated faulty pin detection (DT-AFPD) system. The DT-AFPD system integrates 3-D machine vision into a complete detection pipeline encompassing equipment design, data acquisition, DT model construction, algorithm development, and system deployment. Specifically, a 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) device equipped with a 3-D structured light camera is developed to acquire point cloud data of aviation connectors. Several preprocessing techniques are applied to reduce data volume and enhance point cloud quality. Based on this, a connector structure-aware faulty pin detection algorithm, named CSA-FPD, is designed to detect short and bent pins using limited data. The proposed DT-AFPD system is validated on 13 representative types of aviation electrical connectors, covering over 3600 pins. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves an average detection precision of 99.85%, effectively reducing the probability of EWIS reinstallation and enhancing the reliability of faulty pin detection."

This study presents a feasibility assessment framework for evaluating potential UAM route integration under shared-use conditions. The framework employs probabilistic trajectory prediction based on conditional Normalizing Flows to model short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, and enables UAM aircraft to perform tactical speed adjustments to maintain safe separation. A case study over the Seoul metropolitan area evaluates how UAM operations respond to surrounding air traffic across multiple altitudes and route configurations. Results show that routes positioned lower and farther from both the airport and the city center maintain greater separation margins and lower delay variability, whereas routes near the airport experience more frequent and complex interactions. The resulting separation and delay metrics provide quantitative indicators of UAM responsiveness to existing air traffic and support safety–efficiency evaluations for route planning."

This study explores the impact of two widely used oversampling techniques SMOTE and ADASYN on both model performance and interpretability. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, we perform robust preprocessing, including outlier removal via the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and train a Random Forest classifier optimized through GridSearchCV. The core novelty of this study lies in the application of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to assess how oversampling influences feature importance and model transparency. Experimental results indicate that ADASYN improves classification performance, achieving 82.01% accuracy, 70% precision, 81% recall, and 75% F1-score. Despite performance differences, both oversampling techniques maintain consistent SHAP-based feature rankings, with Glucose, BMI, and Age remaining the most influential predictors. This consistency in interpretability highlights the importance of trustworthy and explainable AI in clinical decision-making."

The method enables continuous power control without changing the switching frequency, duty cycle, or phase shift, making it suitable for DC transformer architectures that normally operate in a load-independent manner. A modified cycle-skipping approach is introduced to maintain magnetizing current during idle intervals, thereby preserving soft switching across the full operating range. The sigma-delta modulator replaces the fixed burst patterns of traditional cycle skipping with a noise-shaped pulse distribution that improves control resolution and mitigates low-frequency ripple. A practical implementation on an STM32 microcontroller is presented, including a lookup-table-based mapping of the sigma-delta bitstream to hardware burst-mode registers. Experimental validation on a 1-kW SRC-DCX prototype confirms accurate power regulation. Later demonstrated that, when extended to a dual-module IPOP configuration, the method achieves effective current balancing, with a peak efficiency of nearly 98%."

The existing control system, which relies on a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Cerio, presents limitations in terms of cost, flexibility, and scalability. This research aims to overcome these limitations by implementing an EPICS input/output Controller (IOC) on a Raspberry Pi to acquire vacuum data from a TPG-300 module. The system's network performance was rigorously validated using Wireshark to analyze key metrics: round-trip time (RTT), throughput, and packet loss. The results demonstrated excellent performance, with a majority RTT between 0.045 and 0.15 mS, stable throughput in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 0}-\\mathbf{5 5}$</tex> bits/s range, and a minimal packet retransmission rate of 1.8%. These findings confirm that the EPICS-based system is highly reliable and suitable for real-time data monitoring. This work demonstrates that implementing EPICS on low-cost hardware is a viable, scalable, and cost-effective solution, offering significant potential for adoption in other small-scale accelerator laboratories and educational facilities."

Traditional integrated approaches suffer from limited waveform diversity and poor anti-interference capability, restricting adaptability to complex environments. We propose a novel microwave photonic ISAC radar for train protection information interaction, targeting close-range perception scenarios. A photonics-assisted hardware architecture is designed to generate and process frequency-agile ultra-wideband signals, enabling high-resolution detection and high-rate communication, with experiments verifying a 20 cm ranging resolution. To address beam misalignment caused by high-speed nonlinear trajectories, a beam alignment method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty-quantified positioning information to optimize beam position arrangement. The alignment time is only 22.2% and 33.3% for the traversal method for two alignment iterations. Additionally, a time-varying track reflection multipath model is constructed, and a communication information reconstruction method is proposed to effectively compensate for phase shifts and enhance communication recovery quality under complex channels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower bit error rates and greater robustness compared to other approaches."

We propose a novel multi-modal fusion architecture specifically engineered for embedded platforms.For localization, a lightweight framework is designed that integrates Hybrid Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging (HDS-TWR) with a Taylor series-augmented full-centroid calculation algorithm. This approach, enhanced by sliding window filtering and a restructured Kalman filter covariance strategy, maintains centimeter-level positioning accuracy while achieving a 30% improvement in computational efficiency.In path tracking, an infrared-vision fusion strategy is developed. Leveraging Lab color space threshold segmentation on an OpenMV module for dynamic detection alongside a four-channel infrared sensor array for complementary perception, the system incorporates an innovative time-synchronized displacement compensation mechanism that triggers dynamic calibration. This effectively mitigates the dual limitations of single-modality systems—infrared sensitivity to ground reflectivity and visual performance degradation under extreme illumination—significantly enhancing heading control stability.For safety inspection, a streamlined YOLOv8 model is integrated, employing a TaskAlignedAssigner for dynamic sample allocation and an occlusion-weighted Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss function. This configuration achieves remarkable mAP@0.5 scores of 93.5% for head detection and 94.7% for helmet detection.The system implements a low-latency communication link via the MQTT protocol, establishing a seamless workflow from perception and localization to decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-modal inspection system significantly outperforms single-modality solutions in positioning accuracy, trajectory smoothness, and system responsiveness. Quantitative metrics, including a root mean square error of 0.016 meters and a standard deviation of 0.115 meters, robustly validate its operational efficiency and engineering practicality on resource-constrained embedded platforms."

We solve this NP-hard constrained, combinatorial satellite selection problem through Lagrangian relaxation to decompose it into simpler problems which can then be solved through subgradient methods. A high-fidelity simulation is developed based on public FCC filings and technical specifications of the Starlink and Kuiper systems. We use this case study to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and that explicit protection is indeed necessary for healthy coexistence. We further demonstrate that deep learning models can be used to predict the primary satellite system associations, which helps the secondary system avoid inflicting excessive interference and maximize its own capacity."

However, most existing fusion techniques primarily focus on pixel level integration, often neglecting the preservation of semantic consistency between the source and fused images. To address this limitation, we propose TEDFuse, a Task-Driven Equivariant Consistency Decomposition Network that ensures semantic con sistency within the image space and across high-level semantic tasks. TEDFuse incorporates two key components: first, a robust decomposition framework with equivariant consistency, ensuring that the fused image retains consistent transformation properties under shifts, rotations, and reflections, thereby enhancing local detail preservation and global semantic alignment; In addition, a task-driven fusion framework that integrates a segmentation module, reinforcing semantic feature preservation through a semantic loss function and ensuring consistency in downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection. The proposed method not only preserves the semantic coherence of the fused image but also improves performance in high-level tasks, demonstrating superior capability in multimodal fusion for complex visual applications. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of TEDFuse by analyzing feature evolution, examining the relationship between fusion quality and task performance, and discussing calibration strategies for infrared-visible image fusion.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a horizontally polarized (HP) omnidirectional filtering dielectric resonator (DR) antenna (DRA) and its circularly polarized (CP) counterpart, without extra filtering circuits. The HP filtering DRA comprises a DR and a single-layer circular substrate. A modified end-shorted Alford loop with center-shorted parasitic strips is positioned on the top of the substrate, two concentric circular slots are etched on the bottom. Wherein, the inner slot consists of four open stubs. This configuration excites three operating modes: the TE011+δ DR mode and two patch modes. Through mode cancellation between these modes, two radiation nulls are created near the passband, thus realizing filtering responses. The CP filtering design shares a highly similar structure with the HP one. The key difference lies in its bottom side, which features a single circular slot integrated with both open and shorted stubs. This setup enables filtering responses with left hand circular polarization (LHCP). Both the HP and CP filtering designs were fabricated and measured. The HP DRA features a measured -10-dB impedance bandwidth of 19% and a realized gain of 1.25 dBi within the passband.

    "abstract": "Climate change is widely recognized as one of the most urgent global challenges of our time, sparking continuous debate across scientific, political, and social domains. In addition to traditional media, social media platforms have become central spaces for public discourse, enabling individuals, organizations, and policymakers to voice opinions, share information, and influence collective understanding. Among these platforms, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$X$</tex> (formerly Twitter) stands out for its fast-paced and highly interactive nature, making it a valuable source of data for analyzing public sentiment toward climate change. This paper presents a sentiment analysis of climate change-related tweets using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains manually annotated tweets classified into four categories: pro, anti, news, and neutral. Following data preprocessing and embedding, the CNN model was trained and evaluated to assess its ability to capture nuanced sentiment in short-form texts. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 89.88 % and demonstrated strong performance across all classes, with F1scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.95. These results highlight the effectiveness of CNNs in extracting sentiment from brief and often noisy social media posts. Beyond methodological contributions, this research provides meaningful insights into public attitudes toward climate change. Such findings can assist policymakers, communicators, and environmental advocates in understanding diverse perspectives, tailoring their messaging, and fostering more productive discussions around climate change mitigation and adaptation."

    "abstract": "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and parkinsonian syndromes (PS) present similar motor symptoms, often causing misdiagnosis due to current clinical diagnostic limitations. Misdiagnosis can exacerbate patient conditions or result in unnecessary surgical interventions, thereby increasing surgical risks and the likelihood of serious postoperative complications. This study aims to develop a mixed dual-branch network for classifying CSM patients, PS patients, and healthy individuals using gait data. This study recruits 51 CSM patients, 49 PS patients, and 33 healthy controls. The kinematic data are collected and used to calculate the time series of angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration for the hip, knee, and ankle joints. From each time series, 20 features are extracted, including the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain, and nonlinear features. A dual-branch model named DCDM-Net is proposed to classify subjects through collaborative decision making (CDM) method, with one branch using ResNet with convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and evidential deep learning (EDL) loss for analyzing time series, and the other employing multilayer perceptron (MLP) for dealing with multi-domain features. DCDM-Net achieves an ACC of 92.35% ± 0.76% and an AUC of 96.70% ± 0.47% in the three-class classification task. Additionally, in binary classification scenarios, the model demonstrates robust performance with an average ACC of 93.13% and AUC of 98.34%. Furthermore, comparative evaluations show that the integrated EDL module surpasses Softmax, MC-Dropout, and Deep Ensembles in uncertainty estimation, yielding the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE of 0.0304) and lower Brier score (0.1074), indicating superior reliability. However, cross-dataset OOD validation yielded an AUROC of 0.4022 ± 0.2481 and an AUPR of 0.9699 ± 0.0162, revealing that restricting features to joint angles leads to significant distribution overlap; this conversely validates that angular velocity and acceleration are indispensable for preventing model overconfidence. Interpretable results obtained through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method and the integrated gradients (IG) method are confirmed by clinical findings. Our method provides a promising tool for diagnosing CSM and PS, with the potential to reduce misdiagnosis. The code implementation of this study is available at https://github.com/AImedcinesdu212/DCDM-Net."

    "abstract": "The ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) is a critical indicator of crop photosynthetic health, yet its accurate estimation via remote sensing remains challenging. While vegetation indices (VIs) have been widely used for this purpose, integrating them with texture features (TFs), and chlorophyll content (SPAD) to enhance model accuracy remains unexplored. To address this gap, a field experiment was conducted across the 2022-2023 winter wheat growing season. Five feature fusion strategies—combining VIs derived from UAV multispectral images, TFs extracted from UAV RGB images, and leaf chlorophyll content— were evaluated using Gaussian process (GP) and other machine learning algorithms. Results indicated significant correlations between all three VI categories and Fv/Fm. The highest correlations within each category were observed for ExGR (visible spectrum only; r = 0.80), SIPI (near-infrared without red-edge; r = 0.79), and both MCARI and NDVI705 (red-edge spectrum; r = 0.69). In contrast, TFs exhibited weaker correlations with Fv/Fm, peaking at r = -0.53 for B_M and B_VAR. However, feature selection based solely on maximal within-category correlations may yield suboptimal results due to inter-feature collinearity. Among the five fusion strategies, integrating VIs, TFs, and physiological features (SPAD) achieved optimal performance, increasing validation R² from 0.70 to 0.85 and reducing RMSE from 0.08 to 0.05 compared to single-feature models (GP regression). This approach demonstrates the viability of multi-feature fusion for accurate Fv/Fm monitoring, providing a scalable tool for precision agriculture."

    "abstract": "Utilizing communication signals to extract motion parameters has emerged as a key direction in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. Accurately modeling the relationship between communication signals and sensing performance is critical for the advancement of such systems. Unlike prior work that relies primarily on qualitative analysis, this paper derives the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for radar parameter estimation in the context of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms and Uniform Planar Array (UPA) configurations. Recognizing that vehicles may act as extended targets, we propose two New Radio (NR)-V2X-compatible beamforming schemes tailored to different phases of the communication process. During the initial beam establishment phase, we develop a beamforming approach based on the union of predictive error ellipses, which enhances scatterer localization through temporally assisted beam training. In the beam adjustment phase, we introduce an adaptive narrowest-beam strategy that leverages the positions of scatterers and the communication receiver (CR), enabling effective tracking with reduced complexity. The beam design problem is addressed using the minimum enclosing ellipse algorithm and tailored antenna control methods. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, showing up to a 32.4% improvement in achievable rate with a 32×32 transmit antenna array and a 5.2% gain with an 8×8 array, compared to conventional beam sweeping under identical SNR conditions."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. Other studies focus on exploiting the potential of edge devices through resource management optimization, yet are ultimately bottlenecked by the resource wall of individual devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PAC+</monospace>, a resource efficient collaborative edge AI framework for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning. <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PAC+</monospace> breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design.

This issue presents a significant challenge for healthcare systems tasked with their periodic generation. This paper proposes and evaluates a hybrid data architecture that mitigates these challenges by employing a passive, on-demand snapshot and ETL pipeline. The system archives raw data from the primary “hot” Firestore database into a “cold” Google Cloud Storage (GCS) layer, serving pre-formatted reports from the cold layer whenever possible. We conducted a quantitative evaluation comparing our proposed architecture against a baseline direct-access method, measuring execution time, operational cost, and storage footprint. The results demonstrate that the proposed system reduces operational costs by over 99.9 % and improves response times by up to 50 times in cached scenarios. Furthermore, our study uncovers that an asynchronous application architecture is critical for performance, resolving a severe I/O bottleneck encountered in initial synchronous deployments on a serverless platform, highlighting a key consideration for deploying such data-intensive workloads. The proposed snapshot architecture offers a practical and cost-efficient way to handle historical data reporting in pay-per-operation database environments."

This study introduces a structured refactoring process guided by SonarQube analysis and the McCall Software Quality Model to address these maintainability challenges. Various code smells, including long methods, dead code, duplicated logic, and feature envy, were systematically identified and resolved through targeted refactoring techniques. Improvements were applied to both backend and frontend modules, resulting in reduced complexity, cleaner structure, and better modularity. The findings demonstrate a significant reduction in code smells and duplication, producing a more reliable and maintainable codebase. Overall, this research highlights the role of software quality assurance in supporting critical campus applications and offers practical insights for improving maintainability in resource-constrained educational environments, with future work focusing on integrating automated testing and continuous quality monitoring."

The presented analytical modeling re-veals that certain vector combinations inherently enable simulta-neous control of both intra-phase and zero-sequence circulating currents. Then, ten candidate vector sequences are constructed us-ing those vector combinations. Since these vector sequences exhibit redundancy in the modulation region, we select the one with the lowest circulating current peak and RMS value. Subsequently, we develop a flowchart to implement the optimal vector sequences across the entire space vector plane. Quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art PWM methods demonstrate that the pro-posed method not only reduces intra-phase current but also achieves lower zero-sequence circulating current. Experimental validation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing both types of circulating currents."

    "abstract": "Formal optimization methods are now standard in antenna design, driven by the growing complexity of antenna structures and the limitations of traditional approaches such as interactive parametric studies. Reliable evaluation requires electromagnetic (EM) simulation tools; however, the need for repeated simulations during optimization makes the process computationally expensive. Existing mitigation strategies include reducing the number of EM evaluations at the algorithmic level, employing surrogate models, or using variable-fidelity models—typically restricted to two levels. In this work, we propose an adaptive model management strategy that dynamically adjusts the EM model resolution during the search process, guided by convergence and design quality indicators. The algorithm begins with the lowest acceptable fidelity, and progressively increases accuracy as the design converges and performance improves. This ensures cost savings by relying on faster, less accurate models early in the search, while switching to high-fidelity simulations near the optimum to guarantee reliability. The strategy is embedded within a gradient-based procedure. Comprehensive validation with four broadband antennas and multiple benchmark methods confirms the effectiveness of the approach, yielding an average acceleration of ~62% over the baseline method, with only minor quality deterioration."

We introduce reVISit 2, a software framework that supports visualization researchers at all stages of designing and conducting browser-based user studies. ReVISit supports researchers in the design, debug & pilot, data collection, analysis, and dissemination experiment phases by providing both technical affordances (such as replay of participant interactions) and sociotechnical aids (such as a mindfully maintained community of support). It is a proven system that can be (and has been) used in publication-quality studies-which we demonstrate through a series of experimental replications. We reflect on the design of the system via interviews and an analysis of its technical dimensions. Through this work, we seek to elevate the ease with which studies are conducted, improve the reproducibility of studies within our community, and support the construction of advanced interactive studies."

Our method, termed Particle Diffusion Matching (PDM), performs alignment through an iterative Random Walk Correspondence Search (RWCS) guided by a diffusion model. At each iteration, the model estimates displacement vectors for particle points by considering local appearance, the structural distribution of particles, and an estimated global transformation, enabling progressive refinement of correspondences even under difficult conditions. PDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple retinal image alignment benchmarks, showing substantial improvement on a primary dataset of SFI-UWFI pairs and demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world clinical scenarios. By providing accurate and scalable correspondence estimation, PDM overcomes the limitations of existing methods and facilitates the integration of complementary retinal image modalities. This diffusion-guided search strategy offers a new direction for improving downstream supervised learning, disease diagnosis, and multi-modal image analysis in ophthalmology."

Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based dynamic calibration of IMU is adapted here because it accurately transmits statistical distributions without linearization, which is better at managing non-linear INS dynamics than the Extended Kalman Filter. Further, MDOR mechanism is proposed to identify and exclude erroneous GNSS measurements before the filter update, whereas, IAE technique is proposed to dynamically tune the filter's noise covariance. A hardware setup is developed using a GNSS receiver, IMU sensor, and microcontroller to capture data for real vehicular trajectories. The proposed framework has been implemented in MATLAB and further experimentally demonstrated with real trajectory data. The navigation accuracy of the proposed method exhibits upto 75% improvement with respect to conventional LC integration. The contribution lies on careful integration and validation of dual-layer architecture with inter-layer feedback mechanism and nested-architecture for known UKF-based IMU calibration. The proposed framework can provide a precise navigation solution to improve resilience even in partial GNSS challenging areas."

Using a commercial refrigerator (Panasonic NR-A195L/2014, –18°C setpoint, ±0.5°C stability) and a Micron Optics SM-130 interrogator (1 pm resolution, 1 kHz sampling), we evaluated 3D printed water column holders with depths from 5 mm down to 500 μm. Through targeted signal processing, we successfully isolated both the icing and deicing spectral signatures. The sensor reliably produced the characteristic icing spectral signature for columns ≥ 500 μm, establishing this as the system's minimum detectable thickness. Five consecutive freeze and thaw cycles confirmed negligible drift and stable onset amplitudes. Crucially, we introduce a fog-immunity protocol using an ultrasonic mist maker to show that sub threshold frost does not trigger false positives. These novel experimental structures and validation procedures substantiate the FBG phase-transition sensor's robustness and specificity, paving the way for reliable real-time icing surveillance in aerospace, renewable-energy, and power-transmission applications."

To address these limitations, we propose a targetdriven, phase-gradient-aware ring-by-ring optimization for designing an achromatic and coma-corrected LWIR hybrid metalens with an 8.4mm diameter. The refractive geometry and wavelength-dependent metalens phase compensation is jointly optimized across the 8-12 μm band and a 41.4° full field of view.

    "abstract": "Despite rapid progress in data-driven fault diagnosis for Railway Point Machines (RPMs), most studies tacitly assume a fixed sensing setup: predefined sensor types, placements, channels, and sampling rates. This leaves a critical gap: the sensing layer (i.e., the sensor configuration of the monitoring system) itself is rarely optimized for the diagnostic task, cost constraints, or robustness to real-world disturbances. We address this gap by formulating sensor-configuration optimization as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), framing it as a task-aligned decision problem. To solve this, we introduce the Policy-guided Sensor Reduction and Optimization Network (PSRONet), a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that learns a deployable sensing policy (selected channels and sampling interval) to maximize diagnostic accuracy under acquisition budgets. The PSRONet optimizes a multi-objective reward that balances accuracy and sensor cost (quantified by data overhead), and explicitly incorporates robustness terms reflecting sensor anomalies and environmental interference encountered in field deployments. Trained offline with a fast “Fidelity Oracle” surrogate of the downstream classifier, the PSRONet outputs a deterministic configuration that is simple to implement on existing hardware. Experiments on real-world RPM data across diverse operating conditions show that the PSRONet establishes a stronger accuracy–cost Pareto frontier than many existing methods. It retains near 91% of full-data diagnostic performance with over 92% lower acquisition overhead and remains robust to sensor anomalies and environmental interference. To our knowledge, this is the first RPM-oriented, DRL-based framework that directly optimizes the sensor layer for fault diagnosis, providing a practical path toward cost-aware and robust PHM in railway operation and maintenance."

This article proposes a new hybrid-domain-informed and current-adaptive parameter identification method for fractional-order equivalent circuit models to address the limitations of traditional time- and frequency-domain approaches. The method first utilizes frequency-domain impedance data across various state-of-charge (SOC) levels to extract polarization-related parameters, ensuring strong physical interpretability. Time-domain signals are then employed to identify ohmic and diffusion-related parameters, mitigating the challenges of time consuming of low-frequency impedance measurements and high-frequency stray parameters interference. Furthermore, time-domain data with varying current amplitudes are used to adaptively refine parameter identification, enhancing accuracy under different load conditions. The identified parameters are integrated into a battery model capable of adapting to different SOC levels and current amplitudes.

Although recent underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods rely on the current advances in deep neural network architecture designs, there is still considerable room for improvement in cross-scene robustness and computational efficiency. Diffusion models have shown great success in image generation, prompting us to explore their application to UIE tasks. However, directly applying them to UIE tasks will pose two challenges, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, high computational budget and color unbalanced perturbations. To tackle these issues, we propose DiffColor, a distribution-aware diffusion and cross-spectral refinement model for efficient UIE. Unlike single-noise image restoration tasks, underwater imaging exhibits unbalanced channel distributions due to the selective absorption of light by water. To address this, we design the Global Color Correction to balance the diverse color shifts, thereby avoiding potential global degradation disturbances during the denoising process. Instead of diffusing in the raw pixel space, we transform the image into the wavelet domain to obtain such low-frequency and high-frequency spectra. For the sacrificed image details caused by underwater scattering, we further present the Cross-Spectral Detail Refinement to enhance the high-frequency details, which are then integrated with the low-frequency signal as a dual-condition for guiding the diffusion. This strategy ensures the high-fidelity of sampled content and compensates for the sacrificed details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DiffColor over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations."

    "abstract": "Wearable lifelog data provides continuous physiological and behavioral signals, enabling contextual understanding of users’ real-world states. However, conventional recommendation models rely heavily on static behavioral logs and fail to incorporate contextual variability, leading to limited personalization and biased decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes a case-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that integrates case routing, federated learning (FL), and reinforcement learning (RL) for context-adaptive action recommendation. The model first classifies user states—derived from multimodal lifelog features such as heart-rate variability, activity intensity, sleep patterns, and fatigue—into multiple context-specific cases. A shared DeepFM–SASRec backbone encodes both static and sequential physiological patterns, while case-specific Adapter, LoRA, and MoE expert heads refine representations to capture intra-case variability. Federated learning enables robust model training under heterogeneous; privacy-sensitive lifelog distributions, and reinforcement learning optimizes long-term physiological improvement by modeling state transitions and action outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves substantial gains in both accuracy and fairness. The final variant improves HitRate@20 from 0.628 to 0.881 (+40.3%) and reduces Bias Ratio from 0.92 to 0.64 (–30%), effectively balancing precision and behavioral diversity. These findings confirm that combining case-based routing, MoE specialization, FL-driven robustness, and RL-based policy optimization provides a powerful and scalable foundation for next-generation lifelog-driven action recommendation systems."

    "abstract": "Multiphase and multi-component fluid flows are highly intricate, exhibiting dynamic behaviors that challenge conventional simulation methods, especially across a wide range of operating conditions. Adding fluid-solid interactions further escalates this complexity, requiring simulations that are both physically accurate and computationally more tractable. Existing methods often fall short in aspects of either accuracy, efficiency, or stability, and sometimes may also consume excessive memory, rendering them unsuitable for many practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel, more practical solution combining a collision-enhanced lattice Boltzmann method with a finite-volume approach. This hybrid solver is designed to effectively simulate multiphase, multi-component flows via the phase-field modeling with a novel wetting boundary treatment in the finite-volume framework, while significantly reducing memory consumption. It enables simulations of multiple fluid phases under varied conditions, capturing rich interfacial behaviors. Additionally, it incorporates an immersed-boundary method to efficiently handle complex fluid-solid interactions. Validation tests confirm that our method produces physically consistent results and demonstrates accuracy across multiple evaluations. We provide comprehensive simulation results, along with comparisons of memory consumption and efficiency, highlighting the practical utility and superiority of our solver over conventional methods."

    "abstract": "A remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method for high-voltage (HV) DC contactors in new energy vehicles is proposed, based on acoustic-electrical signal feature fusion and TCN-Transformer. Since the contactors are typically located within vehicle HV boxes or battery packs, insulation degradation is used as the failure criterion. By monitoring the electrical signals of the contacts and acoustic signals during closing throughout the operation of the contactor, on the basis of the conventional features of performance degradation, the features of acoustic signals are explored to enable a diversified analysis of the performance degradation process. Key features reflecting performance degradation are selected and fused using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), resulting in a performance degradation factor. This factor shows a strong correlation with real-time insulation resistance measurements, supporting degradation analysis that incorporates insulation characteristics. Using hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm based on the degradation factor, multi-stage degradation analysis is conducted to accurately identify the final stage of degradation. A feature vector for RUL prediction is then constructed by combining key features and the degradation factor, and the TCN-Transformer model is applied to predict the RUL of the contactors at the final stage of degradation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in quantitatively predicting the RUL of onboard contactors."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the adaptive fuzzy distributed optimal control problem for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) under the predefined-time stability theory. The addressed controlled nonlinear MASs contain unknown dynamics, immeasurable states, and input saturations. To solve unknown dynamics and immeasurable states problems, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to model the uncertain nonlinear MASs, and an adaptive fuzzy distributed state observer is designed to estimate the unknown states. Then, based on the designed state observer and differential graphical game, a predefined-time distributed optimal output feedback controller is formulated. To implement the fuzzy distributed optimal output feedback controller, a fuzzy reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to learn the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, in which fuzzy logic systems are used as a critical network, and its weights adaptive laws are designed by current and historical data. It is proven that the proposed adaptive fuzzy distributed optimal controller with reinforcement learning algorithm can guarantee the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and reaches the Nash equilibrium within the given finite-time settling time without needing the restrictive persistent excitation (PE) condition. Finally, the computer simulation results and comparison with the existing optimal control method illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed optimal control scheme."

    "abstract": "A semigroup characterization, or equivalently, a characterization by the generator, is a classical technique used to describe continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems. In the realm of data-driven learning for an unknown nonlinear system, one must estimate the generator of the semigroup of the system's transfer operators (also known as the semigroup of Koopman operators) based on discrete-time observations and verify convergence to the true generator in an appropriate sense. As the generator encodes essential instantaneous transitional information of the system, challenges arise for some existing methods that rely on accurately estimating the time derivatives of the state with constraints on the observation rate. Recent literature develops a technique that avoids the use of time derivatives by employing the logarithm of a Koopman operator. However, the validity of this method has been demonstrated only within a restrictive function space and requires knowledge of the operator's spectral properties. In this paper, we propose a resolvent -type method for learning the system generator to relax the requirements on the observation frequency and overcome the constraints of taking operator logarithms. We also provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness in applications of system identification and constructing Lyapunov functions."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel technique is proposed to widen the beamwidth of a millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging radar system that employs a mechanically scanning elliptic toroidal reflector antenna. For applications requiring Doppler measurements, increased beamwidth enhances Doppler resolution while maintaining scanning speed, enabling improved extraction of micro-Doppler features. The reflector antenna’s beamwidth is widened by employing a feed horn with an adjustable phase center. Relying on the fact that the horn’s phase center is near its aperture, the design incorporates a hollow cylindrical sleeve that extends the aperture forward, thereby shifting the phase center. This phase center displacement de-focuses the reflector and results in a wider radar beam. The design of the feed horn and its electrically actuated sleeve is presented, along with fabrication details. The phase center position of the horn is determined using two experimental techniques. In the first, the horn is placed behind a dielectric lens illuminated by a plane wave, and the phase center is localized by identifying the position that maximizes the received signal power. In the second method, coherent signal measurements on the plane perpendicular to the horn’s boresight are collected using a network analyzer and processed to localize its phase center. In both techniques, the phase center is shown to shift when the sleeve is extended. Beam widening is verified by measuring the reflector’s radiation pattern with the sleeve both extended and retracted, showing good agreement with simulations. A beamwidth increase by a factor of four is demonstrated using a 20 mm sleeve extension. The technique’s effectiveness is further validated through Doppler measurements of a walking person, where Doppler spread is observed using the de-focused beam at scanning speeds of up to 5 cycles per second."

A novel algorithm was introduced to assess the hemodynamic consequences of ischemia by quantifying changes in cardiac function. The algorithm calculated the ratio between the IK and JJ intervals of the ballistocardiography (BCG) waveform, a temporal feature that serves as a biomarker for myocardial contractility impaired by ischemia. An initial cohort of 5 healthy subjects and 5 patients with myocardial ischemia was used to establish a diagnostic threshold, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.9556. A separate clinical validation with 5 additional subjects subsequently confirmed the system's effectiveness. The analysis demonstrated that an 8-second signal duration was sufficient for accurate detection, and processing times ranging from 1.2 ms to 30.7 ms across various hardware platforms affirmed the system's real-time capability. The results highlight a robust and non-invasive system for continuous cardiac monitoring, offering an automated and objective tool to support the early clinical detection of myocardial ischemia."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a compact avalanche photodiode (APD) package designed to suppress electromagnetic interference (EMI) using a vertically stacked RC filter and orthogonal wire bonding. Conventional TO packages typically exhibit less than 5 dB of rejection at 1 GHz due to significant lens-aperture RF leakage. The proposed package integrates a high-voltage decoupling capacitor directly beneath the APD and a stacked bias filter, forming a differential loop that cancels RF signals leaked through the lens aperture. Implemented in a TO-style housing, the structure reduces parasitic interconnect length and improves mechanical stability. Experimental results demonstrate over 25 dB of rejection for common‑mode RF interference across the 100 MHz to 2 GHz frequency range, with suppression exceeding 30 dB at 1 GHz. In addition, the package achieves a 3-dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under realistic 1-GHz Wi-Fi interference, making it suitable for 5G optical receivers and other EMI-sensitive optical communication systems. Future work will extend the design to multi-band EMI modeling and long-term reliability validation. This work presents a robust solution for enhancing the sensitivity and reliability of optical receivers in high-EMI environments."

In the MP-PE game, the D3QN algorithm, which incorporates deep, dueling and double Q-learning methods is used for training CBPE-based assignment policies for both pursuer and evader teams. In this case, Nash equilibrium (NE) approximate solutions of CBPE-based assignment policies are derived, which are equivalent to NE control policies for the MP-PE game. The goal of this article is to develop approximate NE CBPE-based assignment policies trained by the D3QN algorithm which are equivalent to NE control policies for both pursuer and evader teams in the MP-PE game. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are provided for analyzing the equivalence between NE CBPE-based assignment policies and NE control policies. Furthermore, with the compression mapping condition, the convergence and optimality of the D3QN algorithm are obtained for NE CBPE-based assignment policies of the MP-PE game. Finally, illustrative examples and experiments are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed NE CBPE-based assignment policies trained by the D3QN algorithm."

    "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offer significant potential for mechanical energy harvesting, but their development is constrained by the trade-off between high charge trapping capability and adequate electrical conductivity, which limits energy conversion efficiency. To tackle this issue, a dual-modification strategy involving the incorporation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was developed. PTFE was introduced to enhance charge trapping through its strong electron affinity, while MWCNTs formed a conductive network to facilitate rapid charge transport. Under optimized doping concentrations of 5 wt.% PTFE and 0.25 wt.% MWCNTs, the composite exhibited substantial performance enhancements, with open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and transferred charge increased by 294.43%, 521.0%, and 252.55%, respectively, compared to pure PDMS. A peak power density of 8.37 W/m² was achieved under a 20 MΩ load. The composite membrane exhibited a tensile strength of 4.21 ± 0.42 MPa, elastic modulus of 1.45 ± 0.07 MPa, and elongation at break of 169.80 ± 18.69%. The device displayed excellent thermal stability (20-100 °C) and slight UV-enhanced output, despite degradation at high humidity, it successfully retained 70.76% of its initial voltage at moderate humidity levels (55-65% RH). It maintained stable electrical output after 5000 seconds of continuous operation under mechanical stress, and generated clear voltage signals during various human motions such as walking, running, and jumping. Additionally, our motion recognition model based on deep learning techniques attained a high accuracy of 99.95%, demonstrating its effectiveness in action classification tasks. Combined with a UI visualization interface, it enabled the assessment of motion energy consumption. This study demonstrates an effective material design strategy for improving TENG performance and provides valuable insights for the advancement of high-efficiency wearable energy harvesting and information fusion systems."

    "abstract": "Existing dynamic scene visual SLAM methods indiscriminately remove feature points on dynamic target bounding boxes when using object detection algorithms to detect prior targets, resulting in the incorrect removal of some valid static points and affecting the localization accuracy of the algorithm. This paper proposes a visual SDT-SLAM algorithm, which uses YOLOv11 to determine the prior target information of each frame of the image and designs a short-term dynamic object tracking algorithm to track targets and classify feature points in real time for different categories of bounding boxes. In the state estimation process, a depth difference estimation algorithm is used to recover some erroneously deleted static feature points, and an epipolar constraint algorithm is used to filter dynamic feature points from the scene in a fine-grained manner. This method precisely distinguishes the dynamic and static feature points in dynamic scenes. Compared with other SLAM systems, this system reasonably utilizes depth information to restore static feature points in dynamic scenes, and based on semantic information and epipolar constraints, it removes incorrect matching points, significantly preserving and fully utilizing the static feature points in dynamic scenes. This further improves the trajectory estimation accuracy of the SLAM algorithm in dynamic scenes. Without relying on computationally intensive segmentation methods, it achieves a new balance between real-time performance and accuracy. The SDT-SLAM algorithm was validated on the TUM and Bonn public datasets and in the real world. The results show that SDT-SLAM has advantages in speed and accuracy for localization in highly dynamic environments compared to other advanced algorithms."

Accurate water level forecasts are critical for water resource management and flood mitigation. However, most existing water level prediction models do not consider the unique river-lake interaction in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and virtual stations. This study proposes an ensemble graph and series decomposition model for water level prediction at both real and virtual stations in the Yangtze River. We present a module for water level prediction in regions without monitoring stations, filling gaps in traditional water level monitoring systems. Our model utilizes graph convolutional network (GCN) to model spatial dependencies between monitoring stations, and graph attention network (GAT) to capture river-lake interaction. Time series are decomposed into trend and seasonal series, followed by Transformer to extract long-range dependencies. In addition, a hierarchical ensemble method combining hierarchical clustering, stacking, and AdaBoost is introduced to enhance the robustness and generalization of our method. Numerical experiments conducted on real historical water level data in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in China and the Mackenzie River in Canada validate the effectiveness of our model. Compared to existing studies, our model achieves an average reduction of 35.88% in MAE and 26.28% in RMSE in 12-timestep water level prediction."

    "abstract": "In indoor dynamic environments, robots rely on visual SLAM to perceive and understand their surroundings. However, the presence of moving objects violates the static-world assumption, thereby degrading the accuracy and robustness of visual SLAM localization. Although most dynamic visual SLAM approaches achieve satisfactory localization performance in dynamic scenarios, they typically reject dynamic points solely based on semantic information, without considering semantic associations across frames. This limitation results in insufficient exploitation of temporal semantic consistency, which could otherwise enhance robustness in dynamic environments. To address this issue, we propose CSM-SLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system that incorporates a cross-frame semantic matching (CSM) strategy. By leveraging semantic patches and their temporal correspondences, our approach enables robust identification and removal of dynamic feature points, thereby refining pose estimation. CSM-SLAM is developed on top of ORB-SLAM3 and evaluated on the TUM and BONN datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately eliminate dynamic feature points, achieving up to a 90% improvement in localization accuracy compared to ORB-SLAM3 in dynamic scenarios. The code for the cross-frame semantic matching method proposed in this paper is available at https://github.com/wyyaa123/CSM.git."

The designed generalized FTVGCADRC achieves smooth switching between the linear ADRC and finite-time ADRC, thereby combining the advantages of both linear ADRC and finite-time ADRC. By employing error-driven variable gain mechanisms, both the nonsmooth switching problem and the switching stability problem are avoided from analysis. Moreover, the stability analysis of the generalized FTVGCADRC is performed by robust analysis methods, and the existence of feasible solutions is discussed and expressed explicitly.

    "abstract": "Existing fall detection based on radar point cloud faces the challenges of low resolution point cloud estimation and sparsity, which seriously restricts the system detection performance. This study proposes an innovative radar point cloud generation method combining compressed sensing and a depth camera to improve the accuracy and robustness of the fall detection system. Specifically, the study reformulates radar point cloud direction of arrival (DOA) estimation as a linear inverse problem and solves it using compressed sensing (CS) with the fast approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, significantly improving point cloud positional resolution compared with the traditional fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. Subsequently, an Encoder-Decoder network based on the attention mechanism is designed to effectively enhance the density and expression ability of the point cloud by capturing the local features of the radar point cloud. The depth camera in this article is only used in the network training process. In the actual fall detection stage, the system only uses radar signals for classification. The experimental results verify the advantages of the proposed method in indoor fall detection. Compared with the traditional FFT-based point cloud generation results, the detection accuracy is improved from ∼ 91% to ∼ 96%. The innovative method proposed in this paper provides an efficient, economical, and easy-to-deploy technical solution for fall detection systems in the smart home environment, which has significant potential applications."

    "abstract": "During industrial processes operation, fault diagnosis needs to rely on finite and imbalanced samples for learning because the equipment is usually in a normal operation state and the probability of faults is low. For this issue, we propose a new attention ensemble algorithm, DMSAM-OAdB. First, the multiscale sparse attention module (MSAM) extracts and fuses feature information from different scales to establish the correlation among features and adaptively adjusts the feature weights by soft thresholding operation to emphasize the critical features while filtering the redundant information. Subsequently, a deep network model (DMSAM) constructed by stacking multiple convolutional layers and MSAMs is iteratively trained as the base classifier for the optimized AdaBoost algorithm (OAdB). The OAdB dynamically increases the weights of misclassified samples while mitigating class imbalance by randomly zeroing out the weights of a certain number of correctly classified majority class samples. Finally, the improved focal loss (IFL) function enhances the model’s discrimination capability for minority class samples. Experiments on the industrial coking furnace validate the reliability and superiority of the proposed methodology."

The method leverages graph-structured data to enhance the representation of distribution system states and employs graph attention networks (GATs) to deeply explore the power flow features and spatial characteristics of nodes in the restoration process. Additionally, a multihead self-attention (MHSA) is incorporated to strengthen collaboration among heterogeneous agents, enabling them to focus on relevant information from multiple perspectives during training. Finally, a joint simulation test platform is developed using Python and OpenDSS, and case studies on a 123-bus distribution system are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves efficient and autonomous service restoration by enhancing spatial feature extraction and improving collaborative decision-making among agents."

Maintaining data freshness, quantified by the age of information (AoI), while minimizing energy consumption is highly challenging due to UAV mobility, heterogeneous agents, and limited resources. This paper formulates a joint optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the long-term average AoI and energy consumption of UAVs and GUs under realistic constraints, including quality of service (QoS), queue size, and resource limitations. To tackle this complex mixed discrete–continuous problem, we propose a swarming behavior-integrated multi-agent multi-expert soft actor-critic (MA-MESAC) framework that synergizes swarm intelligence with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The actor network employs self-attention to model intra-agent dependencies, while the critic network uses cross-attention to capture inter-agent spatial–temporal correlations. We design a composite actor loss function by integrating the SAC-based policy objective with regularization terms that enforce fair resource allocation and physics-informed swarming behavior, ensuring stable and efficient learning. Moreover, we design a multi-objective reward function that explicitly accounts for stringent mobility, QoS, and resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances fairness-aware data freshness, energy efficiency, and convergence compared with existing baselines."

    "abstract": "Set-valued data, an important data form expressing diversity and uncertainty, is widely used in fields such as recommendation systems and social network analysis. However, such data often contains fine-grained records, which may lead to the leakage of users’ sensitive information. To this end, some privacy-preserving set-valued data analysis schemes have been proposed. This paper first proposes a joint shift inference attack against the cyclic shift-based local differential privacy (LDP) protocol introduced by Huang et al. (10.1109/TIFS.2024.3423657), it exploits deterministic cyclic-shift patterns and significant frequency differences to infer the user’s original data. Experimental results demonstrate that the user’s original data can be inferred with a probability exceeding 96%. Theoretically, the cyclic-shift mechanism violates the core requirement of local differential privacy due to its non-surjective output space. To overcome the limitations of existing schemes, we propose a privacy-preserving joint distribution analysis scheme for set-valued data via LDP (SVJDA). It employs the Sparse Vector Mean Estimation (SVME) mechanism and utilizes a sign-based hashing function to compress data, allowing privacy-preserving joint distribution analysis while introducing only minimal additional noise. Theoretical analysis shows that SVJDA satisfies ϵ-LDP with minimal estimation error. The experimental results confirm that SVJDA achieves higher accuracy in joint distribution estimation while ensuring the accuracy of frequent itemset identification. For ϵ ∈ [0.4, 1], the L∞ error of SVJDA is only 7.208%–21.725% of SVSM and 2.821%–7.279% of LDP-RM, while its MSE is 0.00364%–2.338% of SVSM and 0.017%–0.068% of LDP-RM, demonstrating its superior performance."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia with a globally increasing prevalence. Early diagnosis is crucial to slow disease progression and improve patients' quality of life. Therefore, previous studies have proposed automatic prediction to address the limitations of manual interpretation of brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. However, these approaches often encounter significant challenges, including class imbalance, where minority classes are frequently underrepresented. This study investigates EfficientNetB0 for Alzheimer's MRI classification under three data regimes—original, SMOTE-balanced, and augmented—using identical splits and training settings. We use a subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing four classes (Non-Demented, Very Mild, Mild, Moderate). Both SMOTE and data augmentation contribute to improving the performance of the EfficientNetB0 model for Alzheimer's MRI classification. SMOTE enhances the overall F1-score from 0.9738 to 0.9757, while data augmentation delivers the best overall generalization with an F1-score of 0.9773. Although both SMOTE and data augmentation still struggle to enhance the correct prediction of the highly minority class, these strategies also improve prediction accuracy in the other classes. Grad-CAM results confirm that both approaches guide model attention toward Alzheimer's-relevant brain regions, validating their clinical interpretability."

A key priority of the F5G group is to develop a greener network solution by enhancing overall energy efficiency, especially in routing and computing. This induces the practical challenges related to comprehensively understanding energy utilization across the entire network infrastructure. These requirements align with the concept of an energy-efficient monitoring system, which aims to track, analyze and manage energy usage to enable autonomous network reconfiguration. To this end, we introduce a novel distributed energy monitoring system that empowers network operators to collect, process, and analyze energy utilization at various points in the network. By offering these insights, this system is a pathway to network automation. Additionally, the proposed system offers capabilities to measure energy generation of both local and external sources, as well as energy consumed by heating and cooling subsystems. We evaluated the proposed monitoring architecture on a lab testbed demonstration by detecting the underutilized port, rerouting the traffic to alternative path, prior to enabling low power port mode to save energy. The results validated the practicality and functionality of our proposed approach.

The widespread deployment of 5G has connected a massive number of devices and users to IoT networks, accelerating the expansion of IoT scales. IoT users’ service requirements exhibit heightened diversity and dynamism. Consequently, the SFC placement problem in Next Generation Multi-domain IoT (NGMIoT) networks has garnered significant attention. How to efficiently place SFCs under uncertain resource demands to adapt to evolving service request dynamics poses substantial challenges. Therefore, this paper investigates the Robust SFC Placement (RSFCP) problem in NGMIoT networks under resource demand uncertainty. Specifically, we formulate the RSFCP problem as an integer linear programming model to minimize overall SFC placement cost while ensuring service quality. We further prove the RSFCP problem is NP-hard and propose a greedy strategy based heuristic SFC placement algorithm to solve it. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate performance, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark mechanisms in terms of service acceptance rate and placement cost."

However, they have significant limitations in the deep learning area due to their difficulty in capturing complex data structures, such as spatial and contextual information. This issue is especially pronounced in neuroimaging research, where high-dimensional and complex data greatly restricts the feature representation capability of clustering models. Hence, we propose a Neuroimaging Deep Clustering (NIDC) backbone network. We convert 3D neuroimagings into point sets and design clustering-based paradigms for context feature aggregation, feature interaction, and feature dispatching to enable deep feature extraction from the point sets. To better capture spatial information, we propose brain spatial relative position encoding, which assists the clustering paradigm in better understanding the anatomical structure of brain tissue and the positional relationships between different regions. Additionally, we design a sample center loss function to encourage tighter clustering of labels or voxels/feature points of the same class in the feature space, aiming to suppress both inter-class and intra-class similarities. Meanwhile, NIDC preserves the interpretability of traditional clustering techniques, allowing it to uncover relationships between brain regions and trace the decision-making process of each voxel. NIDC achieves highly competitive performance across multiple datasets in various downstream tasks, emerging as a new and practical solution for neuroimaging analysis.

This work introduces CMM-Ax, a deployable hybrid CXL-PNM system that combines streaming near-memory pipelines with device-side programmability and integrates tightly with the Heterogeneous Memory Software Development Kit (HMSDK). Through HMSDK, CMM-Ax exposes CXL-attached memory via standard Linux allocation paths (e.g., malloc and mmap). This allows existing vector databases and search engines to adopt heterogeneous memory with minimal application-level changes, such as selecting the CMM-Ax FAISS backend. CMM-Ax further provides a comprehensive software stack—FAISS integration, a domain-specific compiler for user-defined operators, and a Kubernetes device plugin supporting multi-tenant slicing—capabilities not demonstrated in prior CXL-PNM. Using an FPGA-based CXL Type-3 prototype, CMM-Ax achieves 4.54× higher throughput and 5.56× lower energy per query than a CXL memory-only baseline on the exact k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search. For approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) inverted-file (IVF) workloads, CMM-Ax sustains bandwidth-proportional efficiency at small batches (batch=1: 37% vs. 12% CPU, 7% GPU).

The data is transmitted via modulated audio using a soundcard and AUX cable, and then transmitted through the HT radio. The received data is stored in a MySQL database and visualized through a website dashboard using the Laravel framework for real-time monitoring. The Quality of Service (QoS) analysis results show that the system has an average delay of 9 seconds, a throughput of 1 packet per second, and a packet loss rate of 11.28%. Functional testing indicates a maximum speed of 18.65 km/h, a minimum speed of 0.02 km/h, and an average speed of 5.26 km/h, with a data transmission success rate of 88.72%. A comparison between the Ublox Neo 8 GPS sensor and Google GPS shows good accuracy with an average difference of about 10 meters in terms of distance and altitude. The Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) values range from 0.8 to 1.2, indicating a high level of accuracy. However, the average Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of 18.75 dB suggests a relatively low signal quality. The predictions from the Radio Frequency Planner align with field conditions and are very useful in strategizing antenna placement and other equipment to optimize communication networks in large areas.

Web-interface models rejected 41.5% of potentially malicious prompts, whereas API-access models blocked only 13.4%, a 3.1× difference in protective behavior. Cross-database testing showed MySQL to be most susceptible (12.1% successful attacks), SQLite moderately vulnerable (8.1%), and PostgreSQL the most resilient (1.7%). We further assessed four popular SQLi-detection techniques—regular-expression matching, classical machine learning, a convolutional neural network, and a RoBERTa-based contextual model. All experienced severe performance degradation when confronted with LLM-generated queries: overall accuracy plummeted from roughly 98% on standard SQLi benchmarks to just 60% on our test set. Even the context-aware embedding model failed to reliably flag malicious patterns in LLM outputs. Our work contributes (i) the first comprehensive characterization of SQLi risks posed by LLMs, (ii) a publicly released evaluation framework with expert-validated test cases, and (iii) evidence of critical blind spots in current SQLi-detection mechanisms that must be addressed to secure next-generation LLM applications."

    "abstract": "As dc–dc converters operate at the very high-frequency (VHF, 30–300 MHz) range, the nonlinear parasitic capacitance of switching devices increasingly impacts their performance, especially since the ON-state resistance of the switch is highly related to the parasitic capacitance. Conventional design methods typically approximate the nonlinear parasitic capacitance with a fixed value, which significantly limits design accuracy and may compromise soft-switching performance as nonlinearity increases. Hence, this article proposes an optimal design method that first employs a discrete iterative numerical solution to perform steady-state analysis for the inverter and rectifier stages, considering nonlinear parasitic capacitance. Then, the gradient descent algorithm is used to decouple their design. Compared with existing design methods, the proposed one can effectively capture the nonlinear behavior in the design process, resulting in higher accuracy under highly nonlinear parasitic capacitances. This is beneficial for selecting switching devices with small ON-state resistance <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dson</sub> to improve efficiency and reduce external discrete capacitance to enhance power density.

    "abstract": "Surgical phase recognition (SPR) is essential for surgical workflow analysis and provides immediate guidance during procedures. Existing methods aggregate frame-level information into a global representation and treat the task as frame-wise classification. However, this pipeline lacks a feedback mechanism for integrating historical information into local temporal modeling. To address this limitation, we propose the Bidirectional Branch Query Network (B2Q-Net), which reformulates the SPR task as the bidirectional query between phase-level features and frame-level features. B2Q-Net incorporates historical information during the initialization of phase queries. This enables bidirectional information flow during iterative refinement of two-level feature maps between phases and frames. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-scale selector (DSS) to generate high-quality phase queries for the current video clip. These phase queries retrieve historical information from the proposed state space query (SSQ) module, which uses learnable tokens as the historical state space to preserve historical information. Extensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that B2Q-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy while achieving an inference speed of 106 fps. The B2Q-Net code is available at https://github.com/vsislab/B2Q-Net."

However, current 3D perception methods, especially specialized small models, exhibit poor generalization in open scenarios. On the other hand, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak 3D local spatial object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we develop LLMI3D, and propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better 3D spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We are the first to adapt an MLLM for image-based 3D perception. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by a large margin. We will publicly release our code, models, and dataset."

    "abstract": "While physical reservoir computers (PRCs) have tremendous potential for applications in electromechanical and biomechanical systems, their adoption remains slow due to a limited understanding of the impact of mechanical parameters on computational properties. Here, we specifically investigate these relationships concerning the body structure, input parameters, and observed states using classical swinging body dynamical systems: soft tentacles and a simulated multilink pendulum. Principally, we show that the mechanical structure (including stiffness and damping) couples with input parameters (frequency and magnitude) to regulate the manifested computational capabilities, and the type of PRC (if any) that can be achieved. Further, we show that input rate drives a transition between linear memory-based and nonlinear calculations, while the mechanical structure alters the conversion between longer and shorter memories. By investigating sensory limitations, we show that a spatiotemporal structure of the computational properties exists that relates to the mechanical structure, and that can be exploited to improve selected computing tasks in soft tentacle PRCs. Using the parameter dependencies we additionally provide inferences into the computational archetypes of the bodies of established soft robots."

However, mutual interference in dense traffic environments severely degrades their performance, increasing both missed detections and false alarms. This paper proposes a cognitive frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) automotive radar framework that employs a unified signal processing approach for suppressing both coherent and long-duration non-coherent interference. The method exploits a silent chirp, inserted between frames, to sense the electromagnetic environment. Interference parameters are estimated using the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). For coherent interference suppression, the radar adaptively adjusts its transmitted chirp rate to mitigate ghost targets. Non-coherent interference is suppressed using a two-stage strategy that combines iterative orthogonal projection with iterative soft-thresholding. Experimental validation with real-world radar data demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, particularly in mitigating challenging long-duration non-coherent interference."

In this study, conducted in collaboration with a media house, we investigate how multimodal AI systems (text+image) could be misused to create and promote misleading news content. Our aim is not to endorse such misuse, but to identify risks so that stronger safeguards can be developed. We simulate realistic scenarios where malicious actors generate deceptive news images using five variants of Stable Diffusion, including advanced models such as Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), across three well-known misinformation datasets: Snopes, Pheme, and Politifact. We evaluate how convincing these AI-generated images are by measuring their alignment with news text, and then assess whether GPT-4 can reliably classify and rank them compared to human judgment. Beyond testing risks, we also analyze whether generative AI behaves differently with legitimate (non-rumour) content. Our findings reveal both the power and the limitations of current AI in misinformation pipelines. Importantly, they highlight the need for stronger safeguards, transparent monitoring, and human oversight to prevent AI from amplifying false narratives. This work provides actionable insights for policymakers, media watchdogs, and developers working toward responsible AI deployment and the protection of information integrity in society."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had significant impact on the education sector, but its rapid adoption also creates challenges for academic integrity. Many students use generative AI to complete assignments, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated answers, particularly in the Indonesian language. Previous studies on AI-text classification have mainly focused on English or large-scale datasets, leaving a gap in research on Indonesian short-answer texts within real academic settings. This study addresses that gap by developing a classification model to differentiate human and generative AI responses in Indonesian quiz data. A dataset of 819 answers was collected from second-semester students of an IoT course and from several AI platforms (ChatGPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.0, Bing, and Perplexity). The data were processed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Three SVM kernels were evaluated: linear, radial basis function (RBF), and polynomial. The results show that the SVM with a linear kernel achieved the best balance between training and test performance, with a K-Fold accuracy of 0.9153 and a test accuracy of 0.9125. Although the RBF and polynomial kernels yielded higher K-Fold accuracies (0.9347 and 0.936), their test accuracy dropped to 0.8875, indicating overfitting. The findings highlight the novelty of applying classical machine learning methods to Indonesian academic text classification, providing a reliable baseline for future studies on detecting AI-generated answers in education."

The framework is proposed to integrate semantic web technologies with AI-driven data processing, which allows it to enable structured knowledge representation, support real-time data fusion, and permit adaptive (contextual) reasoning. Unlike prior work, this infrastructure uniquely combines semantic enrichment, federated governance, and explainable AI into a modular, cloud-native architecture, evaluated across smart city, energy, and health scenarios. A set of implementation scenarios stretches from urban policy planning to sustainable energy optimization and shows how this infrastructure can help build an ethical, efficient, and resilient decision ecosystem.

To address the limitations of existing range-compressed domain detection methods in terms of real data support and target signal integrity, this paper proposes a fast ship detection method in the range-compressed domain based on the ResNet-ID42 network. A Physics Informed Feature Enhancement (PIFE) module is first introduced to strengthen the discriminative representation of range-compressed domain data. Ship targets are then detected through slice-level classification, position localization, and boundary fusion, enabling rapid detection and complete target signal extraction without requiring full-scene imaging. Experimental results on the self-constructed real dataset WORCship-1.0 demonstrate that, under sparse target conditions in wide-area open-ocean scenes, the proposed method achieves a recall of 92.31% while reducing the overall processing time to only 48.1% of that required by representative object detection models. Moreover, more than 98% of non-target regions can be effectively excluded, significantly reducing the data volume for subsequent imaging and processing. Further validation using region-based imaging and image-domain detection shows that, compared with conventional full-scene imaging and detection pipelines, the overall processing efficiency is improved by approximately 14.1×. These results indicate that the proposed method achieves an effective balance among detection efficiency, target coverage capability, and signal integrity in wide-area large-scale oceanic scenarios, providing a practical and efficient solution for spaceborne SAR ship detection and onboard applications."

    "abstract": "Robust detection of underwater targets by passive sonar is hindered by weak tonal emissions masked by strong ambient noise in the marine environment. These narrowband components, represented as spectral lines in the LOFAR spectrum of received acoustic signals, are critical for target recognition but remain difficult to enhance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose a spectral enhancement framework that combines a frequency domain adaptive line enhancer (ALE) with a dual-attention guided wavelet domain fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm network (FISTA-Net). The ALE stage suppresses broadband noise while preserving spectral structures, whereas wavelet domain FISTA employs multiresolution analysis and attention-guided weighting to enhance weak spectral features under sparsity constraints. Experimental results show an average SNR improvement of 4.87 dB over block-processed sparsity- based on ALE and 6.37 dB over conventional ALE. To further study the recognition accuracy of the proposed method, a common ResNet based classifier is used. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving higher classification accuracy and demonstrating its effectiveness for underwater target detection and recognition."

However, visually comparing embeddings is challenging due to the difficulty of mentally aligning structures across views. In this paper, we address this challenge by constructing multiple hierarchies of data points from different perspectives to facilitate meaningful comparisons. We introduce Parallel Clusters (paraClus), a visual analytics system that enables multi-scale exploration of embedding structures. This is achieved through cluster formations across embeddings and attributes, along with an adaptive thresholding mechanism that defines neighborhoods. By dynamically adjusting this threshold, users can explore structures at varying scales. Our interface employs a parallel axes design, where clusters derived from the same embedding or attribute are aligned along individual axes. This layout allows users to easily compare neighboring clusters and observe relationships across embeddings. Furthermore, interactive subdivision mechanisms enable users to refine clusters based on their connections to other clusters, providing deeper insights into structural dependencies. Additionally, our system seamlessly integrates labels and scalar attributes into the clustering process, offering a unified approach to analyzing multi-attribute, time-varying, and network-derived embeddings. We evaluate the effectiveness of ParaClus through expert assessments and case studies."

    "abstract": "Driven by the new generation of information technology, modern manufacturing is shifting from traditional rigid production to flexible, customized models. This transformation imposes higher demands on systems' dynamic adaptability and real-time responsiveness. The emergence of Edge Computing (EC) and the Age of Information (AoI) offers promising solutions to these challenges. Significant progress has been made in areas such as edge resource allocation and information update strategies, contributing to enhanced system responsiveness. However, most existing studies assume task independence, which limits their applicability in complex scenarios (such as high-end manufacturing), where task dependency is dynamic and ubiquitous. In addition, ensuring end-to-end integration of sensing, transmission, computation, and control (STCC) remains a major challenge. To address this gap, this study proposes a collaborative framework focusing on sensing, transmission, computation, and control (STCC), centering around task chains. For the first time, it introduces and defines the Dependency-Aware Age of Information (DAoI) metric to quantify inter-task dependencies and the effects of delay propagation, thereby enabling a more accurate assessment of data timeliness. Additionally, an optimal controller using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is designed. Our model optimizes control performance and energy consumption through a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The proposed Dependency-Aware Heterogeneous Task and Resource Co-scheduling (MAPPO-DHTCO) algorithm efficiently manages task dependencies and resource allocation. Experimental results show that this method has significantly improved performance compared to the benchmark method."

    "abstract": "Gender detection from facial images plays a pivotal role in intelligent security, adaptive advertising, and demographic analytics. This paper presents an end-to-end gender detection system that combines face localization via MediaPipe-OpenCV with gender classification using a pre-trained Inception V3 Convolutional Neural Network refined through transfer learning and fine-tuning. A balanced dataset of 3,704 images sourced from the Kaggle Gender Classification Dataset and the Indonesian Muslim Student Face Dataset was reduced to 1,954 high-quality face crops (927 male and 1,027 female) after automatic face extraction. Images were pre-processed through cropping, resizing to 299 pixels, intensity normalization, and online augmentation (rotation, shear, zoom, horizontal flip). Hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout, batch size) were optimized via grid search across 36 configurations. The optimal model (batch 32, learning rate 1e-3, dropout 0.5) achieved 96.43 percent validation accuracy and 91.82 percent test accuracy, with F1-scores above 0.92 for both classes. Deployed in ONNX format, the model sustains 25 FPS on a consumer-grade CPU webcam stream, demonstrating robustness to moderate pose, illumination, and expression variations. These results indicate the feasibility of lightweight, real-time gender analytics for edge-based surveillance and context-aware digital signage."

    "abstract": "Analyzing sentiment in application reviews is essential for understanding user perceptions and improving system quality. This study introduces a hybrid sentiment classification model that combines Boosting Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (BWELM) with Random Forest in a stacked generalization framework. A dataset of 424 reviews of the SIAP UNDIP Student application, collected from the Google Play Store, was manually labeled and exhibited an imbalanced distribution between positive and negative sentiments. Preprocessing involved text cleansing, normalization, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and feature extraction using TF-IDF, followed by feature selection with Random Forest. In this framework, BWELM acts as the base classifier to generate probability outputs, which are then utilized as meta-features by Random Forest to improve classification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model achieved 75.78 % accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.81, outperforming ELM, WELM, and standalone BWELM. These findings highlight the hybrid model's superior ability to handle imbalanced data and complex textual features."

    "abstract": "Objective: This study proposes a novel sterilization strategy that integrates ultraviolet (UV) light, blue light (400 nm), and riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN) to achieve effective microbial inactivation while reducing UV energy usage and minimizing material degradation caused by prolonged UV exposure. Mechanistic analysis revealed that UV irradiation induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation, resulting in DNA damage, whereas blue light in combination with FMN generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which disrupt microbial cellular structures. However, blue light also activates CPD photolyase, facilitating CPD repair and thereby potentially diminishing sterilization efficacy. Importantly, the irradiation sequence was found to be critical: applying blue light prior to UV exposure (B→U) led to greater DNA destabilization, promoting higher CPD accumulation and enhanced microbial inactivation. This synergistic effect enabled a significant reduction in the required UV energy, which in turn delayed the aging of sterilized materials. The findings offer valuable insights into the design of advanced sterilization solutions for medical instruments, medical devices, and household products that incorporate materials typically susceptible to UV-induced aging and degradation, providing a balanced approach to sterilization efficacy and material preservation."

    "abstract": "A low-cost, low-profile, electronically controlled millimeter-wave antenna array with two-dimensional wide-angle beam scanning capability is presented. It consists of a planar waveguiding structure and a 1-bit transmitting surface. The waveguiding structure, which is composed of a power divider and a coupling cavity array, provides equal-amplitude in-phase energy output. And a receive-transmit element loaded with diodes is utilized to achieve 1-bit phase switching. More importantly, theoretical analysis and simulated results demonstrate that the parasitic beams of a 1-bit phased array can be eliminated by incorporating specific phase delays. Moreover, the sidelobe level is effectively reduced by optimizing these delays using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. In this design, substrate-integrated coaxial lines are integrated into the 1-bit element to implement specific phase delays. The effectiveness of this method has been thoroughly verified through both simulated and measured results. The final 16×16 antenna array successfully eliminates parasitic beams over the band from 25.5 to 28.5 GHz, and achieves a peak gain of 21.12dBi at 26.5 GHz. The design achieves a scanning range exceeding ±58° at 26.5 GHz in the φ = 0°, φ = 45°, and φ = 90° planes. Compared to existing digitally quantized antennas, this design enables 1-bit two-dimensional wide-angle beam scanning in the millimeter-wave band based on a planar antenna structure, demonstrating strong potential for millimeter-wave applications."

The system generates a pulse-width modulation (PWM) output, where the on-time is directly proportional to the angle of rotation. It consists of a sensor and an interfacing circuit. The sensor incorporates two pairs of planar inductor coils wrapped around the shaft, with a thin ferromagnetic material attached to a movable shaft inside the bobbin. As the shaft rotates, the inductance of each coil changes, enabling precise angle measurement. Unlike conventional planar coil-based angle sensors, the proposed system offers a linear output, overcoming nonlinearity issues. Additionally, it is immune to misalignment of the shaft and variations in the permeability of the ferromagnetic strip, addressing common challenges in angle sensing. The quasi-digital output eliminates the need for microcontrollers, analog to digital converters (ADCs), or virtual instruments, simplifying system integration.

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by blood entering the media layer of the aortic vessel wall. This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice."

Force estimation combines the physical models of hydraulic actuator and robot, as well as neural networks, to address nonlinearities and friction, relying on actuation-side sensing. Experiments show high-fidelity force estimation across three axes, with root-mean-square error reaching about 27, 23, and 80 mN for x, y, and z-axes, respectively. This approach, compared to existing robotic systems for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), eliminates the need for distal force sensors and complex integration at the instrument tip and offers lower system complexity and cost, while enabling reliable three-degree-of-freedom force sensing. It provides a practical and scalable solution for advanced force sensing in ESD and other endoluminal interventions."

To complement this analysis, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used from two representative vessels: a high-speed ferry completing 2,265 annual trips and a deep-sea container ship with multiple long-haul voyages. The operational data are processed to reconstruct propulsion energy demand and compare fuel requirements in terms of mass, volume, and range.

Consequently, researchers have increasingly focused on developing more general techniques, particularly for long-horizon and gentle manipulation, to enhance the manipulation ability and adaptability of robots. In this study, we propose a framework called VLM-Driven Atomic Skills with Diffusion Policy Distillation (VASK-DP), which integrates tactile sensing to enable gentle control of robotic arms in long-horizon tasks. The framework trains atomic manipulation skills through reinforcement learning in simulated environments. The Visual Language Model (VLM) interprets RGB observations and natural language instructions to select and sequence atomic skills, guiding task decomposition, skill switching, and execution. It also generates expert demonstration datasets that serve as the basis for imitation learning. Subsequently, compliant long-horizon manipulation policies are distilled from these demonstrations using diffusion-based imitation learning. We evaluate multiple control modes, distillation strategies, and decision frameworks. Quantitative results across diverse simulation environments and long-horizon tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, real robot deployment demonstrates successful task execution on physical hardware."

    "abstract": "Byzantine-robust Federated Learning (FL) enables service providers to learn an accurate global model, even when some participants may be malicious. Existing Byzantine-robust FL approaches primarily rely on the service provider conducting statistical analysis on clients' model updates, filtering out anomalous ones before aggregation to refine the global model. However, these defenses struggle to distinguish benign outliers from anomalous model updates under Byzantine attacks and heterogeneous settings, thereby harming model generalization ability. To address this issue, we propose a Byzantine-robust aggregation scheme based on hybrid anomaly detection (HadAGG) in heterogeneous FL. Specifically, we introduce a hybrid filtering strategy combining cosine similarity and Shapley values to distinguish between benign, malicious, and anomalous but benign model updates. To effectively identify benign outliers, we propose a Shapley value-based approach by constructing a multi-objective utility function that integrates the loss function and model accuracy to compute the Federated Shapley value, which measures client contributions. To achieve Byzantine-robust aggregation, we correct malicious model updates via gradient projection instead of directly discarding them, and employ a weighted aggregation to ensure that all model updates have a positive effect on model performance. Finally, we perform a theoretical analysis and a comprehensive evaluation for our scheme. Experimental results show that HadAGG outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) Byzantine-robust aggregation methods under different attack scenarios."

    "abstract": "The Indonesian National Health Insurance (JKN) program, managed by “BPJS Kesehatan”, aims to provide equitable and high-quality healthcare to all Indonesian citizens. Despite its widespread implementation, service time performance remains a major challenge in many healthcare facilities, often leading to delays and inefficiencies. This study focuses on analyzing the duration of service as a key performance indicator, specifically for patients diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Using a comparative process mining approach, this research applies two algorithms: Heuristic Miner and Inductive Miner. The models are evaluated using fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity metrics. The data set includes 120,625 outpatient event records related to CKD from “BPJS Kesehatan” between 2015 and 2018, covering ten high-volume provinces. The analysis reveals significant disparities in service times across provinces. East Java recorded the longest non-instantaneous activity duration (87.6 min), while Banten had the longest inter-activity delay (88.9 days). These values exceed the outpatient service time standards defined by Ministry of Health Regulation No. HK.01.07/MENKES/1634/2023. The findings offer actionable insights for improving healthcare workflows and reducing delays in outpatient CKD services under the JKN program."

Conventional diffusion adaptive filters often lack robustness in such challenging environments and fail to incorporate structural constraints, limiting their practical effectiveness. This paper proposes a widely-linear diffusion constrained complex Gaussian mixture model (WL-DCGMM) algorithm. The parameters of the proposed algorithm are optimized by a dedicated expectation- maximization (EM) approach derived for the complex Gaussian mixture model (CGMM). Theoretical analysis establishes the convergence and steady-state performance of the designed algorithm under linear constraint. Extensive simulations across diverse noise distributions with linear constraint demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy of the designed method, particularly in scenarios where traditional approaches falter, and confirm the validity of the theoretical performance evaluation."

    "abstract": "To achieve ultra-high precision positioning, the extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA), consisting of hundreds or even thousands of antenna elements, has garnered significant attention. However, due to increased antenna aperture, it inevitably encounters both near-field effects and spatial non-stationarity effects. In the near-field region, the traditional assumption of far-field plane wavefront no longer holds, necessitating consideration of spherical wave characteristics. Spatial non-stationarity arises when signals fail to reach the entire array, but instead only impinge on a subset of antennas, which is referred to as the signal’s visible region (VR). Both effects cause model mismatch and therefore reduce positioning accuracy. In this paper, we introduce an exact near-field signal model in the context of ELAA. Based on this model, we prove that the steering vectors of source signals and the eigenvectors of the signal subspace become collinear as the number of antennas approaches infinity, which makes it easier to estimate the VR and source location parameters. Accordingly, we develop an estimation method to effectively extract the VR information of signals even when the VRs are discontinuous or overlapping. After obtaining the VR information, we propose three source localization methods that leverage the estimated VR and eigenvectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve high-precision localization while reducing computational complexity, thereby overcoming the model mismatch induced by near-field effects and spatial non-stationarity effects in ELAA."

    "abstract": "Vortex electromagnetic waves carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) enable differentiated scaling of multiple targets within the beam coverage, granting them superior theoretical performance in multi-dimensional multi-target staring imaging. Owing to the approximate dual relationship between OAM modes and target azimuth angles, multi-mode vortex scanning can rapidly and accurately determine spatial azimuth information of targets, significantly enhancing radar imaging resolution and speed in the azimuthal dimension. Recently, multiple factors, including insufficient OAM mode diversity, complex noise environments and low mode purity, collectively hinder the practical implementation of existing vortex imaging algorithms for high-resolution OAM based radar systems. To address these challenges, this article proposes a high-resolution RELAX algorithm for vortex imaging technology based on precise analysis of echo signal components. The method treats echo signals as superpositions of multiple complex sinusoidal signals and achieves accurate extraction of target positional information through iterative refinement. A comparative analysis of spectral estimation methods, sparse recovery methods and the RELAX method is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to conventional imaging algorithms, the RELAX algorithm exhibits superior target recovery capability, effectively suppresses spurious targets, mitigates noise interference, and significantly improves image resolution, which is particularly pronounced under limited OAM mode diversity. The experimental findings reveal that under with the OAM modes of [-7,7], the RELAX algorithm achieves a limiting resolution of 6.7cm×19°, with the normalized mean-square error of 0.4557 and the image correlation value of 0.6917. This approach substantially alleviates the inherent dependence on OAM mode quantity in vortex radar systems, providing a robust resolution for practical scenarios with constrained electromagnetic (EM) resources. The proposed method notably expands the application scope of vortex EM waves in radar imaging architectures, establishes a solid new technical pathway for vortex radar signal processing, and facilitates the practical deployment of vortex radar."

Therefore, we propose a UAV-based computation offloading model to maximize the throughput of terrestrial users while reducing the privacy overhead. Based on an on-board battery energy harvesting technologies, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization method to optimize the CPU cycle frequency and offloading decisions that further extend the UAV execution time. Then present a federated learning-based privacy protection framework to generate the optimal block size. In addition, we demonstrate the long-term energy queue constraint through massive mathematical derivations. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance gains in terms of throughput and privacy protection overhead compared to some advanced benchmarks."

Many such applications require limited operational lifetimes, making biodegradable transient sensors a promising route toward sustainable, eco-friendly systems. In this work, we present a humidity sensor in which the chitosan-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) substrate not only provides mechanical support but also serves as the sensing layer with MXene as conducting interdigitated electrodes. The film dissolves completely in water within one day, enabling transient operation, while the MXene-based electrodes can be recovered and reused. The sensor exhibits a clear response to relative humidity in the range of 18-68% Relative Humidity (RH), with a sensitivity of 528% at 68% RH. Additionally, breath monitoring experiments demonstrate its potential for biosensing applications. Biodegradability tests confirm complete degradation of the substrate in soil, water, and acidified water, along with successful recycling of the MXene electrodes. This study demonstrates a sustainable strategy for transient, recyclable, and eco-friendly humidity sensors with practical applications in smart and green electronics."

Our proposed system enables a remote user wearing a VR headset to independently navigate the local environment through a drone while guiding a local AR headset user. The drone represents the remote user physically and virtually with an AR avatar. The system provides the remote user with a 3D reconstruction of the local environment, the local user's avatar, and real-time drone camera video to facilitate drone operation and collaboration. A user study comparing our drone-enhanced MR system with 2D video and 360-degree video MR systems during inspection tasks revealed that the telepresence drone significantly improved collaboration efficiency and enhanced users' social presence and spatial presence. However, the remote users perceived a higher workload. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of independent spatial navigation through drones in remote collaboration and offer insights for future drone-enhanced MR remote collaboration systems."

Accurate measurement and quantification of anatomical structures in PLAX view is essential for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cardiac diseases. Yet, manual measurement is limited by its time-consuming nature and susceptibility to inter-individual variability and image quality fluctuations. Automated keypoint detection of anatomical structures using deep learning offers a robust solution, potentially assisting physicians in the precise measurement of parameters within specified views. A systematic comparison of various deep learning models and keypoint representations is conducted in this paper for keypoint detection within the PLAX view, with the aim of exploring the best models and representations. Three datasets, comprising 442 patients and including data from end-diastole, mid-systole, and end-systole, are constructed to fully evaluate the accuracy and generalizability of different deep learning methods. In the 12-keypoint detection task conducted on the end-diastole dataset, the HRNet-Heatmap method achieved the highest success detection rate (SDR) of 68.77% and the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 mm among the evaluated approaches. For the 2-keypoint detection task on the mid-systole dataset, the HRFormer-Heatmap method performed the best, with an SDR of 89.09% and an MAE of 1.90 mm. In the 2-keypoint detection task on the end-systole dataset, the CSPNeXt-SimCC method demonstrated the best performance, achieving an SDR of 94.46% and an MAE of 2.95 mm."

    "abstract": "The control of household devices relies heavily on physical interaction, with its high frame rate, lower latency, and real-time response to user operations. With the increasing number of artificial-intelligence (AI) models being used in smart home control systems (SCSs), there are two problems that limit the application of SCS: 1) AI models usually need to be processed in the cloud, which leads to high communication latency with smart home devices, and 2) the running of AI models on edge devices is usually limited by insufficient computational power. To address the problems, a pose estimation-based SCS (PE-SCS) is investigated in this study. First, a logic-based action judgment method with visual feedback is proposed to comprehensively judge the PE of consecutive frames and the response of the visual interface so that the action signal of SCS is under control. Then, an optimization method called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OM-HCIoPE</i> is proposed to reduce the dependence on model output through parallel prediction in order to improve the reliability and the performance of the system. A series of experimental evaluations shows that the proposed method achieves a higher frame rate, lower latency, and real-time response to user operations, which provides a user-friendly experience for a wide range of audiences."

    "abstract": "Recently, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) has been widely utilized in various research domains. This is particularly evident in application fields, where SHAP analysis serves as a crucial tool for identifying biomarkers and assisting in result validation. However, despite its frequent usage, SHAP is often not applied in a manner that maximizes its potential contributions. A review of recent papers employing SHAP reveals that many studies subjectively select a limited number of features as ’important’ and analyze SHAP values by approximately observing plots without assessing statistical significance. Such superficial application may hinder meaningful contributions to the applied fields. To address this, we propose a library package designed to simplify the interpretation of SHAP values. By simply inputting the original data and SHAP values, our library provides: 1) the number of important features to analyze, 2) the pattern of each feature via univariate analysis, and 3) the interaction between features. All information is extracted based on its statistical significance and presented in simple, comprehensible sentences, enabling users of all levels to understand the interpretations. We hope this library fosters a comprehensive understanding of statistically valid SHAP results."

    "abstract": "At present, most existing methods for suppressing voltage oscillations induced by constant power loads (CPLs) in bipolar DC distribution systems (Bi-DCDSs) only focus on control frameworks, while the evaluation of the CPL power demand boundary defined by control parameters for ensuring system stability remains unexplored. To help tuning the control parameters, this paper proposes a boundary evaluation method to support control parameter tuning and thereby ensure the stability of Bi-DCDSs. The methods for suppressing voltage oscillations discussed in this paper include: the virtual impedance control (VIC) method based on the positive and negative port components, and the VIC method based on the DC symmetrical components. Firstly, the source impedance models and load admittance models of the Bi-DCDS controlled by the two VIC methods are established. Based on these established models, the input-output gain matrices of the Bi-DCDS are derived, providing foundation for stability analysis. Using the Generalized Nyquist Criterion, the stability of a Bi-DCDS with specified parameters can be assessed. By exploring the stability of the Bi-DCDS under different CPL power demands, the boundary can be identified. The case study demonstrates that, for a ±375 V system, the evaluation results obtained by the proposed method deviate from the simulation-identified boundary by less than 2 kW, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) schemes are effective approaches for parallel converters to increase switching frequency, efficiency, and power density. However, existing ZVS methods based on variable switching frequency control face either a wide switching frequency range or excessive current ripples, resulting in high current stress and suboptimal efficiency. To address this issue, this article proposes a variable switching frequency phase shift pulse width modulation (VSF-PSPWM) for parallel converters. All switches operate in critical ZVS regions, thereby eliminating unnecessary current ripple. In the proposed VSF-PSPWM, the switching frequencies of three pairs of interleaved triangular carriers with 180° phase difference are first synchronized and varied to shape the half-bridge (HB) currents into quadrilateral waveforms, creating sufficient ZVS conditions for all switches. Then, in over-ZVS regions, the 180° is switched to a derived optimal phase shift angle to reduce the unnecessary current ripples. Meanwhile, the initial values of the carriers within each carrier cycle are modified to achieve positive and negative peak symmetry of the quadrilateral circulating current. Finally, experiments are conducted on a two-parallel SiC converter prototype to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this work, we propose a multivector predictive encoderless control technique with high-frequency injection, achieving low-speed range operation requiring no encoder. Moreover, to eliminate the signal distortion caused by coherent demodulation, a time-domain demodulator based on the stationary reference frame is introduced. The effectiveness of this approach has been validated by experimental results."

To address this fundamental measurement challenge, we propose a novel reconstruction framework designed to enhance the reliability of TSC quantification. Our method, termed MC-WSNM-GRPCA, models the multi-dimensional ²³Na MRI data by integrating multi-channel weighted nuclear norm minimization with generalized robust principal component analysis. This model-based denoising approach leverages inter-slice noise variations and flexible low-rank approximations to robustly separate the low-energy ²³Na signal from noise components in the image domain. We evaluated the framework using simulated data corrupted by various noise types, including Gaussian, Rician, and acquisition noise, and in vivo data from glioma patients, acquired with a 32-channel ²³Na/¹H head coil. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrated superior performance in both noise suppression and preservation of underlying signal fidelity, as evaluated by quantitative metrics and visual quality. In conclusion, the proposed model-based reconstruction framework effectively improves the precision of TSC quantification from low-SNR ²³Na MRI data. This work provides a promising solution for enhancing the clinical value of quantitative sodium imaging in applications such as early diagnosis of brain tumors and stroke."

    "abstract": "The quality of sonar images is crucial for underwater perception and interpretation. However, due to the low resolution, weak separability, and strong interference characteristics of sonar data, improving the quality of sonar images has always been a highly challenging task. Existing super-resolution technologies, such as Real-ESRGAN, although they show certain effects in image reconstruction, still fail to meet the strict requirements for sonar image processing. They often lead to artifacts and over-smoothing in the reconstructed images, which degrade image fidelity and limit further analysis. Aiming at the limitations of Real-ESRGAN in reconstructing underwater sonar images, this letter proposes a sonar image reconstruction method based on enhanced Real-ESRGAN. During the sonar image reconstruction process, this method employs a noise reduction treatment that combines deep learning-based non-local means filtering with adaptive wavelet transformation. This effectively reduces artifacts caused by aliasing effects. Moreover, the CoordGate module is introduced into the backbone network Residual in Residual Dense Block Network (RRDBNet) of Real-ESRGAN, significantly enhancing the model's feature modulation capability. Experimental results indicate that this method performs excellently in sonar image reconstruction, particularly in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), producing visually sharper and structurally more consistent results compared to the baseline method."

To date, most existing panic behavior recognition models still fail to detect crowd panic quickly enough to guide timely pedestrian-control measures. To address this gap, we propose the pedestrian Panic Behavior Recognition Model (PBRM), which integrates audio-semantic signals, speech-derived panic keywords, 21-keypoint kinematic patterns associated with running and falls, and multi-inflection pedestrian trajectories. These heterogeneous cues are consolidated through a lightweight fusion mechanism—efficient enough for real-time execution on edge devices—to generate a unified panic score, thereby providing operators with a rapid and reliable basis for crowd-control decisions. Evaluated on the four-hour Hongqiao-Panic dataset collected at Hongqiao Railway Station, PBRM achieves 84.2% precision, 85.7% recall, 84.9% F1, and 1.18 s average alert lead, improving the best single-modality baseline by 3.0 pp F1 while keeping the false-alarm rate (FAR) below 8%. Ablation study shows that audio-semantic channels dominate early cues, where as posture-trajectory streams reinforce decision robustness under occlusion. These results demonstrate that PBRM can be deployed on edge devices to provide operators with a critical lead time for crowd-control interventions, advancing intelligent transportation safety from post-event surveillance to proactive prevention."

The results showed that YOLOv8 was significantly better than MobileNetV2 and VGG19, achieving an accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 3 \\%}$</tex> compared to their <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 9 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 5 \\%}$</tex>. YOLOv8's integrated preprocessing and optimized design made it better at classifying, while MobileNetV2 and VGG19 seemed to overfit the data. These findings really show how effective YOLOv8 is for BISINDO recognition and offer important insights for future efforts to improve SLR technology for sign languages that don't have many resources. Our findings provide a critical baseline for BISINDO sign language recognition and offer strong evidence for the effectiveness of modern, real-time architectures in resource-constrained scenarios, addressing a significant gap in assistive technology for the Indonesian Deaf community."

    "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offer significant potential for mechanical energy harvesting, but their development is constrained by the trade-off between high charge trapping capability and adequate electrical conductivity, which limits energy conversion efficiency. To tackle this issue, a dual-modification strategy involving the incorporation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was developed. PTFE was introduced to enhance charge trapping through its strong electron affinity, while MWCNTs formed a conductive network to facilitate rapid charge transport. Under optimized doping concentrations of 5 wt.% PTFE and 0.25 wt.% MWCNTs, the composite exhibited substantial performance enhancements, with open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and transferred charge increased by 294.43%, 521.0%, and 252.55%, respectively, compared to pure PDMS. A peak power density of 8.37 W/m² was achieved under a 20 MΩ load. The composite membrane exhibited a tensile strength of 4.21 ± 0.42 MPa, elastic modulus of 1.45 ± 0.07 MPa, and elongation at break of 169.80 ± 18.69%. The device displayed excellent thermal stability (20-100 °C) and slight UV-enhanced output, despite degradation at high humidity, it successfully retained 70.76% of its initial voltage at moderate humidity levels (55-65% RH). It maintained stable electrical output after 5000 seconds of continuous operation under mechanical stress, and generated clear voltage signals during various human motions such as walking, running, and jumping. Additionally, our motion recognition model based on deep learning techniques attained a high accuracy of 99.95%, demonstrating its effectiveness in action classification tasks. Combined with a UI visualization interface, it enabled the assessment of motion energy consumption. This study demonstrates an effective material design strategy for improving TENG performance and provides valuable insights for the advancement of high-efficiency wearable energy harvesting and information fusion systems."

    "abstract": "Numerous existing deep learning models for time-series classification (TSC) tend to overlook the intricate interplay between higher-and lower-level semantic information. While the focus is often on extracting higher-level semantics from lower-level sources, the reciprocal influence of lower-level information on higher levels is undervalued. To address this, we propose an ensemble transitive bidirectional decoupled self-distillation (ETBiDecSD) method for TSC. ETBiDecSD enhances the robustness of higher-level semantic information using an average feature ensemble (AFE) method to amalgamate the output from each level. Simultaneously, the integrated features are transmitted to each lower level through a directional decoupled distillation (DD) structure. Additionally, to promote deep interaction between higher-and lower-level semantic information, ETBiDecSD introduces a transitive bidirectional DD (TBDD) structure, facilitating the transfer of target-class and nontarget-class knowledge between higher and lower levels. Experimental results demonstrate that whether a fully convolutional network (FCN) with four convolutional blocks or InceptionTime with four Inception blocks is used as the baseline, ETBiDecSD outperforms a quantity of well-established self-distillation algorithms across 85 widely used UCR2018 datasets, as evidenced by the metrics “win”/“tie”/“lose” and avg. rank, which are derived from accuracy and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-scores.

    "abstract": "This study investigates a multi-level supply chain subject to cap-and-trade regulation, involving a capital-constrained supplier, a manufacturer, and a retailer. Blockchain technology enhances trust among core firms, cross-level firms, and banks, thereby enabling financing for cross-level firms, and strengthening consumer trust in low-carbon products. This study explores the advance payment without blockchain technology (AN mode), and two blockchain-enabled financing modes: advance payment with cross-level financing (ACB mode) and advance payment with bank financing (ABB mode). First, both ABB and ACB modes reduce carbon emissions more than the AN mode, while which mode achieves greater total supply chain abatement depends on the bank interest rate and carbon abatement efficiency. Blockchain-enabled financing benefits all supply chain participants when blockchain operation costs are low, achieving win–win–win outcomes compared with the AN mode. These results remain robust even when carbon abatement efficiencies are heterogeneous. Second, when all supply chain participants adopt blockchain, an equilibrium emerges where the supplier, manufacturer, and retailer choose the same financing mode. Interestingly, when blockchain operation costs are low and carbon abatement efficiency is high, the ACB mode enables all participants to attain higher profits. Finally, when the supplier's initial capital and the retailer's interest rate are either low or high, the ACB mode is the supplier's optimal choice under blockchain technology. These findings provide managerial guidance for strategically selecting financing modes and adopting blockchain technology. The reliability of the conclusions is verified through sensitivity analyses."

The modulation effect of various rotors on BDFIM performance is directly reflected in the magductance parameter. The modulation effects of the SCC modulator on magnetomotive force (MMF) amplitude and phase are revealed and quantitatively expressed by the magnetic field conversion factor and phase shift. The impacts of various modulator parameters are investigated, and recommendations for their selection are summarized. Based on this, an improved rotor is proposed. Finally, two prototypes are manufactured, and the proposed rotor is validated through analytical calculations and comparisons with existing optimum rotors by finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results."

The fiber laser is composed of an erbium-doped fiber (EDF), a fiber Bragg grating (FBG), and a plane mirror. To transduce the external current variations, a YIG probe is strategically employed within the resonant cavity, proximal to the planar mirror, where the magnetic-optical phase shift caused by current variations modifies the phase difference between two orthogonal light waves, resulting in a shift in the polarization mode beat frequency (PMBF) produced by orthogonally polarized light, which exhibits a direct and measurable correlation to the variations in the current. Especially, a biased magnetic field to the YIG probe resolves the nonlinearity problem. The experimental results demonstrate that when a pre-biased magnetic field of 15 mT is applied to the YIG, the system exhibits sensitivities of 405.36 kHz/A at 11.125 MHz and 392.86 kHz/A at 796.3 MHz, with corresponding R-squared values of 0.99963 and 0.99802, respectively. Furthermore, the maximum sensitivity is increased to 661.1 kHz/A by lowering intrinsic polarization to 3.44 MHz. It provides a reliable new option for the upgrading of current detection technology in related fields."

    "abstract": "Cyberbullying has emerged as a serious problem in online interactions, particularly on social media platforms, due to its potential to inflict long-term psychological and emotional harm on victims. The high volume, informal language, and unstructured nature of social media comments make automated detection a challenging task. This research proposes a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, integrated with FastText word embedding, to classify cyberbullying-related comments in the Indonesian language. CNN is employed to extract local textual features, while BiLSTM captures bidirectional sequential dependencies, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of context. FastText embedding is used to handle out-of-vocabulary terms, spelling variations, and morphological complexities in informal Indonesian text. Experiments were conducted using a benchmark dataset, comparing CNN, BiLSTM, and CNN–BiLSTM architectures with three different embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. The results demonstrate that the CNN–BiLSTM model with FastText embedding achieved the best performance, obtaining an accuracy of 92.4 %, an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F 1$</tex>-score of 92.38 %, and an AUC of 96.04 %, surpassing other model-embedding configurations.

    "abstract": "Analyzing individual feed intake is essential for improving production efficiency in livestock systems. However, heterogeneity across testing sites, derived from differences in weight, diet, behavior, and environmental conditions, limits the effectiveness of global federated models. This work proposes a federated learning architecture based on biological clustering to improve the modeling of individual feed intake by reducing variability between nodes and enhancing the stability and convergence of distributed training. This study used real data from six trials with automated feeders measuring individual consumption. Animals from each trial were grouped into three homogeneous clusters using k-means, based on initial weight, average intake, and intake rate. Each cluster trained a local autoencoder model, which was then federated using FedAvg weighted by cluster size. The results show that the clustering approach reduces the reconstruction error by 93.4% compared to local training and by 13.2% compared to per-trial federation, while also achieving a 25% reduction in parameter variance. Three-fold federated cross-validation confirms the model's generalization capability, with an average error of 0.34 on unseen data. These results demonstrate that the use of biological clustering and weighted aggregation in federated learning improves the stability and effectiveness of the models in heterogeneous livestock contexts."

This study proposes a novel approach for multi-seizure classification leveraging transformer-based attention models combined with pseudo-labelling techniques. The proposed architecture integrates a Transformer model with self-attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies and intricate patterns within EEG sequences. The research utilizes the Temple University EEG Corpus, which contains over 30,000 EEG recordings from approximately 315 subjects. Among them clinically relevant subset representing four major seizure types is extracted and analyzed. Experimental results indicate that the model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.2% on the test dataset. Comparative analysis with traditional models demonstrated a significant improvement of up to 10% in classification accuracy and a reduction in false positives by 15%. Cross-validation further verified the stability of the model, with an average cross-validated accuracy of 98.7% and a standard deviation of 0.5%, confirming minimal overfitting. This research introduces an advanced deep learning pipeline capable of transforming the scenario of seizure detection in EEG analysis by offering state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability. Future work may explore real-time deployment and expansion to more diverse EEG datasets to further validate the model’s efficacy."

    "abstract": "Over-the-air (OTA) updates are becoming a standard practice for upgrading Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) software, allowing software systems to be modified through a wireless network. They are beneficial in several contexts. For example, in the automotive domain, OTA updates enable manufacturers to update vehicle software without physical access. However, the considerable number of products (e.g., vehicles within the fleet) and frequent changes and updates to software components can generate many software configurations that are impossible to analyze beforehand without any automated support. This problem hampers the verification of the system’s safety. This paper proposes a contract-driven framework for reasoning about the safety of OTA updates. Our framework supports (a) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">contract composition</i>, which enables reasoning about the behavior composition of different software components, and (b) verification of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">component substitutability</i>, which allows checking if the software component deployed by an OTA update can replace another component without generating any safety breach.We rigorously define our framework and formally prove that if the OTA update ensures the satisfaction of its contract, the system (safety) properties are preserved. We propose an instance of our solution that targets CPS designed with Simulink<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup> System Composer, a widely used tool for modeling the different components of the system architecture and their interaction. We propose using Simulink<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup> Requirements Tables to express the contracts of CPS components, as they enable engineers to model the system requirements using pre/post-conditions within their Simulink<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">®</sup> models. We implemented our solution as a software prototype that extends THEANO, a tool that enables engineers to verify the consistency and completeness of Requirements Tables. We evaluated our solution by considering the Ten Lockheed Martin Cyber-Physical Problems. We defined 20 OTA updates and effectively identified issues in 9 of them. We analyzed and fixed the problems, inspecting each unsafe OTA update to understand the causes of the safety breaches. After fixing the problems, THEANO confirmed the safety of all OTA updates. THEANO required less than a minute to analyze each OTA update, making it practical for industrial applications."

Purpose: To develop an Industry 4.0 ready IoT-enabled, AI-assisted, point-of-care impedance tomography based jacket featuring wireless connectivity (wIT) for dynamic monitoring the human lung functions via an android smartphone interface and clinically evaluate its diagnostic performance against standard PFT modalities. Methods: A total of forty-six individuals (23 control and 23 patients) were included in this study, registered under the clinical trial registry of India, and two involved IHEC Committees. Standard pulmonary physiological parameters, including primary lung volumes (Functional Residual Capacity, Inspiratory Capacity, Total Lung Capacity, and Residual Volume), as well as secondary volumes (Expiratory Reserve Volume and Vital Capacity), were obtained from Plethysmography, Spirometry, and the wIT jacket. The wIT measurements were recorded simultaneously with these PFT, and results obtained by AI trained model were statistically compared to assess correlation and diagnostic performance. Results: The wIT system achieved a sensitivity of 78%, a specificity of 86%, a positive predictive value of 86%, and a negative predictive value of 80%, as derived from the confusion matrix. In comparison, the corresponding values for spirometry were 23%, 90%, 22%, and 91%, and for plethysmography were 95.2%, 81.7%, 66.4%, and 97.8%. Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.6547 further confirmed the classification reliability of the wIT jacket. Conclusion: The developed wIT system exhibited the ability to reliably classify subjects as healthy or not healthy. It established agreement with body plethysmography measurements. A frequency-based imaging biomarker for wIT is developed. The study demonstrated devices’ potential that may be used as a non-invasive: (a) point-of-care device in non-clinical environment and/or (b) add-on with existing gold standard clinical setups, for pulmonary assessment and long-term respiratory monitoring."

However, traditional meta-heuristic and artificial intelligence-based planning methods face significant challenges due to the intricate interplay between indoor environments (IEs) and IWN demands. In this article, we present an indoor wireless network Planning with large LANguage models (iPLAN) framework, which integrates multi-modal IE representations into large language model (LLM)-powered optimizers to improve IWN planning. First, we instate the role of LLMs as optimizers, outlining embedding techniques for IEs, and introducing two core applications of iPLAN: (i) IWN planning based on pre-existing IEs and (ii) joint design of IWN and IE for new wireless-friendly buildings. For the former, we embed essential information into LLM optimizers by leveraging indoor descriptions, domain-specific knowledge, and performance-driven perception. For the latter, we conceptualize a multi-agent strategy, where intelligent agents collaboratively address key planning sub-tasks in a step-by-step manner while ensuring optimal trade-offs between the agents. The simulation results demonstrate that iPLAN achieves superior performance in IWN planning tasks and optimizes building wireless performance through the joint design of IEs and IWNs, exemplifying a paradigm shift in IWN planning."

It plays an essential role in various applications such as Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving and robotics.

Due to its efficiency and effectiveness, MVS has become a pivotal method for image-based 3D reconstruction. Recently, with the success of deep learning, many learning-based MVS methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance against traditional methods. We categorize these learning-based methods as: depth map-based, voxel-based, NeRF-based, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based, and large feed-forward methods. Among these, we focus significantly on depth map-based methods, which are the main family of MVS due to their conciseness, flexibility and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing. We investigate these learning-based methods, summarize their performances on popular benchmarks, and discuss promising future research directions in this area."

This strategy not only considers the tight coupling interactions of energy, workload and water flow to meet dynamic service requirements of DCs, but also can co-optimize the investment decisions related to electricity and water delivery network expansions to mitigate long-term siting risks. Moreover, a temperature-aware power and water demand model is proposed to enhance operational flexibility in DC expansion planning, and a modified thermodynamic formulation of DCs is formulated to explore the interdependencies between electricity and cooling water demands of DCs on ambient temperature fluctuations by integrating a variable resistor. To address the fact that higher computing capacities of DCs will attract more workloads, a stochastic-robust programming approach is employed, which considers both decision-independent uncertainties from renewable generation, electricity load and water consumption, as well as demand-induced uncertainties related to investment behaviors. Furthermore, a Parametric Column-and-Constraint Generation (PC&CG) algorithm with multiple linearization techniques is presented to alleviate the computational complexity of the original DC planning problem and quantitatively assess demand-driven workload uncertainties. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving an economical investment portfolio of sustainable DCs."

    "abstract": "The design of automated driving systems is of growing industry and societal interest. Perception is a critical technology for these systems, which allows a vehicle to discern the surrounding environment. Perception systems in automated vehicles frequently use machine vision algorithms; however, the performance of a machine vision algorithm critically depends on the quality of the data provided. Quantifying the ‘quality’ of image data is therefore potentially a useful tool in understanding and predicting the performance of a machine vision system. This study uses the Shannon Information Capacity, a metric based on information theory, to evaluate the impact of image quality on a perception algorithm. In this preliminary study, a set of synthetic objects are arranged to create a novel simulated test chart. The chart contains standard machine vision objects of interest (people and cars) as well as a slanted edge, which is used to calculate image quality metrics. The chart is degraded using varying levels of contrast and blur to simulate different real-world operating conditions. Object detection performance is then evaluated using a range of deep learning-based detection algorithms, with different architectures. The results indicate that Shannon Information Capacity has the potential to predict machine vision performance across multiple model architectures and object types. For example, the results for all the models show that accuracy remains relatively constant above an SIC value of 0.25 b/p. Results indicate that for YOLOv10m SIC has mutual information value with detection accuracy of 1.66 bits while MTF50 has a score of 0.4945 bits. This study is the first to show the correlation between SIC and machine vision performance. While other metrics have been previously shown to have some correlation with machine vision, the correlation shown by SIC is much stronger. The findings presented may be of use to designers of autonomous driving systems and automotive camera manufacturers."

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel approach for motion planning and control in quadruped robots that simultaneously optimizes the base trajectory and contact sequence along the longitudinal direction. The method relies on a simplified 2-D single rigid body model to compute an optimal trajectory, which is then mapped at the joint level. To compensate for model approximations and environmental uncertainties, we introduce an iterative learning control (ILC) scheme that progressively improves tracking performance across repetitions. Compared to existing approaches, our formulation unifies contact planning and trajectory optimization in a learning-while-doing framework, enhancing robustness to disturbances. We validate the method on the quadruped robot Solo-12, demonstrating adaptive gait generation and stable locomotion across different terrains and perturbations."

    "abstract": "Portable volumetric video capturing systems present a compelling alternative to traditional, bulky prototype systems used for streaming and interacting with volumetric content. Their key advantages, particularly flexibility and ease of deployment, make them suitable for a wide range of applications. However, despite their potential, there has been limited exploration into the design of such portable systems. This paper addresses this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of portability and proposing an optimized camera array configuration tailored for high-quality volumetric content generation. Our approach begins with a novel, flexible camera calibration method that leverages geometric priors, enabling accurate alignment of multiple cameras without requiring specialized expertise. Building on this, we introduce a meticulous fusion technique that integrates captured and inferred data to reconstruct complete volumetric representations. This method achieves a fusion latency of less than 100 ms, ensuring real-time performance. We integrate these innovations into a portable capturing system, named PortaCap, which incorporates a carefully designed camera deployment strategy. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, PortaCap demonstrates significant improvements in volumetric content quality, achieving enhancements ranging from 13% to 33.8%. These results underscore the system's potential to advance the state-of-the-art in portable volumetric video capture."

    "abstract": "Human-portable high-resolution millimeter-wave synthetic aperture radar (HR-mmW-SAR) enables effective imaging in confined or dynamic environments, with promising applications in search and rescue, security screening, and infrastructure inspection. However, the imaging performance of such systems is highly susceptible to motion-induced phase errors, as even slight manual perturbations can severely degrade image quality. Conventional motion compensation approaches typically rely on inertial navigation systems or inertial measurement units, which increase hardware complexity and cost. To address these limitations while preserving system simplicity and portability, this study presents the first demonstration of motion-sensor-free autofocus imaging in a human-portable HR-mmW-SAR system, enabled by a minimum entropy autofocus back-projection (MEA-BP) algorithm. The method estimates and corrects motion trajectory errors without the need for external motion sensors, by minimising image entropy through a coordinate descent strategy combined with efficient image-difference-guided updates. In contrast to existing autofocus methods developed for airborne SAR or those dependent on auxiliary sensors, MEA-BP directly addresses the unpredictable motion patterns associated with manually operated SAR platforms. Extensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments demonstrate that MEA-BP significantly improves image sharpness and suppresses motion-induced artefacts under practical use cases involving mild hand-induced perturbations. Furthermore, the algorithm maintains partial effectiveness under more challenging conditions, including abrupt motion stops in low signal-to-noise environments and short-duration rapid movements. These results confirm the robustness of the proposed method and establish its feasibility for compact, cost-sensitive, mobile SAR systems operating in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of wind turbine blade icing is essential for ensuring the safety and efficiency of wind farm operations. Although current machine learning and deep learning approaches are capable of identifying icing states, they still suffer from three major limitations: heavy reliance on manual feature engineering limits the capture of meaningful spatiotemporal dependencies; highly imbalanced data leads to increased false negatives and alarm delays; and sensitivity to data noise often introduces false positives. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an imbalance- and noise-resistant TG-Diff network, which achieves accurate and robust icing state classification by effectively integrating spatiotemporal information from multiple sensors. The TG-Diff comprises three core modules: a Temporal Filtering-based Graph Learning Module (TF-GLM), a Temporal-Spatial Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (TSD-GCN), and a Distance-Based Classifier (DBC). Specifically, the TF-GLM dynamically infers node relationships to construct robust graph topologies; the TSD-GCN enhances feature representation and suppresses noise through diffusion mechanisms; and the DBC effectively mitigates class imbalance by leveraging distance-based decision boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modules work synergistically to collectively enhance the accuracy and robustness of icing detection in real-world complex environments."

The three-stage stepped-impedance folded helical arm effectively enhance the bandwidth while maintaining a wide HPBW, and the arc-shaped metal ring further broadens the 3-dB ARBW across the wide band. To validate, a prototype was fabricated and measured. Measurements show that the bandwidths corresponding to 10-dB return loss and 3-dB AR reach 44.2% and 35.2%, respectively. Moreover, within a 17.4% bandwidth, the measured HPBW and 3-dB ARBW vary from 132° to 152° and 179° to 265°, respectively, demonstrating its suitability for wideband circularly polarized applications with broad beam coverage and robust AR performance."

    "abstract": "Permafrost carbon pool stability is threatened by climate warming. Challenges in evaluating the carbon storage potential of boreal montane forest permafrost regions include the lack of understanding of the control mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks change and of timely, spatially explicit estimates. The SOC stocks in typical montane forests within the permafrost regions of Northeast China were investigated in 2023. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to quantify the effects of topography, climate, vegetation physiological phenology, C input, permafrost conditions, and soil environment on SOC stocks, and a spatial distribution map of SOC stocks in the 0–30 cm soil layer was generated. The results indicate that topography regulates C input through three distinct pathways by shaping the climate: directly, and indirectly via the permafrost environment and plant physiology and phenology, thereby driving the spatial pattern of SOC stocks. C input exerted the strongest influence on SOC stocks across all soil layers, with its effect gradually weakening with increasing depth. It is concluded that depth-specific environmental factors must be considered in SOC dynamics assessment. The mean SOC stocks in the 0–30 cm soil layer was estimated to be approximately 9.37 kg/m². High SOC stocks values were consistently concentrated along river margins across all soil layers. In this work, we also demonstrated that spatially explicit estimates of SOC stocks based on timely investigations are important for assessing C storage against the background of considerable environmental changes across the boreal montane forest permafrost regions."

To alleviate this, a computer vision model for product identification can be implemented as part of a larger shelf-monitoring system. However, current datasets for object detection in retail settings often lack specific class labels for each SKU instance, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of computer vision models in real-world environments. To address this, we introduce MSDD (Mini-mart Shelf Detection Dataset), a dataset consisting of 300 shelf images containing nearly 14,000 product instances with more than 100 unique SKUs, each with their own class labels. The dataset is further divided into six broad categories, which were used to evaluate the effectiveness of four computer vision models for product identification: Faster RCNN, YOLOv11, Vision Transformer (YOLOS), and RetinaNet with ResNet-101. Our results show that YOLOv11 achieves superior performance, with an average mAP50-95 of 58.44% and an average mAP50 of 74.69 %, with only Faster R-CNN outperforming it with an average mAP50 which is 76.11 %. YOLOv11 is superior in terms of average mAP50-95 compared to other models. We also observed that models, especially YOLOS generally struggled with fine-grained discrimination of products exhibiting minimal packaging variations, irregular shapes, and non-uniform shelf arrangements. These findings provide retailers with actionable insights for implementing automated shelf-monitoring systems."

The paper aims to enhance power quality and voltage stability for sensitive loads prone to grid outages and wind-induced voltage fluctuations. To minimize voltage drop and ensure continuous load voltage support, the DFIG system incorporates a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). The effectiveness of several control strategies was developed and compared, including adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), proportional-integral-derivative (PID), tilt-integral derivative (TID), proportional integral (PI), and fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FOPID).MATLAB/Simulink was used to simulate the proposed system under various fault and voltage unbalance scenarios for a 9 MW grid-connected dual-feed induction generator-based wind farm. Simulation results show that advanced controllers, particularly ANFIS and FOPID, significantly improve the performance of DVRs by stabilizing load voltage patterns and efficiently adjusting voltage drop. Compared to all DVR controllers, the proposed modified ANFIS control system resolves the signal overshooting and ripples issues associated with traditional control methods, such as the classic PI control system. In DVRs, ripples and excess voltage increase with PI (16%), PID (32%), TID (10%), and FOPID (10%), while the ANFIS control system exhibits no ripple or excess voltage injections at the same time (0.07s-0.09s). These findings demonstrate how intelligent, microcontroller-level control strategies can improve dynamic voltage recovery and power quality in modern power systems."

    "abstract": "Recovering High Dynamic Range (HDR) images from multiple Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) images becomes challenging when the SDR images exhibit noticeable degradation and missing content. Leveraging scene-specific semantic priors offers a promising solution for restoring heavily degraded regions. However, these priors are typically extracted from sRGB SDR images, the domain/format gap poses a significant challenge when applying it to HDR imaging. To address this issue, we propose a general framework that transfers semantic knowledge derived from SDR domain via self-distillation to boost existing HDR reconstruction. Specifically, the proposed framework first introduces the Semantic Priors Guided Reconstruction Model (SPGRM), which leverages SDR image semantic knowledge to address ill-posed problems in the initial HDR reconstruction results. Subsequently, we leverage a self-distillation mechanism that constrains the color and content information with semantic knowledge, aligning the external outputs between the baseline and SPGRM. Furthermore, to transfer the semantic knowledge of the internal features, we utilize a Semantic Knowledge Alignment Module (SKAM) to fill the missing semantic contents with the complementary masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly boosts HDR imaging quality for existing methods without altering the network architecture."

While deepfake detection has been extensively explored for high-resource languages like English, low-resource languages remain critically underexamined. This paper introduces a systematic benchmark of deepfake audio detection methods for Urdu, a language characterized by its rich morphology and phonetic complexity. We evaluate convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including LCNN, CNN–LSTM with Attention, and Whisper variants, employing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as front-end features. To address data scarcity, we construct three dataset configurations, baseline, augmented, and extended derived from an existing Urdu deepfake corpus and enhanced through controlled augmentation and additional recordings. Our experiments, conducted with multiple random seeds and statistical validation, demonstrate that MFCC-based models, particularly Whisper-small, achieve strong performance with an Equal Error Rate as low as 0.50%. Robustness tests under noise, pitch, and tempo perturbations highlight the limitations of lightweight CNNs and underscore the advantages of transformer embeddings for handling Urdu’s linguistic variability. This study represents the first structured benchmark of deepfake audio detection techniques for Urdu, offering empirical insights into how language characteristics influence model performance and generalization.

This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR models for MDD. Next, we define a more general segmentation-free method that takes all possible segmentations of the canonical transcription into account (GOP-SF). We give a theoretical account of our definition of GOP-SF, an implementation that solves potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which allows the use of acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and speechocean762 datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the dependency of GOP-SF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with recent studies over the speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment."

Traditional fixed-time or rule-based traffic signal systems often lack the flexibility to adapt to dynamic and non-uniform traffic patterns, particularly in densely populated cities. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a scalable, cloud-based framework for adaptive traffic signal optimization using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the proposed system, each intersection is governed by an independent agent trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Agents learn traffic signal policies from localized, real-time observations, including vehicle counts, waiting times, and signal states, enabling decentralized, context-aware control. The framework is designed for cloud deployment, leveraging Google Colab and Google Cloud Storage for scalable training, consistent metric logging, and reproducible post-simulation analysis. Traffic behavior is modeled using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) platform, ensuring a realistic and flexible environment for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the DRL-based system significantly outperforms traditional fixed-time control across key metrics such as average waiting time, vehicle queue length, throughput, and congestion levels. Performance improvements are especially evident under high-density and variable traffic conditions, where adaptability is most critical. In addition, the system exhibits robust convergence across episodes, while the cloud-integrated design ensures scalability, reproducibility, and practical applicability for smart city deployment."

In case of dental abutments, due to close contact of the material with peri-implant soft tissue, it is expected that the surface supports gingival cell adhesion while preventing bacterial diffusion at the interface. Laser surface texturing has demonstrated the possibility to fabricate micro- and nanostructures on large-scale surfaces of various materials with new characteristics and functionalities. Here, we demonstrate the possibility to generate large-scale laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) by picosecond laser-texturing of Ti and Ti6Al4V surfaces, in a contamination-free approach. Uniform LIPSS formation is confirmed by morpho-chemical analyses using a scanning electron microscopy and a scanning near-field optical microscopy. The behavior of primary human gingival epithelial cells (hGEpiCs) and gingival fibroblast cells (hGFCs) on laser modified surfaces was evaluated to assess samples biocompatibility. It was shown that LIPSS fabricated on titanium substrates promote more favorable cellular response, including better cell attachment and higher proliferation rates of hGEpiCs. Meanwhile, LIPSS on Ti6Al4V surfaces enhance hGFCs adhesion and proliferation which is essential for improving tissue healing around dental implants. Moreover, laser texturing on Ti6Al4V surfaces induces lower expression of alpha-SMA protein which is associated with fibrosis development, showing positive implications for peri-implant soft tissue integration in implantology."

    "abstract": "The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.5\\sim 1.8$ </tex-math></inline-formula> dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.8\\sim 4.4$ </tex-math></inline-formula> dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes."

However, existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector, and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4% mAP and 74.7% NDS, while running <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.84\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> faster than other leading methods.

A gain improvement of 3.9 dB is obtained by optimizing the length of the radiator. The radiator is then bonded on a silicon interposer on which a benzocyclobutene-based coplanar waveguide with ground to glass-based SIW transition structure is designed by considering low-loss interconnections. Thereafter, a 1×1 glass-based antenna and a 1×4 antenna array were fabricated using through-glass via technology. Results showed peak gains of 10.2 and 14.7 dBi with bandwidths of 25.6% and 31.5%, respectively. The proposed antennas can be further integrated three-dimensionally with other active components."

The system features four concentric detector rings and two interchangeable high-aperture-ratio tungsten collimator rings optimized for high-resolution (HR) and general-purpose (GP) imaging applications. Detector rings contain 480, 720, 960, and 1,200 evenly distributed GAGG(Ce) scintillators, each measuring 0.84 mm (tangential) × 6 mm (radial) × 20 mm (axial) and separated by 0.84-mm gaps to enable effective photon collimation. Inner detector rings and the collimator ring collectively provide collimation for photons reaching subsequent outer rings. Dual-end SiPM readouts facilitate axial depth-of-interaction measurements. Phantom and mouse studies are performed to assess the system’s resolution, sensitivity, and field-of-view volume, and SC-SPECT demonstrates generally superior performance compared with state-of-the-art small-animal SPECT systems.

While recent work has adapted vision-language models for FedDG using prompt learning, the prevailing “one-prompt-fits-all” paradigm struggles with sample diversity, causing a marked performance decline on personalized samples. The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture offers a promising solution for specialization. However, existing MoE-based prompt learning methods suffer from two key limitations: coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level pRompt mIxture with Parameter-free routing framework for FedDG. TRIP treats prompts as multiple experts, and assigns individual tokens within an image to distinct experts, facilitating the capture of fine-grained visual patterns. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP introduces a parameter-free routing mechanism based on capacity-aware clustering and Optimal Transport (OT). First, tokens are grouped into capacity-aware clusters to ensure balanced workloads. These clusters are then assigned to experts via OT, stabilized by mapping cluster centroids to static, non-learnable keys. The final instance-specific prompt is synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communicating as few as 1K parameters.

    "abstract": "Money laundering is the process of hiding the origin of illicit funds to make them appear legitimate, thereby threatening the integrity of financial systems. To detect money laundering activities, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted to model complex relational structures in transaction networks. However, a closer inspection of real-world money laundering cases reveals that launderers deliberately establish connections with multiple licit accounts to mask their illicit attributes. Such disguising behavior introduces network heterogeneity, which contradicts the fundamental assumption of homophily for most GNNs. Additionally, money launderers further conceal their activities by obscuring illicit fund flows through multihop transaction paths. This strategy poses a significant challenge for GNNs, as their limited receptive fields struggle to capture such long-range dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-view graph representation learning method, named DC-LCG, to detect money laundering. DC-LCG employs complementary local and contextual views to expose disguises and trace illicit flows, respectively. The local view implements a soft-label-guided dynamic grouping and aggregation method that separates nodes into illicit and licit groups, performing probability-weighted aggregations to mitigate network heterogeneity and expose disguises within transaction networks. The contextual view employs a dynamic path pruning method to filter licit nodes and enhance paths relevance, followed by multipath semantic fusion through transformer-based encoding to capture long-range dependencies across multihop transaction paths. A mutual attention mechanism integrates both views to create comprehensive node representations. Experiments on three public transaction datasets show that DC-LCG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2%–10% across evaluation metrics."

Unlike existing approaches that rely on event generation models or contrast maximization, EROAM employs a spherical event representation by projecting events onto a unit sphere and introduces Event Spherical Iterative Closest Point (ES-ICP), a novel geometric optimization framework designed specifically for event camera data. The spherical representation simplifies rotational motion formulation while operating in a continuous spherical domain, enabling enhanced spatial resolution. Our system features an efficient map management approach using incremental k-d tree structures and intelligent regional density control, ensuring optimal computational performance during long-term operation. Combined with parallel point-to-line optimization, EROAM achieves efficient computation without compromising accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that EROAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our method maintains consistent performance under challenging conditions, including high angular velocities and extended sequences, where other methods often fail or show significant drift. Additionally, EROAM produces high-quality panoramic reconstructions with preserved fine structural details."

    "abstract": "Relative Localization (RelLoc) is crucial for consistent decision-making in multi-robot systems. To achieve efficient RelLoc, two key problems must be solved: how to evaluate the RelLoc accuracy, and how to coordinate the robot swarm to enhance it when it does not meets the stopping criterion. Existing research mainly focuses on passively optimizing relative poses, without explicitly evaluating the uncertainty in this process or efficiently improving RelLoc accuracy in an active manner. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Localization Graph (DLG) to evaluate, monitor, and actively improve inter-robot RelLoc accuracy. To address the first problem, we propose the Metric of Relative Localization Accuracy (MRLA) based on the pose covariance without requiring prior knowledge of relative poses. Specifically, graduated non-convexity factor graph optimization and uncertainty propagation is applied to calculate the transformation and update the pose covariance between the initial frames, followed by outlier rejection through hypothesis testing. Then, the DLG is constructed by assigning the MRLA between robots as the edge weight, which illustrates the status of RelLoc in the multi-robot system. To address the second problem, we further introduce an active RelLoc enhancement strategy on top of the DLG that triggers additional inter-robot measurements when needed, enabling autonomous, accuracy-cost aware RelLoc enhancement. When the MRLA between all robot pairs exceeds the threshold, the stopping criterion for RelLoc is satisfied, ensuring high-accuracy RelLoc among robots. The DLG is sensor-independent, focusing on evaluating and enhancing RelLoc accuracy. It is instantiated on a place recognition RelLoc pipeline as a representative case study. Simulations demonstrate that when the MRLA in the DLG reaches 0.98, the Absolute Trajectory Error is less than 0.1 m, and the DLG is further verified in both indoor and outdoor experiments."

Quantitative metrics, including recall, precision, F1-score and runtime further verified its stable and reliable performance across different environments.

The fly-hover-communicate protocol (FHCP) is considered, where the UAV visits a set of hovering positions and communicates with one corresponding SN while hovering at each position. The optimization problem of making a trade-off between spectrum and energy efficiency (EE) under the transmission prioritized scheme (TPS) in FHCP is analyzed. For the single-SN case, the problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: UAV trajectory and number of reflecting elements (NoRE) optimization. For the multi-SN case, it is decomposed into three sub-optimization problems: user association, NoRE, and UAV trajectory planning. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm incorporating the genetic algorithm, conditional judgment-binary search algorithm, and successive convex approximation algorithm are applied to tackle this problem. Simulation results indicate that the TPS effectively increases EE compared with that when the UAV hovers directly above each SN."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of insufficient wind resistance stability and low detection accuracy for strand breakage defects during overhead power line inspection, this study proposes a dual-mode inspection robot solution integrating a Dynamic Conforming Pressing (DCP) mechanism and an infrared vision system. Firstly, a dual-mode inspection robot with flight-to-walking mode transition capability was designed and developed. The robot incorporates a multi-spring buffered DCP structure to enhance operational stability under wind loads. Subsequently, an efficient infrared vision detection system was established based on the YOLO11 framework, integrating the ShuffleNetV2 lightweight backbone network with BiFPN multi-scale feature fusion mechanisms, and validated on a strand breakage defect dataset. Experimental results indicate that the DCP-equipped robot reduces stabilization time by over 40% under wind loads of 4 m/s, 8 m/s, and 12 m/s. Meanwhile, the enhanced YOLO11 model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.991 with an inference speed of 85.26 FPS, surpassing the performance of Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv8. This research demonstrates the effective integration of mechanical stability and intelligent perception capabilities, providing critical technical support for advancing the intelligence and reliability of power line inspection systems."

    "abstract": "Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectorsneed to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved variational mode decomposition (VMD) framework integrated with the Hilbert transform (HT) for decomposing and reconstructing nonstationary signals in high-noise, multi-frequency environments. Unlike traditional VMD methods, the proposed framework introduces a soft data fidelity constraint and a frequency alignment scheme to mitigate the effects of heavy-tailed noise and reduce mode mixing. Employing adaptive regularization in the transform domain further refines intrinsic mode extraction, capturing finer multi-scale details. An additional amplitude matching stage, driven by an LMS-based mechanism, adjusts gain factors to rebuild each component accurately. Experiments on synthetic signals demonstrate improved noise suppression and mode separation, as evidenced by lower RMSE/MAE and higher SNR and correlation values compared to traditional VMD. Across SNRs of 10, 15, and 20 dB, the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional VMD in RMSE/MAE, SNR, and correlation. Hilbert spectra for the two-tone signal and the real bearing signal exhibit sharper ridges and more concentrated energy, indicating improved mode separation and noise suppression. Furthermore, the HT-based timefrequency representation clearly illustrates energy concentration and instantaneous frequency variations, enabling time-frequency analysis of complex, nonstationary signals. These results underscore the potential of the improved VMD-HT framework for a wide range of applications in engineering, energy, and biomedical contexts, where robust, adaptive, and precise signal processing is critical."

In this study, we present two wearable electrode designs—a headband and a neckband—tailored specifically for ECG signal acquisition from behind the ear and around the neck regions. These designs were benchmarked against standard Ag/AgCl electrodes over 30 voluntary participants and demonstrated maximum correlation values as high as 98% and above for both designs, with an average correlation of 90.1% and 91.9% for the headband and neckband, respectively. A detailed investigation of six different electrode placements on the neck was also conducted to determine the optimal positions for recording ECG signals. The robustness of the designs was evaluated through 40-minute ECG recordings and under various intense movement conditions. Furthermore, to advance the development of sustainable and reliable wearable e-textile systems, we evaluated the real-life performance of textile electrodes reduced using two different agents: L-ascorbic acid, an eco-friendly, bio-based compound, and sodium borohydride, a commonly used but toxic chemical. While both agents are already known to effectively reduce graphene oxide, the primary objective was to comparatively assess the functional performance of the resulting electrodes under real-world conditions, specifically in scenarios relevant to wearable ECG monitoring applications. The reported results enhance the understanding of the efficiency and performance of the developed wearable e-textile designs for biopotential signal monitoring."

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fair and robust integration of sensing, communication, computing, and control in consumer health electronics. Our approach adopts a three-fold strategy: (i) feature disentanglement to separate environment-dependent signals from task-relevant features, reducing bias in sensing and decision-making; (ii) a fairness-aware optimization scheme that balances resource allocation across diverse devices and network conditions, ensuring equitable performance; and (iii) loss landscape flattening through sharpness-aware optimization to enhance robustness against distribution shifts in communication channels and computing platforms. Extensive experiments on representative IoT and edge-computing benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves both fairness and stability across heterogeneous consumer health scenarios, providing a promising direction for equitable and reliable smart device ecosystems."

Novel-view synthesis offers a promising way to augment training data, yet existing methods struggle with speckle noise and radiometric variability inherent to SAR imagery. We introduce a SAR-specific self-supervised representation learning framework based on co-domain augmentations that operate directly on pixel magnitudes. By combining multiplicative Rayleigh speckle and random monotonic intensity remapping, our method learns features that are invariant to speckle realizations while preserving structural and geometric cues. These learned representations are then used to supervise a latent-diffusion novel-view generator adapted from zero-1-to-3 through a projected feature-matching loss, replacing fragile pixel-space comparisons with noise-robust feature-space supervision. Experiments on MSTAR and MSTAR-OOD demonstrate substantial improvements in identity preservation, pose consistency, and perceptual quality for both seen and unseen targets. Although evaluated on object-centric SAR for automatic target recognition, the proposed framework is content-agnostic and naturally extends to scene-level SAR novel-view synthesis."

    "abstract": "In the paradigm of decentralized learning, a group of agents collaborate to learn a global model using a distributed dataset without a central server; nevertheless, it is severely challenged by the heterogeneity of the data distribution across the agents. For example, the data may be distributed non-independently and identically, and even be noised or poisoned. To address these data challenges, we propose ROSS, a novel robust decentralized stochastic learning algorithm based on Shapley values, in this paper. Specifically, in each round, each agent leverages its local gradient and the cross-gradients from its neighbors (i.e., the derivative of its local loss function and the derivatives of its neighbors’ local loss functions evaluated at its local model) to update its local model in a momentum-like manner, while we innovate in weighting the derivatives according to their contributions measured by Shapley values. We perform solid theoretical analysis to reveal the linear convergence speedup of our ROSS algorithm. We also verify the efficacy of our algorithm through extensive experiments on public datasets. Our results demonstrate that, in face of the above variety of data challenges, our ROSS algorithm have oblivious advantages over existing state-of-the-art proposals in terms of both convergence and prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "Ultra-wideband rigid body localization (RBL) represents a pivotal technology for achieving high-precision indoor localization. However, it encounters significant challenges, particularly non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation errors and reduced vertical observability in complex environments, both of which considerably undermine the robustness of existing three-dimensional(3D) RBL techniques. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces a novel, robust 3D-RBL methodology based on hierarchical constraint fusion, referred to as HC-RBL. This approach enhances performance with a three-tier optimization framework: 1) at the sensor layer, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to derive the globally optimal geometric configuration of sensor anchor nodes and tag nodes, thereby maximizing spatial observability; 2) at the signal layer, a hybrid robust M-estimation coupled with multiple outlier detection techniques is leveraged to effectively suppress the localization error; 3) at the trajectory layer, the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing algorithm is applied, incorporating rigid-body kinematic constraints to ensure the physical consistency of 3D motion trajectory. The dataset was obtained from indoor wheeled robot experiments, covering approximately 500 m of trajectory over 16 min. In indoor NLOS environments, with a ranging accuracy of 0.31 m, experimental results from multiple wheeled robot localization tests demonstrate that HC-RBL significantly outperforms conventional RBL methods, achieving an 76% reduction in root mean square error to 0.103 m and an 80% reduction in the 95% cumulative error to 0.182 m. The proposed HC-RBL method exhibits remarkable robustness in complex indoor environments against pronounced NLOS effects."

The analysis is validated through simulation and AC sweep results in two practical regimes using a 200 W SS-WPTS. PI controller gains are systematically determined in PLECS software using the AC sweep function to ensure robust performance, highlighting the critical role of adjusting switching frequency relative to resonance. Experimental validation on a 200 W prototype demonstrates that both control methods, when combined with PI regulation, achieve reliable voltage regulation, fast set-point tracking, and robust disturbance rejection under various scenarios. The system maintains stable operation despite variations in load, DC supply voltage, battery voltage, and misalignment.

This study proposes a two-stage recommendation system using the KNearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to support intercity EV travel. In the first stage, geodesic distance filtering identifies candidate stations; in the second, route-based refinement with the Google Maps Directions API ensures practical alignment. The system outputs charging stations positioned along the direction of travel at intervals matched to vehicle range and state of charge. Designed primarily for EV drivers, the system reduces range anxiety and improves trip efficiency, while also providing policymakers and developers with a framework for strengthening Indonesia's EV ecosystem.

However, recent studies reveal security vulnerabilities in EVs and EVCSs against attacks. This paper addresses these security concerns by introducing injection attacks on the front-end Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) communication using the ISO 15118 protocol. Malicious EV owners or compromised EVCS supply equipment can inject harmful packets, potentially leading to runtime modifications and malware attacks. To counter this threat, we propose an innovative bidirectional recurrent attentive graph neural network (BiRAGNN)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) that dynamically captures spatiotemporal aspects and the bidirectional flow of information, while leveraging an attention mechanism to effectively detect injection attacks within EVs and EVCSs. The BiRAGNN model is founded on a probabilistic charging graph of real cities. Other deep learning and graph-based IDSs are also investigated as evaluation benchmarks. The IDSs are examined against a standalone system (from a single EVCS) and multi-node systems (from 8, 50, and 100-node EVCSs), all with packet-level, flow-level, and fused packet and flow-level data.

Accurate and timely prediction of slope failures remains challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrology and geotechnics, as well as spatial variability in soil conditions. This paper presents a hydrology-informed early-warning system that integrates Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for real-time landslide monitoring and short-term forecasting. The proposed system is demonstrated using a laboratory-scale slope model designed as a modular monitoring unit that can be replicated across multiple locations for regional deployment. The system is trained and validated using both real-time sensor data collected from controlled laboratory rainfall experiments and synthetic hydrological datasets generated through artificial rainfall simulations that emulate large-scale, failure-prone slope conditions. Multiple ML models were developed using slope tilt measurements, soil matric suction, and soil moisture data to predict slope instability. A web-based graphical user interface enables remote, real-time visualization of sensor data. It provides automated alerts while supporting forecasts of slope failure one, two, and four days in advance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system effectively detects slope movements and forecasts failures with acceptable accuracy, low computational overhead (approximately 148ms per sensor transmission cycle), and near real-time end-to-end latency from data acquisition to visualization. Among the evaluated models, the random forest model consistently achieved superior performance. This work establishes a validated proof of concept under controlled laboratory conditions, with future field validation on natural slopes identified as a critical next step. In addition, a cost analysis for a prospective large-scale deployment in the Greater Houston Area demonstrates the economic feasibility of the proposed monitoring architecture."

    "abstract": "Multi-satellite cooperative transmission (MSCT) is a promising paradigm to enhance spectral efficiency in Low Earth Orbit constellations. However, heterogeneous Doppler shifts and coupled multi-satellite interference hinder the capacity improvement of conventional precoding in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Although orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation exhibits robustness against doubly-selective channels, its direct application in massive MIMO faces prohibitive computational complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a joint precoding and link scheduling (JPL) design for OTFS-based MSCT systems. Specifically, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that couples continuous precoding matrices with discrete link indicators, and decompose it into two tractable subproblems. For precoder design, based on regularized zero-forcing (RZF)-criterion, we present single-satellite precoding (SSP) and multi-satellite precoding (MSP) in the delay-Doppler domain for different MSCT modes, and optimize per-satellite regularization coefficients to maximize the sum-rate. Leveraging the quasi-banded MIMO-OTFS structure, a low-complexity RZF algorithm is developed to reduce the cubic complexity to quadratic order without performance loss. Based on random matrix theory, we conduct asymptotic analysis and derive the deterministic equivalents of sum-rate for SSP and MSP. For link scheduling, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed based on tabu search to iteratively optimize link indicators for maximizing the sum-rate. By alternately optimizing precoding matrices with each scheduling iteration, the JPL algorithm is proposed to achieve near-optimal sum-rate performance with polynomial computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed schemes significantly improve the sum-rate performance compared to existing works."

While viable, these methods can be computationally demanding and offer limited insight into the structural properties of optimal deployments. In contrast, this paper introduces a structured, parametric optimization framework. We constrain the panel deployment to a lattice, reducing the high-dimensional problem to optimizing a few parameters that define the lattice's overall scale and shape. Through numerical simulations, our method is shown to perform nearly indistinguishable from that achieved by a highly complex benchmark, while it outperforms standard approaches like Majorization-Minimizing-Lloyd's algorithm (MM-Lloyd). Furthermore, we identify that a simple, non-optimized, evenly spaced grid can achieve 96% of the benchmark's performance, offering a highly efficient and practical heuristic."

However, the audio modality often dominates the learning process because of its direct connection to the output. This leads networks to focus more on audio-related parameters, while the visual modality is underutilized. This issue is especially noticeable in cases where the visual input is of low quality, as the visual modality provides limited useful information. To address this problem, we propose the Contribution-aware Multimodal Balance Network (CAMB-Net). This approach uses the dominant modality to guide the extraction and processing of low-contribution features in the weaker modality. CAMB-Net introduces two main innovations: (1) it identifies the dominant and weak modalities by analyzing the similarity between each modality's features and the fused features, then divides the weak modality's features into high- and low-contribution groups for refinement; and (2) it leverages cross-modal features to guide the extraction of low-contribution features within the weak modality, with high-contribution features from the weak modality influencing the guidance process. We evaluated CAMB-Net on datasets with both high- and low-quality video inputs. The results show significant improvements, with gains of 0.4 dB in SDRi, 0.5 dB in SI-SNRi, and 0.05 in PESQ under high-quality video conditions compared to the state-of-the-art IIANet model. In more challenging scenarios with visual occlusion in LRS3, CAMB-Net achieves strong results, reaching 15.2 dB in SDRi, 15.6 dB in SI-SNRi, and 3.19 in PESQ, demonstrating its robustness."

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the biological processes underlying disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden disrupts neuronal function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding, although recent studies have begun to bridge the two by coupling neuronal and pathological processes. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, mathematical models that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology are needed. This review surveys the two modeling approaches and highlights efforts to unify them, emphasizing that linking neuronal activity and disease progression is key to identifying strategies that slow, halt, or reverse degeneration and restore neural function."

Specifically, the block error rate (BLER) and age-of-information (AoI) of the investigated system with residual self-interference and imperfect successive interference cancellation are derived. Moreover, the power allocation coefficient is optimized to minimize the average BLER and the influences of various parameters on system's performance are examined. We enhance the BLER and AoI performance by employing the maximal-ratio combining and maximal-ratio transmission techniques at multiple antennas of source and destination nodes. Simulation results validate our analytical frameworks. Numerical results indicate that employing multi-antennas for a NOMA system with FD relay gives exceptionally low average BLER that fulfils the targets of high reliability and latency of the wireless systems. Furthermore, the optimal AoI of the investigated system can be achieved by selecting a suitable block length. In particular, the minimum AoI is obtained when SNR = 10 dB and the block length is 300. Also, the average BLER and average AoI of the considered NOMA-FD system outperform conventional orthogonal multiple access and half-duplex (HD) systems. Especially when the block length is less than 250, the AoI of the FD system is reduced by 90% compared to that of the HD system."

To overcome these limitations, we have developed a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) fiber-optic Fabry-Perot (FP) acoustic sensor using bulk-silicon-micromachined 710-nm diaphragms. The thin diaphragm was fabricated in a multilayer (Au/Ti/Si3N4) configuration to achieve high sensitivity and mechanical strength for acoustic sensing applications. More than 250 diaphragms with high reflectivity and easy-to-align features, such as sloped walls and alignment grooves, could be produced from a single batch process. Using a tunable laser, we confirmed the consistent spectral properties of the integrated FP sensors, including a uniform free spectral range (FSR) and an interference contrast greater than 21 dB. From acoustic sensing experiments, the sensitivity and minimum detectable pressure (MDP) were measured to be 179.3 mV/Pa and 247.6 μPa/√Hz at 140 kHz, respectively. The frequency response was almost flat in the 20–150 kHz range. We constructed a 4-point sensor array to test its performance in detecting and localizing acoustic events. Using the generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, average errors of 0.95 cm (1.34 %) and 1.4 cm (1.82 %) were obtained in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) location tests, respectively."

To address these challenges, this work presents a high thrust-to-weight ratio piezoelectric robot based on magnetic inertial impact mechanism, which is equipped with a two-stage displacement amplification mechanism. A magnetic adhesion design is introduced to mitigate interference from power cables, substantially enhancing the system’s operational stability.

Notably, it can achieve 180° inverted locomotion and 90° vertical climbing under specific conditions. Finite element analysis, mathematical modeling of magnetic adhesion forces, and Simulink-based dynamic simulations were performed to validate the design. Experimental results demonstrate that under 150 V. The robot can carry a load of up to 3 kg, achieves a load-to-weight ratio of up to 283:1, exhibiting outstanding thrust performance and anti-interference capability.

However, conventional 1-bit metasurfaces are fundamentally constrained by binary phase quantization, leading to symmetric radiation patterns under normal incidence and impeding high-gain single-beam generation. Here, we introduce a continuous Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) prephase strategy to address this limitation. By rotating the meta-atom, a PB phase is added atop its 0/π digital state, yielding arbitrary initial phase compensation and breaking the symmetry. To validate this concept, a prototype composed of 16×16 elements is fabricated, designed receiver-transmitter (R-T) metasurfaces enabling circular-to-linear (CTL) polarization conversions. The metasurface is excited by circularly polarized plane waves generated by a feed array, enabling a highly compact overall profile of 0.44λ0. Beam steering within ±60° is achieved by switching the states of PIN diodes embedded in the meta-atom to introduce a 180° phase modulation. The proposed approach provides a compact, programmable, and polarization-diverse platform for wavefront shaping, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional metasurface-based communication systems."

Recent advances in deep learning techniques have significantly improved the inertial classification task's performance and robustness. However, a standardized benchmark for evaluating and comparing these methods remains lacking. Such a benchmark is critical for ensuring fair and consistent evaluation and future development. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by defining and analysing eleven data-driven techniques designed to enhance neural inertial classification networks. Our investigation focuses on three key components: network architecture, data augmentation, and data preprocessing. In addition, we conduct comparative analyses to identify the optimal window size for each dataset. This is a parameter that substantially affects model performance but is often overlooked. The experiments were conducted across seven datasets collected from 229 participants and with a total of 4482 minutes. Among the evaluated techniques, data augmentation through rotation and multi-head network architectures yielded the most consistent performance improvements. Our experimental results show that rotation-based augmentation and multi-head architectures consistently yield the highest gains, improving accuracy by up to 9.72% depending on the dataset and window length. We additionally quantify the effect of temporal window size, demonstrating that longer segments (2s) provide the largest average improvement, whereas shorter windows better suit real-time deployment. Finally, we propose a benchmarking strategy to support the future development and evaluation of deep learning models for inertial activity recognition."

    "abstract": "Smartphone-based location-based services (LBS) increasingly demand high horizontal positioning accuracy with reliability. However, the performance of smartphone precise point positioning (PPP) remains limited by two primary factors. First, due to the mass-market and compact design of smartphones, low-cost antennas and receivers introduce multipath effects and clock-reset errors, complicating the differentiation between reliable and unreliable measurements. Second, conventional constant-acceleration kinematic models cannot precisely capture rapid changes in motion, such as during acceleration, deceleration, or turning, leading to disturbances in the predicted state covariance in dynamic PPP. To address these issues, this paper explores the application of an adaptive robust quality control strategy for smartphone dynamic PPP, in which both state and measurement covariance are adaptively adjusted through dual detection mechanisms. Time-differenced carrier-phase (TDCP) observations, derived from robust least squares estimation, are employed to construct a learning factor for identifying model disturbances, enabling adaptive updating of the predicted state covariance matrix. To enable a statistically rigorous t-test on the standardized innovations for outlier detection, matrix projection is first employed to mitigate clock-reset effects and restore the normality of the innovations. The t-test then allows for the adaptive adjustment of the measurement noise covariance, improving filter robustness under dynamic conditions. Tests on datasets from typical expressway and urban complex scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in positioning accuracy. Horizontal root mean square error decreased by up to 27%, and 50th, 68th, and 95th percentile statistics improved by maximums of 32%, 33%, and 21%, respectively. These results indicate that adapting both state and measurement covariance through TDCP-aided detection and innovations t-tests effectively enhances the reliability and robustness of smartphone dynamic PPP in challenging dynamic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Distributed adaptive direct position determination (D-ADPD) is a time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization algorithm designed for single-hop sensor networks. The algorithm is iterative and typically initialized by using two-step methods. However, the obtained initial values and the convergence performance of the D-ADPD are poor in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, resulting in significant positioning errors. The algorithm also fails when channel propagation induces phase offsets. To address these issues, this paper proposes a distributed direct position determination algorithm with single-hop transmission. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: First, a distributed frequency domain detection method is proposed to identify the radiated signal's frequency components. A cost function is then formulated based on these detected frequency components with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion to eliminate the influence of out-of-band noise. Second, a coarse positioning method is introduced to provide reliable initial values for subsequent iteration. Finally, the algorithm iteratively estimates target positions and compensates for phase offsets using the diffusion strategy and the gradient method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the D-ADPD and other similar methods in low SNR environments. When the SNR is between -15 dB and 10 dB, the root mean square error of the proposed positioning algorithm is approximately 5 dB lower than other distributed direct localization methods and about 10 dB lower than that of the classical distributed two-step method. Furthermore, it is insensitive to the channel-induced phase offset, exhibiting greater robustness than the D-ADPD."

This paper presents a reusable modular architecture framework for Flutter applications that integrates Clean Architecture principles with Creational and Structural design patterns.

To evaluate architectural quality, a case study was conducted on two representative modules (Login and Setting) using the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK94) variants of LCOM and CBO metrics to measure internal cohesion and coupling. The methodology includes structural design documentation, controller pseudocode, and manual metric computation derived from class diagrams.

We further map these results to ISO/IEC 25010 maintainability sub-characteristics, highlighting modularity, testability, and analyzability. The main contribution is a practical and documentable framework with reproducible evaluation steps that software engineers can adopt as a baseline for modular Flutter systems. Future work will extend empirical evaluation to larger applications and include comparative baselines against Provider, BLoC, and MVVM architectures."

In addition, sensitivity to the illusory pulling sensation tended to decline in some older female participants, suggesting that factors related to aging and/or gender difference may be involved in this phenomenon. In this study, we aimed to clarify the contribution of somatosensory and cognitive functions to the illusory pulling sensation, focusing on aging and gender difference to examine these contributions. Sixty older participants aged 63 to 80 years (30 males, 30 females) completed seven assessments, covering sensitivity to the illusory pulling sensation and a range of somatosensory and cognitive functions from vibration detection thresholds to general cognitive ability assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Consistent with prior findings, older females exhibited significantly lower sensitivity to the illusion. Interestingly, although gender differences were observed in some of the assessment items, such as hand length and performance on the parallel-setting task, none of these factors mediated the gender effect on the illusion. While age itself did not have a direct effect on the illusion, an indirect effect was observed through general cognitive function as assessed by the MMSE. These findings suggest that the illusory pulling sensation tends to weaken not only with aging, but also particularly when aging is accompanied by cognitive decline. Overall, gender and cognitive function may play key roles in individual differences in the illusory pulling sensation."

To address this, we propose a dual energy distribution model which stores the cycle information related to SoC trajectories within the energy distribution, tackling the problem to seek the full cycle for current action with past operation. A real-time degradation cost calculation formulation is presented to analytically express nonlinear degradation over a continuous action space, without requiring historical SoC backtracking or the rainflow simulation. A real-time power allocation algorithm is designed based on dual energy distribution ranking. Unlike traditional rainflowbased online methods that rely on estimating the marginal degradation cost of infinitesimal actions, our approach allocates power based on the degradation cost evaluated across the entire power range of each battery. Numerical tests and comparison are done for heterogeneous BESS response to frequency regulation service, the results show our method reduces daily degradation costs by 12% to 31% compared to conventional strategies, and with fast solving speed of each response within milliseconds."

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the digitalization of services, finance and communication. As critical infrastructure increasingly moves online, routing security is becoming a national security concern. U.S. regulatory bodies were the first to sound the alarm by formally recognizing the urgency of Internet routing security and calling for nationwide adoption of security protocols. The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) protocol is already the leading standard for protecting Internet routing from hijacking attacks and route leaks. However, RPKI is not secure by design. Research on its security guarantees has shown that despite the minimal public facing interfaces, the software implementations are not only rife with issues, but the nature of these issues is such that they can be easily triggered and disconnect the RPKI security framework from Internet routing, thus severely downgrading RPKI protection benefits. In this work, we evaluate the security properties of RPKI, analyze its attack surface, the required attacker capabilities to launch them, and their consequences on global routing security. We propose that RPKI requires fundamental changes and improvements to mitigate its vulnerabilities, and become robust enough to withstand the eye of the storm."

However, existing studies on student performance prediction have concentrated on traditional settings, often overlooking the unique dynamics of online learning, neglecting data-imbalance issues, and rarely leveraging advanced meta-learning techniques. To address these gaps, this study applies ensemble learning methods Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking to improve predictive accuracy in Educational Data Mining (EDM). Baseline models including Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were evaluated and compared with ensemble approaches. Among these, Stacking with XGBoost yielded the best results, achieving an accuracy of 82.19% and an AUC of 0.93. To mitigate class imbalance, Random Over-Sampling (ROS) was employed, which led to improved precision across all models. The findings underscore the effectiveness of combining ensemble learning with oversampling in predicting academic performance. Future directions include exploring temporal models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and extending this work to multi-institutional, real-time academic dashboards."

In this paper, we propose the <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fed</u>erated <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</u>ulti-modal <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</u>mage <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</u>usion (FedMIF), a general multi-modal image fusion solution across multiple domains that operates without raw data sharing. We notice existing FL methods lack task-specific strategies tailored for general fusion tasks, leading to suboptimal fusion performance. To address this, we propose a four-stage framework that enhances detail features while maintaining overall visual quality, which are 1) Server initialization stage, dual decoders are trained on natural data to regulate feature distribution. 2) Task-agnostic stage, all clients collaboratively train the encoder to improve feature extraction performance. 3) Task-specific stage, training is conducted within relevant tasks to address the negative impact of inconsistent optimization objectives across different tasks. 4) Local-specific stage, local adapters are trained on each client to help mitigate detail loss resulting from model aggregation. Complete subjective and objective comparisons prove that FedMIF could generate information-rich fusion results on four fusion tasks while requiring less communication overhead.

This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3-D) ESA configuration with high degrees of freedom (DoF), which is employed to significantly expand the design space for beyond-limit solutions. A revised multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is presented, which is guided by a Pareto front derived from the bandwidth limit to achieve rapid convergence. Prior knowledge, including structural priors, fabrication constraints, and physical interpretations of design parameters and objectives, is incorporated to efficiently generate effective solutions. The proposed method generates nine solutions, all of which exceed the bandwidth limits. A “radial-beamlet” antenna, fabricated using metal 3-D printing, achieves impedance bandwidth of 50.3% (2.05-3.43 GHz) and realized gain of 1.72-3.86 dBi. The bandwidth-efficiency product of the fabricated solution is 0.402, compared to the performance limit of 0.389. This approach pushes the boundaries of electrically small antennas and provides a new pathway for the advanced design of similar structures."

    "abstract": "Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement learning. The flow- feedback control proves particularly effective during lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow, circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and fluid dynamics.

However, similar to other end-to-end ASR models, LLM-Based ASR (LLM-ASR) models encounter performance degradation when applied across domains. To address this issue, we propose LLM-Based Pseudo-Labeling (LPL), which leverages unlabeled audio data in the target domain to train a domain-adapted LLM-ASR model. Specifically, we propose Hybrid Pseudo-Label Decoding (HPLD) method to refine the quality of pseudo-labels in a quick non-autoregressive manner, achieving a balance between training performance and computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the CTC Assisted Prompt (CAP) method, which offers additional semantic hints to enhance the accuracy of transcriptions generated by the LLM. During training, we incorporate CTC loss at the post-projector position to align speech embedding prompt more effectively and feed masked CTC hypothesis embedding into the LLM prompt for further improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that LPL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other mainstream pseudo-labeling methods, further enhancing the cross-domain performance of LLM-ASR models."

We analyzed 1,507 crypto crowdfunding campaigns and measured milestone concreteness and coherence using established computational linguistics techniques and large language models. Regression results show that fundraising success is positively associated with the concreteness of achieved milestones and the coherence of planned milestones.

    "abstract": "dc plasma jets are widely used in thermal spraying and materials processing due to their advantages of high temperature, low operating cost, and strong environmental adaptability. As the demand for product quality and process stability continues to increase, the stability of plasma jets has become an increasingly critical research topic. However, traditional approaches that evaluate jet characteristics using arc-voltage fluctuations or raw voltage signals, which are highly susceptible to noise in high voltage and strong electromagnetic environments, result in limited low assessment accuracy. For improving the assessment accuracy, based on a self-developed dc arc plasma generating system and jet characteristics monitoring system, a method of filtering the noise by finding the characteristic frequency with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) theory was proposed. By analyzing the time-frequency of the original signals of arc voltage, arc current, and gas flow rate based on the FFT theory, the characteristic frequency was determined, and the noise was filtered to purify the corresponding signals. With the purified signals, the jet stability could be evaluated more accurately. The research results show that the characteristic frequencies of the signals are always in 5–45- and 125–155-Hz bands. By analyzing the characteristics frequencies under various working conditions, the characteristic frequency could be predicted by using a polynomial fitting equation. This method enables rapid extraction of characteristic components and effective noise suppression, providing a robust tool for accurate diagnostics and stability assessment of plasma jets."

    "abstract": "The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) system, which effectively mitigates intra-cell interference and provides precise sensing accuracy, is a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, to fully capitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS) between access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current synchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in the development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel CF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial diversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce the impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the worst-case Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint optimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy communication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust optimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex problem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an MA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization variables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and transmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors. Moreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies, the proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity, thus validating its effectiveness."

We introduce an event-frame joint interaction module that consists of three branches: a base branch, a global awareness attention branch, and a local enhancement attention branch. The base branch processes essential pixel-level features that retain the original structural information. The global branch integrates event data to improve large-scale motion understanding, while the local branch uses large-kernel convolutions to refine fine-grained details in RGB frames. For superior reconstruction performance, we also propose the event-guided multi-scale fusion attention module, which effectively combines local visual information and global frame-event relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuInt-Net achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively, showcasing its superior motion deblurring capabilities."

The antenna consists of an orthogonal-mode filtering feeding circuit, a dual-band dual-circular polarizer, and a 3×3 radiating aperture array. By utilizing a higher-order mode cavity, a converted cross-coupled topology with all-magnetic coupling irises is realized, achieving high-selectivity filtering channels with advantages of easy fabrication and reduced sensitivity. An orthogonal self-diplexing feeding circuit is then constructed by merging two filtering channels through a pair of dual-mode cavities, eliminating the need for separate orthogonal-mode transducers and diplexers, resulting in a more compact structure. The inherent orthogonality of the electromagnetic fields in the two channels enables flexible operating frequencies, adjustable bandwidth, and natural isolation between the two bands. A shared-aperture technique is adopted with a three-stage stepped-rotated rectangular polarizer integrated into a 3×3 array, efficiently converting dual-linearly polarized (LP) waves in adjacent frequency bands into orthogonal circularly polarized (CP) waves, thus enhancing gain performance. For experimental validation, a prototype was fabricated using all-metal 3-D printing technology, ensuring high integration, precision fabrication, and reduced insertion loss. Measurement results demonstrate effective operation across 28.0-28.9 GHz and 30.0-31.0 GHz, with a small frequency ratio of 1.07 and measured radiation gains of 13.3 dBic and 13.2 dBic, respectively.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification can be viewed as a cross-camera retrieval problem, with the assumption that retrieved pedestrians exist in the gallery. However, in actual surveillance scenarios, pedestrians don’t always appear in the camera, and the pedestrians’ temporal and spatial trajectory need be recovered in order to track the pedestrian in the camera network. Motivated by this, we propose a new problem for person re-identification known as “trajectory recovery,” which reconstructs the trajectory of pedestrians in the camera network. Existing datasets lacked the necessary annotated data to address this issue at the same time, so we annotated two new datasets, Market-1501-TR and MSMT17-TR, with each pedestrian’s trajectory annotation. Light variation was also done on both datasets to investigate the effect of light variation on trajectory recovery. Then, we present a multipoint recovery benchmark method that takes into account the relationship between all the query pedestrians and results in an efficient trajectory recovery. To evaluate our method in a new setting, we introduce the degree of trajectory point recovery and the degree of trajectory segment recovery, two new evaluation metrics directly informed by practical surveillance system-level considerations. Experiments on two new datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

The antenna employs a stacked structure of the driven patch and parasitic patch to achieve dual-mode resonance within the band. By loading C-shaped slots and flag-shaped strips on the driven patch, two additional modes are also generated within the band, achieving quad-mode resonance and obtaining a broadband response. Meanwhile, the two loaded structures introduce two near-band radiation nulls based on far-field radiation cancellation, achieving high out-of-band rejection level and enhanced selectivity. Additionally, I-shaped and L-shaped slots are etched to better control the position of nulls and enhance the filtering performance. The measured results show that the proposed antenna operates in the 2.45 GHz ISM band with a relative bandwidth of 21.6%. The out-of-band rejection levels on both sides are 30 and 29.8 dB, respectively, with selectivity of 183.3 and 200 dB/GHz, respectively.

Most existing studies focus on decoding distinctly different tasks, leaving the diversity of cognitive responses elicited by a single stimulus underexplored. We introduced a novel experimental paradigm where a common visual stimulus elicits five distinct cognitive processes: single reach, interception reach, sequence reach, attention reach, and inhibition reach. EEG signatures were analyzed using temporal and spectral methods. A regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) classifier was employed for decoding, utilizing both temporal and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) features. Significant neural activation differences (p < 0.05) were observed across tasks and brain regions. The RLDA classifier achieved high decoding accuracy: 91.72% ± 6.10% for classifying the five cognitive states using ERSP features. Furthermore, for the sequence reach task, temporal features enabled classification of normal versus catch trials with 77.96% ± 7.03% accuracy. All these results demonstrate the potential for EEG-based BCI applications to distinguish diverse cognitive states elicited by identical stimuli, offering new insights for improving the naturalness and intelligence of BCI systems. Future work will focus on enhancing decoding performance and extending this research to online applications."

Herein, in this article, an electrically small pattern reconfigurable Huygens CP antenna with quasi-isotropic beam coverage is presented for WPT enabled IoT applications. It consists of a pair of orthogonally placed crossed Egyptian axe dipoles (EADs), customized reconfigurable capacitively loaded loops (CLLs), and an unbalanced reconfigurable crossed driven-dipole structure. Pattern reconfigurability is realized due to the phase reversal of the EADs by switching the diodes at the center of the additional crossed shorter strips beneath the upper section of the CLLs. Furthermore, to ensure overlapping bandwidths for impedance matching and AR, the effective lengths of the driven-dipole arms are reconfigurable by controlling the diodes. An optimized prototype was fabricated and validated, showing a peak realized gain of 2.45 dBic and a wide 3-dB AR beamwidth of larger than 100° for both modes in an electrically small size (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ka</i>=0.79)."

The results indicate that implementing this optimization model can achieve operational cost efficiencies of between 2.29% to 3.02% compared to empirical data, while also providing a more effective return-handling strategy to enhance supply chain resilience."

Systematic polar codes have not been shown to offer substantial benefits for decoders beyond improving the bit error rate. In this paper, we demonstrate that the sparsity of the equivalent generator matrix of systematic polar codes significantly reduces calculation complexity when using sphere decoding (SD). We propose a fast SD (Fast-SD) for systematic polar codes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed Fast-SD reduces calculation complexity by up to 33.25% compared to SD on short high-rate codes while maintaining maximum likelihood performance."

    "abstract": "Class imbalance remains a significant challenge in healthcare datasets, often leading to biased predictive models that underperform in detecting minority class cases, which are typically of higher clinical importance. While conventional approaches such as Random Over-Sampling (ROS) and Random Under-Sampling (RUS) are commonly applied, they suffer from notable limitations, including potential overfitting caused by duplicate samples in ROS and loss of critical information in RUS due to random removal of majority class instances. To address these shortcomings, this study investigates and compares the effectiveness of two more advanced resampling techniques: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and its hybrid variant SMOTEENN. The Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which exhibits a substantial imbalance between stroke and non-stroke cases, was utilized as the benchmark dataset. TabNet, a deep learning model optimized for tabular data, was employed to evaluate the impact of each resampling method. The model was trained and tuned using randomized search and K-Fold Cross-Validation. Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that SMOTE significantly improves minority class detection compared to the original dataset. However, SMOTEENN outperforms both by enhancing model performance across all evaluation metrics, achieving the highest accuracy (96.17 %), recall (99.05 %), and F1-score <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(96.63 \\%)$</tex>.

    "abstract": "The process of reconstructing quantum states from experimental measurements, accomplished through quantum state tomography (QST), plays a crucial role in verifying and benchmarking quantum devices. A key challenge of QST is to find out how the accuracy of the reconstruction depends on the number of state copies used in the measurements. When multiple measurement settings are used, the total number of state copies is determined by multiplying the number of measurement settings with the number of repeated measurements for each setting. Due to statistical noise intrinsic to quantum measurements, a large number of repeated measurements is often used in practice. However, recent studies have shown that even with single-sample measurements–where only one measurement sample is obtained for each measurement setting–high accuracy QST can still be achieved with a sufficiently large number of different measurement settings. In this paper, we establish a theoretical understanding of the trade-off between the number of measurement settings and the number of repeated measurements per setting in QST. Our focus is primarily on low-rank density matrix recovery using Pauli measurements. We delve into the global landscape underlying the low-rank QST problem and demonstrate that the joint consideration of measurement settings and repeated measurements ensures a bounded recovery error for all second-order critical points, to which optimization algorithms tend to converge. This finding suggests the advantage of minimizing the number of repeated measurements per setting when the total number of state copies is held fixed. Additionally, we prove that the Wirtinger gradient descent algorithm can converge to the region of second-order critical points with a linear convergence rate. We have also performed numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "A highly sensitive intensity modulated Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) interrogation scheme is proposed that integrates compact design with elevated sensitivity and expanded measurement range. The method employs a chirped FBG(CFBG) whose spectral characteristics are tailored through the application of positive and negative temperature gradients. The influence of both positive and negative temperature gradients on the designed CFBG has been systematically investigated. By applying a suitable temperature gradient, the same CFBG structure yields multiple sensitivity levels without altering grating parameters or interrogation methodology. Sensitivity is further boosted by differential interrogation at opposing edges of the FBG reflection spectrum. The proposed approach enables tunable sensitivity spanning from 0.18 dB/με to 1.4 dB/με, while maintaining the same grating structure and interrogation methodology. The proposed technique provides ninefold improvement in sensitivity compared to standard single edge interrogation technique, achieving a high sensitivity of 1.4 dB/με with strain resolution of 0.007 με. The measurement range is expanded by aligning the interrogation wavelengths such that the effective operating regions of the CFBG overlap, enabling continuous strain tracking. The proposed scheme also offers inherent temperature compensation. Owing to its simplicity, tunability, and high sensitivity, the technique is well suited for microstrain and small-amplitude dynamic monitoring applications."

To address the challenge of cooperative node selection in multinode cooperative localization, this study proposes an optimization algorithm for formation grouping in multinode cooperative localization based on the K-means algorithm and the wolf pack algorithm (WPA) (referred to as K-WPA). The algorithm incorporates more practical constraints to guide multinode cluster grouping, thereby improving the efficiency of cluster grouping. In accordance with the clustering results, the population update process of the WPA is optimized to avoid convergence to local optima. By using the Fisher information matrix, the objective function of the WPA is designed, and the optimization process of formation grouping is evaluated. Dynamic grouping simulations are conducted for cooperative systems with 20, 30, and 50 nodes. Results indicate that the proposed K-WPA method improves positioning accuracy by up to 41.24% compared to fixed grouping. Furthermore, the KWPA algorithm combining space division and parallel grouping optimization maintains the average execution time within 1 s for the thousand-node swarm."

    "abstract": "Existing autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilize neither cloud computing for execution of their deep learning-based driving tasks due to the long vehicle-to-cloud communication latency, nor solar energy to offset the energy usage of car-borne computing. They are in general equipped with the resource-constrained edge computing devices which may be unable to execute the compute-intensive deep learning models in real time. The increasing data transmission speed of the commercial mobile networks sheds light upon the feasibility of using the cloud computing for autonomous driving, which is demonstrated by our city-scale real-world measurements over the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. Moroever, the cost and form factor declines of solar harvesting systems make the quest of integrating them with AVs for improving carbon efficiency more promising. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of ECSeg, an edge-cloud switched low-carbon image segmentation system for AVs equipped with roof-mounted solar panels. ECSeg dynamically switches between edge and cloud processing to execute semantic segmentation models in real time while aiming to decarbonize AV computing by maximizing the use of harvested solar energy. The switching decision is challenging due to the complex interdependencies among various factors, including dynamic wireless channel conditions, vehicle motion, visual scene changes, and available renewable energy. To tackle this, ECSeg employs deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal switching policy. Extensive evaluations based on real-world experiments and trace-driven simulations demonstrate that ECSeg outperforms six baseline approaches, achieving 98.8% reduction in computing’s carbon emission, while maintaining high image segmentation accuracy, compared with our earlier design without integrating the solar panel."

DINOv2 outperformed all models, achieving an F1-score of 96.85 % and a ROC-AUC of 99.98 %, followed by surpassing MoCo v2 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(95.83 \\%, 98.35 \\%)$</tex> and SimCLR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(86.42 \\%, 99.35 \\%)$</tex>.

These results suggest that SSL can reduce dependence on labeled data while maintaining robust classification performance and confirm DINOv2 as the most effective method for high-accuracy spoilage detection in this setting."

One promising solution is using High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) tapes or bars in the rotor cage, resulting in induction-synchronous machines. However, this solution still has limited magnetic flux density due to the iron core saturation and requires rotating cryostats. An alternative solution is using HTS stator windings and air-core designs, which enable a static cryostat and higher magnetic flux densities. We analyze the design of different topologies of induction machines with air-core and limited air-core and HTS only in the stator windings, enabling the use of a static cryostat in the stator. Using a 50 kW reference machine, the performance of air-core, limited air-core, and iron-core HTS topologies is evaluated. These are analyzed via finite-element calibrated models for the machine performance and estimation of AC HTS tape losses. Findings revealed that, besides the AC losses, reactive power also plays a crucial role. The best configuration achieved 635 kW, 95.3 % efficiency, and 823 kvar."

The DDE method estimates the leg length and inter step displacement in different gaits through the displacement of the center of plantar pressure (COP) between each phase, and uses them as ES-EKF observations to assist zero velocity update (ZUPT) to correct positioning errors. The experimental results show that the proposed DDE method achieves a relative position accuracy of 0.51%, which decreased by 80.27% compared to the method without using DDE."

Recent works bridge the gap between closed and open-vocabulary recognition by introducing large-scale visual language models such as CLIP with cross-modal alignment capabilities. To preserve multimodal alignment capabilities, it is common to freeze the parameters of the CLIP and then add additional learnable components such as adapters to expand to downstream tasks. However, for the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation task, the plain adapter suffers from overfitting the closed-vocabulary classes and impairs performance on the open-vocabulary unseen classes. In addition, since CLIP is trained to perform image-level alignment can cause the network to over-focus on partially discriminative regions, resulting in incomplete segmentation masks.

To validate its effectiveness, we tested the model using a decade of daily S&P 500 data (2015-2024) and compared its performance against both a traditional ARIMA model and a standard LSTM.

This study uses a unique paradigm that combines the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Task-Technology Fit to look at how these two factors affect students' willingness to use mobile learning apps. This study suggested and tested four hypotheses: 1) Task characteristics (TAC) and technology characteristics (TEC) make TTF better; 2) TTF makes performance expectancy (PE) better; and 3) PE makes user adoption (UA) better. The study employed data from a survey of 100 students using a method called partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that both TAC and TEC made TTF much better. TTF also had a substantial effect on PE, which in turn had an effect on UA. This study's results reveal that TTF plays a function in connecting task-technology aspects with performance goals in mobile learning environments that had not been noticed before. This gives us a new way to look at how technology is used in schools. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that educational app developers should prioritize creating features that align closely with students' specific learning tasks rather than focusing solely on advanced technological capabilities. The significant impact of both task and technology characteristics on task-technology fit indicates that successful mobile learning applications must be designed through thorough user research to understand actual academic workflows and requirements, ensuring that interface design, content delivery methods, and interactive features directly support students' learning activities."

Conventional methods often struggle with CT detection accuracy under varying conditions, leading to relay malfunction. To address these limitations, this article presents a novel analytical approach that models fault current as the sum of three components: a sinusoidal term, a decaying dc term, and a saturation-induced error term. A tailored filter is designed to eliminate the sinusoidal component, enabling precise identification of saturation periods. The proposed method is validated through theoretical analysis, mathematical derivations, and simulations using the Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model in PSCAD, ensuring realistic CT behavior. Real-world fault records and experimental analysis are further utilized to assess the practical performance. Comparative analysis against the existing techniques demonstrates improved accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the suggested method in practical scenarios, with successful operation in both ac and dc saturations identification. By improving CT saturation detection, this research enhances relay performance, reduces protection malfunction, and strengthens power system stability. The proposed approach offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for modern protection schemes, addressing key gaps in the existing methodologies."

Using the ISIC 2019 dataset containing over 25,000 skin lesion images with two main categories (cancerous and non-cancerous), the proposed model is evaluated against several standard CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, Xception, and ConvNeXt Base. Experimental results show that the VGG16 model with dilated convolution achieves the highest classification accuracy (82.9%) and the best F1-score for both cancer (0.843) and non-cancerous (0.814) classes, significantly outperforming the benchmark models. The use of dilated convolutions has been shown to expand the receptive field without increasing model complexity, allowing better multiscale feature extraction, especially for lesions with blurred boundaries. These findings suggest that dilated convolution modifications to classical CNN architectures can be a promising and computationally efficient strategy for deep learning-based skin cancer early detection systems."

    "abstract": "Robust and efficient point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception tasks such as SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous navigation. Traditional methods often rely on fragile point correspondences and iterative optimization, struggling under conditions like poor initialization, partial overlap, and perceptual aliasing. We propose Complex Kernel Registration (CKR), a novel framework that replaces fragile point-level correspondences with a robust alignment of high-level block descriptors. CKR operates by establishing coarse matches between local block descriptors in a high-dimensional complex Hilbert space. CKR extracts compact 8D descriptors capturing both geometric structure and LiDAR reflectance, embeds them via Random Fourier Features, and estimates rigid transformations using Wirtinger gradient descent. This formulation bypasses explicit point matching, yielding fast, accurate, and robust registration, even in cluttered, occluded, and low-texture environments. Extensive experiments on real-world LiDAR datasets demonstrate that CKR outperforms classical and learning-based baselines in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, which is practical for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms without specialized hardware."

Given the critical role of the Traffic Management Center (TMC) in orchestrating this ecosystem, its network infrastructure must be resilient to cyber threats. While prior studies have primarily focused on securing vehicles and roadside units, the detection of unknown cyberattacks targeting the TMC remains largely unexplored, and few studies have utilized real-world datasets for this purpose. This article presents a C-ITS demonstration project deployed in South Korea and proposes Flow Identification for C-ITS (FIC), a lightweight anomaly detection method designed to identify previously unseen cyberattacks on the TMC. FIC compresses large volumes of benign network flows into a compact set of prototype flows. Since unknown attacks are unlikely to conform to these prototypes, abnormal flows can be efficiently detected through simple membership testing - eliminating the need for computationally intensive machine learning models. Experimental results on realworld TMC traffic data demonstrate that FIC effectively detects cyberattack attempts with high accuracy and minimal computational overhead."

    "abstract": "Food price inflation has become a significant global challenge, adversely affecting human well-being and emerging as a key concern within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This inflation is closely linked to the dynamics of the global food price index. Thus, accurately forecasting this index is crucial, particularly when accounting for exogenous factors such as global oil prices. This study aims to predict the global food price index by comparing three analytical approaches: a statistical method (ARIMAX), machine learning methods (Random Forest and XGBoost), and a hybrid approach that integrates both. Parameter estimation was conducted using the Least Squares method for ARIMAX and Grid Search for the machine learning models. The models were evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to assess predictive performance. The results indicate that global oil prices have a significant influence on the food price index. Moreover, the hybrid ARIMAX-XGBoost model demonstrated the best performance, with RMSE and MAPE values of 0.02 and 1.95%, respectively, outperforming each individual approach. These findings highlight that integrating statistical and machine learning techniques enhances prediction accuracy for the food price index influenced by global oil prices, thereby supporting more effective policy decision-making in addressing the impacts of global food inflation."

    "abstract": "Modifying the inverter of line-commutated converter- based high-voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) to hybrid commutated converter (HCC) is currently a highly effective solution for mitigating the risk of commutation failure (CF). This paper investigates the transient performance of HCC from five perspectives while retaining the LCC-HVDC control system. Since constant extinction angle (CEA) controller leads to significant reduction in power transmission, constant voltage (CV) controller is considered a more appropriate choice as the main controller during AC faults. In addition, the extreme case of insufficient forced commutation capacity leading to CF is considered. It is revealed for the first time that the voltage clamping effect of the arrester will cause a new CF phenomenon. There will be no short circuit on the DC side and the fault current is greatly reduced. This leads to insufficient regulation capability of the CV controller, resulting in continuous CFs. Given the limited fault ride-through capability of the selected CV controller, this paper proposes an adaptive order regulation control (AORC) based on expected reactive power. It can adjust the DC current and voltage in a targeted manner according to AC faults, and determine the maximum allowable upper limit of the firing angle. This improves the reliability of HCC in resisting CF. Under extreme cases, it also effectively prevents the continuous CFs. The simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC verify the theoretical analyses and the proposed control method."

Experiments on Quadratic, Least Squares, Logistic Regression, Hinge Loss, and Log–Sum–Exp functions demonstrate robustness across smooth, non-smooth, general, and strongly convex settings.

To promote the application of resource management methods, this paper designs a tracking mode selection scheme (TMSS) for multiple radar systems (MRS), where tracking mode selection adjusts the tracking capabilities of the radar systems by altering their power parameters. The proposed approach primarily formulates an integer optimization model to select suitable tracking modes, thereby changing power resources to enhance the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We first define the discrete tracking modes of radars based on power resources and establish a tracking accuracy evaluation criterion by incorporating these modes into the Bayesian Cramér Rao Lower Bound. By adopting the discrete performance metric, the mode selection problem is constructed as an integer optimization model to balance power consumption with accuracy. A two-step method including relaxation and rounding techniques utilizes the resource utilization characteristics of the various tracking modes to attain efficient solutions to the tracking mode selection problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the TMSS adapts to the discrete tracking modes of MRS, achieving better balance between power resource conservation and solution efficiency."

This incurs cross-link interference from APs operating in DL to APs in UL, and similarly from users operating in UL to users in DL. In this paper, we develop a scalable method for UL-user-to-DL-user interference (UUI) mitigation in dynamic TDD networks. To this end, we note that the UUI observed at each DL user will be predominantly caused by the UL users in its close vicinity. Hence, we propose to form local clusters of UL users for each DL user, including only the UL users that are expected to cause significant UUI to the DL user. Then, we present a graph-coloring-based pilot reuse algorithm that ensures orthogonal pilots among the UL users within the local clusters of each DL user, while maximizing the pilot reuse (i.e., minimizing the pilot length) for scalability. Further, we introduce beamformed DL pilots to estimate effective DL channels (the physical DL channel multiplied by the DL precoding matrix), which together with estimated user-to-user channels enable the multi-antenna DL users to design combining vectors maximizing their signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, by taking both desired signal amplification and UUI suppression into consideration. We derive an achievable DL spectral efficiency with our proposed pilot schemes and combining vectors. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed UUI mitigation scheme, both in terms of pilot overhead reduction and UUI suppression with our designed combining vectors."

However, constructing discriminative feature from scattering of background and distinguishing contour of ship precisely still present challenging subject to the inherent scattering mechanism of SAR. In this article, a dual-branch detection framework with perception of scattering characteristic and geometric contour is introduced to deal with the problem. Firstly, a scattering characteristic perception branch is proposed to fit the scattering distribution of SAR ship through conditional diffusion model, which introduces learnable scattering feature. Secondly, a convex contour perception branch is designed as two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline to delimit the irregular boundary of ship by learning scattering key points. Finally, a cross-token integration module following Bayesian framework is introduced to couple features of scattering and texture adaptively to learn construction of discriminative feature. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on three authoritative SAR datasets for oriented ship detection demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method."

This paper presents a real-time driver behaviour detection system utilizing a multi-modal sensing approach that combines in-vehicle sensors (CAN bus signals, IMU, ADAS perception outputs) with low-cost physiological measurements (heart rate, steering wheel grip force). The proposed framework employs machine learning models to classify and quantify safe, aggressive, and distracted driving behaviours using Gaussian Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for risk-level estimation aligned with accident probability metrics. A comprehensive analysis of feature selection, sensor combinations, and optimal time windows shows that reliable detection can be achieved using 3–12 seconds of driver observation, supporting online deployment. To validate the generalizability of the approach beyond simulation, a custom-built data logger was deployed in real-world controlled driving scenarios that replicated aggressive and distracted behaviours under safe and ethically approved conditions. The models trained solely on simulator data achieved over 92% accuracy in detecting aggressive driving and more than 88% accuracy for distraction detection when applied to real-vehicle data. These results confirm the robustness of the proposed system for practical implementation in driver assistance and telematics applications."

With this regard, we first adopt the pre-defined Lyapunov-like function to derive the control stability condition of the production devices. Then, a constrained optimization problem using the concept of communication and control co-design is formulated to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing the control stability of WNCS. Assuming that the imperfect channel state information is available, we exploit the fractional programming method to transform the control stability constraint into an outage constraint, and propose an alternative algorithm combining Bernstein inequality with first-order convex approximation to design the active beamformer of the controller and passive beamformer of the RIS. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that compared with the existing methods, our proposed scheme can significantly reduce the power consumption, provided that the control stability is guaranteed."

    "abstract": "High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data are ubiquitous in various Big Data-related industrial applications, such as drug innovation and recommender systems. Hash learning is the most efficient representation learning approach to extract hidden information from HDI data owing to its fast reasoning and low storage. However, an existing hash learning approach commonly employs gradient-based optimization techniques to address the discrete objective caused by the binary nature of hash factors, where the Quantization (i.e., quantizing the real values to binary codes) loss is inevitable, resulting in accuracy loss when representing HDI data. Motivated by these critical and vital issues, this paper proposes a non-gradient hash factor (NGHF) model with three-fold ideas: a) innovating a discrete differential evolution (DDE) algorithm able to simulate the continuous optimization via disabling bits of binary codes based on the projected Hamming dissimilarity, thus enabling an effective discrete optimizer, b) applying the proposed DDE algorithm to directly optimize the discrete learning objective of NGHF defined on HDI data, thereby facilitating its efficient and precise training without any Quantization loss, and c) theoretically proving the convergence of NGHF. As such, NGHF possesses high representation learning ability comparable to that of a real-valued model, making it able to achieve precise binary representation to HDI data. Extensive experimental results on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that NGHF significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art hash learning models. Moreover, its accuracy is amazingly comparable to that of a real valued model for HDI data representation learning. Such results are inspiring for facilitating hash-learning models with both high accuracy and fast reasoning on HDI data, which is critical for industrial applications.

For baseband beamforming, the lossy case yields an second-order cone programming-based solution, while the lossless case admits a closed-form solution via maximum ratio transmission. The PAs' positions in both cases are optimized through the Gauss-Seidel-based method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PASS exhibits superior robustness against channel uncertainty compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems. Notably, its worst-case achievable rate can even exceed the fixed-antenna baseline under perfect CSI."

    "abstract": "The integration of sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for energy- and spectrum-efficient 6G networks. Recent studies have revealed that sensing accuracy, achievable rate, and harvested energy inherently exhibit conflicting design requirements and form a nontrivial trade-off region. However, existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) schemes typically optimize at most two of these functionalities and lack a unified resource-allocation framework that can flexibly balance all three under stringent power budgets. Motivated by this gap, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided ISCPT system that employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to support multi-user connectivity. In the proposed design, the RIS reshapes the wireless propagation environment in an energy-efficient manner to enhance both sensing and power transfer, while NOMA provides power-domain multiplexing to improve spectral efficiency and user scalability. We formulate a total transmit power minimization problem by jointly optimizing the base-station beamforming, RIS phase shifts, power splitting (PS) ratios, and NOMA decoding order under quality-of-service (QoS), Cramér–Rao-bound-based sensing accuracy, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly non-convex due to the coupling among the design variables. To solve it efficiently, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm that leverages semidefinite relaxation (SDR), successive convex approximation (SCA), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results verify that the proposed RIS-aided NOMA-ISCPT framework significantly reduces the base-station transmit power while achieving favorable trade-offs among communication reliability, sensing precision, and energy-transfer efficiency."

    "abstract": "Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the AMOS 2022 dataset obtains an average Dice of 85.09%, IoU of 76.66%, ASSD of 19.49 mm, and VOE of 23.34%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation."

The ZTNA significantly enhances the overall security performance of the vehicle fleet. To implement the “never trust, always verify” principle, we first analyze the effects of zero-trust architecture on the communication relationships among intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). Drawing inspiration from human trust dynamics, rules for establishing and reducing trust levels between vehicles are formulated. A variable-directed graph is employed to represent the communication topology of the entire vehicle fleet. Next, a distributed unknown input monitor structure is proposed using known information and verified global state monitoring results from neighboring vehicles with embedded trust levels. By utilizing selectable matrices to process local and global control inputs, any individual vehicle can monitor the state of the entire fleet. Finally, a simulation analysis of a fleet of six vehicle nodes demonstrates the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Specifically, the MAVFL dynamically selects participating vehicles based on their locations and training loss. By incorporating adaptive model sparsification, the proposed scheme dynamically proceeds with sparse masks during vehicle local training, thereby reducing communication overhead while preserving model accuracy. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis to uncover how vehicle mobility and model sparsification affect convergence rate. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem to accelerate the training process, which jointly optimizes vehicle selection, sparsification ratio, and bandwidth allocation to minimize training delay. To solve the problem, we employ the Lyapunov optimization method to decouple the long-term problem into a series of instantaneous subproblems. Next, a generalized Benders decomposition method structures the original problem into a master subproblem for vehicle selection and a primal subproblem for bandwidth allocation and sparsification ratio selection. The optimal solutions are derived via alternating iterations between these problems. Extensive simulation results based on the SUMO simulator demonstrate that the MAVFL accelerates model convergence by up to 14% and reduces communication overhead by up to 26% while preserving model accuracy, as compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Fault detection and diagnosis of bearings are crucial for maintaining the operational integrity of rotating machinery. However, the scarcity of fault samples, particularly for rare faults, leads to severe data imbalance, which consequently degrades model performance and increases false alarm rates. Although deep learning methods have improved diagnostic accuracy, models based on one-dimensional data often struggle to effectively capture the complex spatiotemporal correlation characteristics inherent in bearing faults. To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative data augmentation framework that integrates a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) with Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformation, and presents an intelligent fault diagnosis method for bearings under small-sample conditions. The proposed method first processes vibration signals acquired from a three-channel sensor using the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) algorithm to generate RGB-formatted Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) images. The size of the resulting images is then reduced by employing bicubic interpolation-based downsampling. Subsequently, building upon these prepared samples, we introduce an improved U-Net architecture within the DDPM, designated the IGM-DDPM, which achieves the fusion of deep holistic and salient features to enhance the sample generation process. The quality of the generated samples is evaluated using the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) as a metric. Finally, an improved fault diagnosis model based on EfficientNet-B0 integrated with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is proposed. By refining the number of input channels at each stage, this model mitigates overfitting and improves diagnostic effectiveness. Experimental results from multiple designed validation tests demonstrate that the proposed image enhancement method can effectively improve fault features within the images and maintain satisfactory diagnostic performance."

Then, a novel HOCBF based collision avoidance method is proposed for ASVs modeled by elliptical shapes to reduce conservatism introduced by conventional circular occupancy area assumptions. Finally, local quadratic optimization problems are established for the ASVs such that the robust collision avoidance formation tracking is achieved with minimal deviation from the nominal trajectories.

    "abstract": "Wildfires are natural disasters that cause extensive human casualties and economic losses worldwide. Rapid detection in the early stages is essential to minimize damage; however, conventional supervised learning-based object detection methods face limitations due to the difficulty of acquiring sufficient labeled data for rare wildfire events and their high implementation costs. This study proposes an unsupervised wildfire-detection framework that leverages the characteristics of fixed closed-circuit television (CCTV) environments. The core of the proposed method is a Learnable Concentration Filtering Module that quantifies the spatial distribution differences between wildfire smoke and atmospheric clouds. To extract robust feature representations, we employ ConvNeXt, a modernized convolutional architecture that integrates Vision Transformer design principles to achieve superior performance. Multi-scale features are extracted using a this backbone, and each feature map is divided into fixed 14 × 14 patches. Spatial correlations between patches are learned through local-window self-attention. From the decoder-based reconstruction error map, the concentration ratio defined as the ratio of local maximum to mean values are computed at multiple scales, and concentrated anomaly patterns are selectively extracted through learnable thresholds. Experimental results on four regions of the HPWREN dataset achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.801, average precision (AP) of 0.689, and maximum F1-score (F1-max) of 0.769, demonstrating improved performance over other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models. The proposed method achieved a fast inference time of 10.53 ms, confirming its real-time processing capability. This study presents a practical approach for developing wildfire-detection systems that are robust to environmental variations and do not require labeled data."

    "abstract": "Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are critical components of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), where vehicle-level reliability has a direct bearing on road traffic safety. Evaluating ADS performance in complex environments remains challenging due to the absence of test oracles and the heavy reliance on deep learning. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel metamorphic testing framework tailored for vision-based ADS. First, causal inference is employed to extract key environmental factors from high-dimensional observational traffic data, thereby reducing the test space. Second, a multi-objective optimization algorithm integrating causal counterfactual reasoning is developed to quantify the challenges associated with specific combinations of causal factors, enabling cost-effective exploration of test conditions. Third, low-risk source images are systematically transformed into hazardous driving scenes through a fine-tuned diffusion model, allowing ADS evaluation to be guided by metamorphic relations (MRs). Empirical experiments show that the proposed method achieves a higher fault detection ratio than the strongest baseline in four out of five ADS models, with relative gains ranging from 18.1% to 88.9%. Data augmentation experiments further demonstrate that incorporating MR-violating test cases can reduce ADS prediction errors by up to 13.67%, with these benefits preserved in real-world road traffic datasets through domain adaptation. This study highlights a new pathway for validating the reliability of vision-based ADS driven by deep learning, thereby supporting the deployment of safer road transportation.

A hybrid multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model, combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for criteria weighting and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking, was employed. The tools were assessed based on two primary parameters: technical efficiency (script execution time, test stability, CPU utility, RAM usage) and ease of use (script creation time, programming language support, cross-browser support, cost). The results consistently ranked Selenium WebDriver as the most optimal tool (preference score: 1.0000), primarily due to its superior resource efficiency and high flexibility. Playwright followed (preference scores: 0.8317 & 0.6740), excelling in execution time, while WebDriverIO ranked third (preference score: 0.0000).

The gradiometric configuration provides effective common-mode interference rejection while maintaining a wide dynamic range essential for MRX studies. The developed system demonstrates several key advantages over traditional approaches: it operates at room temperature without requiring cryogenic infrastructure or complex optical components, significantly simplifying experimental setups while improving measurement stability, and works without magnetic shielded environment. Comprehensive testing with magnetic particle samples verified the system’s capability to reliably detect relaxation signals corresponding to iron masses as low as 50 ng. Furthermore, analysis of baseline stability suggests potential for even lower detection limits through optimized signal processing. The system’s robust performance and simplified architecture make it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments where conventional SQUID or OPM systems would be impractical."

    "abstract": "Toxic comments such as hate speech, abusive language, and online bullying appear more and more frequently on digital platforms, threatening the safety of users and online communities. One of the main challenges in multi-label toxic comment classification is data imbalance, where some types of comments appear infrequently, making it difficult to be recognized by the model. This research aims to improve the classification performance by applying Multi-label Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (MLSMOTE) as an oversampling method to balance the label distribution. The dataset used comes from the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge, and the text features are converted into numerical data using TF-IDF. Three machine learning models were tested, namely OneVsRest Logistic Regression, OneVsRest Linear SVC, and MultiOutputClassifier with Random Forest. Evaluation was done using accuracy, precision, recall, and micro F1-score metrics. The results showed that MLSMOTE improved recall and micro F1-score values consistently across all models. The best performance, with a micro F1 score of 0.7474 and a recall of 0.7278, was achieved by the model Random Forest. This demonstrates that oversampling approaches, such as MLSMOTE, are highly effective in addressing data imbalance, enabling more accurate detection of various types of toxic comments. Therefore, this strategy supports the development of automated content moderation systems that are more accurate and fairer in identifying problematic comments."

Emerging approaches, which can enable next-generation wireless communication networks with modest spectrum availability by leveraging flexibility and adaptability rather than sheer array growth, are therefore needed. In this paper, we present a taxonomy framework, referred to as flexible MIMO technology, that systematically categorizes a wide range of evolving MIMO technologies. The focus is on MIMO technologies with flexible physical configurations and integrated applications. We categorize twelve representative flexible MIMO technologies into three major classifications: flexible deployment characteristics-based, flexible geometry characteristics-based, and flexible real-time modifications-based. We then comprehensively overview their fundamental characteristics, potential, and challenges. In addition, we highlight three vital enablers for flexible MIMO technology, including efficient channel state information acquisition schemes, low-complexity beamforming design, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled optimization, and discuss eight representative sub-techniques. Finally, two brief case studies—pre-optimized irregular array for high-speed railway network and cell-free movable antenna—are presented, showing how flexible MIMO can open new design possibilities and inspire future research directions for next-generation wireless networks."

Firstly, a coal mine semantic segmentation dataset (CsSS) comprising 6 mineral categories and 4 foreign object categories was constructed, and MobileSAM-assisted annotation and controllable synthesis were employed to mitigate sample scarcity and category imbalance. Secondly, based on PIDNet, an improved TinyViT backbone was introduced, along with a hierarchical perception multi-scale fusion framework and a dual-attention FusedBlock module, to enhance feature extraction and collaboration between semantic details. For gradient conflict in multi-task learning, a hierarchical gradient pruning strategy integrated with PCGrad was proposed to improve convergence speed and training stability; a differentiated multi-task loss function was also designed to balance optimization objectives. Experimental results show that PVDNet achieves 95.16% mIoU (0.93% higher than the current optimal model) in mineral segmentation, 89.49% mAP (outperforming similar models) in foreign object detection, with only 18.39M parameters and 43.06 FPS inference speed (higher than the fastest existing model). PVDNet outperforms mainstream multi-task models in accuracy and efficiency, showing good industrial deployment potential."

This research presents the design and development of an automated testing script generator that employs a record-and-playback mechanism to streamline the test creation process.

A key innovation lies in leveraging native Flutter widget keys within the embedded recorder, enabling the generation of more stable and maintainable test scripts compared to conventional locator-based approaches. Experimental results indicate that the proposed platform reduces script development time by up to 97.99 % and accelerates regression testing by 14.63 %.

Restricting the total mining power or the number of miners is a possible solution to save computational power consumption. However, reducing the mining power or the number of miners raises concerns about fairness and security. In this paper, we propose a stochastic lightweight blockchain called SLChain in which a random subset of miners is selected to mine the next block. In the proposed SLChain, the power consumption is significantly reduced while maintaining fairness among miners, robustness to multiple types of attacks, and block time consistency. Furthermore, the proposed SLChain can mitigate selfish mining attacks. We derive an analytical model to calculate the rewards earned by selfish miners. Simulations are conducted to study the accuracy of the proposed analytical model. From the numerical results, we found that the profitable threshold of selfish mining attacks increases from 25% to 29.29% in the proposed SLChain. In summary, the proposed stochastic lightweight blockchain can simultaneously reduce computational power consumption, maintain fairness and security levels, ensure block time consistency, and mitigate selfish mining attacks simultaneously."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive glucose monitoring stands as a key pursuit in digital health, aiming to reduce the burden of frequent blood sampling for diabetic individuals. Radio frequency (RF) sensors emerge as promising solutions due to their non-contact nature and sensitivity to dielectric changes. However, their accuracy remains constrained by inconsistent tissue interaction resulting from subject-to-subject variability in skin thickness. In this study, we developed a stepped-line interdigital capacitor (SLIDC)-based RF sensor for anatomically-informed, multi-resonant glucose monitoring at the fingertip. The SLIDC is incorporated with a substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) to ensure compactness for fingertip application, and a Defected Ground Structure (DGS) for enhanced operational bandwidth. The sensor was validated through <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in-vitro</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in-vivo</i> experiments.

Strong mean correlations were seen with glucose concentration, recording |<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>| up to 0.98, and |<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>| up to 0.9 for <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in-vitro</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in-vivo</i> tests respectively.

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) requires the development of a waveform capable of efficiently supporting both communication and sensing functionalities. This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the Chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance."

    "abstract": "Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) enables users to search encrypted data stored on an untrusted server without revealing any sensitive information. However, existing PEKS schemes are typically inefficient and lack the flexibility to support complex search policies. To address this, a novel PEKS scheme based on Arithmetic Span Programs (PEKS-ASP) is proposed in this paper. This is the first scheme to enable flexible and efficient search policies by using directed acyclic graphs. This approach enhances the efficiency of complex search queries that implement AND, OR, and NOT gates, enabling a more efficient representation of complicated search policies without redundancy in keyword usage. And our proposed PEKS-ASP scheme guarantees constant-size public parameters regardless of the number of keywords. Additionally, the proposed scheme achieves adaptive security under the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption, employing dual system encryption techniques. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PEKS-ASP significantly improves efficiency and practicality, making it well-suited for practical applications in various cloud environments."

Given these notable advantages, NearLink has great potential for widespread application in various Internet of Things (IoT) areas. However, NearLink-based wireless sensing has not yet been explored. To bridge this gap, this work explores for the first time the sensing potential and opportunities of NearLink. Specifically, we systematically investigate the sensing capability of NearLink through answering two key questions: (1) How can NearLink's communication-oriented signals be adapted for sensing tasks? (2) How can sensing performance be enhanced under multipath interference and low-power constraints? We prototype the NearLink sensing system-NearSense, and take the respiration detection as a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NearSense can achieve an average detection rate of 98% and a false alarm rate below 1.5% in case of various real-life challenging interference. We believe this work opens up new directions for the new-generation wireless sensing towards high-quality network connections."

    "abstract": "The active power decoupling technique is a promising solution for grid-connected converters under unbalanced grid conditions due to its advanced merits in simultaneously achieving negative-sequence current elimination and active power ripple suppression. However, an extra power decoupling circuit, along with a complex power ripple tracking controller, should be designed for these purposes. Given this, this article proposes an autonomous power ripple suppression scheme that achieves both active power ripple suppression and negative-sequence current elimination based on a grid-connected multiport converter. In the proposed scheme, negative-sequence current elimination is implemented at the ac port, and the dc-port power is controlled to be constant to suppress active power ripples. Thus, the differential power ripples are autonomously buffered by the ripple port. Besides, the multiport converter is decomposed into an upper-port converter and a lower-port converter to ease the modulation design under time-varying dc-link voltages. With the proposed scheme, balanced three-phase grid currents and ripple-free dc output voltage are simultaneously obtained under unbalanced grid conditions without extra power ripple controllers. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

To address this, we propose a data-driven method to model the dynamics of deformable objects. Our method utilizes time-series data to predict future states without relying on complex dynamics. We employ model predictive control (MPC) for robot manipulation and improve its performance through online updates of the data-driven model. To handle cables with varying configurations, interpolation is applied to align model input structures. In this study, we focus on manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) with different mechanical properties and configurations using a dual-arm robotic system, both in simulation and in real-world environments."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently attracted wide attentions in various areas such as 3D navigation, Virtual Reality (VR) and 3D simulation, due to its photorealistic and efficient rendering performance. High-quality reconstrution of 3DGS relies on sufficient splats and a reasonable distribution of these splats to fit real geometric surface and texture details, which turns out to be a challenging problem. We present GeoTexDensifier, a novel geometry-texture-aware densification strategy to reconstruct high-quality Gaussian splats which better comply with the geometric structure and texture richness of the scene. Specifically, our GeoTexDensifier framework carries out an auxiliary texture-aware densification method to produce a denser distribution of splats in fully textured areas, while keeping sparsity in low-texture regions to maintain the quality of Gaussian point cloud. Meanwhile, a geometry-aware splitting strategy takes depth and normal priors to guide the splitting sampling and filter out the noisy splats whose initial positions are far from the actual geometric surfaces they aim to fit, under a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Validation of Depth Ratio Change</i> checking. With the help of relative monocular depth prior, such geometry-aware validation can effectively reduce the influence of scattered Gaussians to the final rendering quality, especially in regions with weak textures or without sufficient training views. The texture-aware densification and geometry-aware splitting strategies are fully combined to obtain a set of high-quality Gaussian splats. We experiment our GeoTexDensifier framework on various datasets and compare our Novel View Synthesis results to other state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, with detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing more photorealistic 3DGS models."

The problem of marine fish recognition and classification is complex and multidimensional, encompassing biological challenges such as species similarity, data quality, feature extraction, and computational limitations. Effective solutions require a multidisciplinary approach, the integration of advanced technologies, and collaboration between marine biologists and computer scientists.

    "abstract": "In symmetric α-stable (SαS)-distributed impulsive noise, classical direction of arrival (DOA) estimators degrade markedly due to heavy-tailed statistics. To address this, we propose an adaptive, gridless DOA method for coprime arrays. First, we design a condition-selection phased fractional lower-order moment scheme that determines the fractional order by minimizing the condition number, thereby accommodating varying noise intensities without prior knowledge of the characteristic index α. Then, leveraging the virtual uniform linear array formed by the coprime difference coarray, we establish a covariance-matching gridless sparse reconstruction framework to estimate DOAs, eliminating angular grid mismatch and internalizing regularization selection within a constrained optimization, thus avoiding manual tuning. Numerical simulations indicate that, across a broad range of generalized signal-to-noise ratios, snapshot counts, and noise intensities, the proposed method delivers overall gains in estimation accuracy and resolution over existing approaches. Real-world validation using a millimeter-wave radar sensor further verifies its detection performance and practical utility."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has increased the demand for robust authentication protocols capable of handling vehicle-node dynamics and resisting attacks. Traditional centralized methods, which suffer from latency and single-point failure issues, cannot meet IoV's real-time requirements. Although distributed authentication improves scalability and responsiveness, existing approaches still confront challenges regarding stability and reliability in dense vehicular networks due to static trust mechanisms and inefficient cryptographic operations. To address these challenges, we propose a Cybertwin-Enabled Distributed Authentication (CEDA) scheme that leverages lightweight cryptography and Cybertwin technology to reconstruct the authentication framework featuring dynamic trust distribution and real-time behavioral analytics. Specifically, CEDA establishes virtual digital twins of vehicles to enable real-time behavior tracking and dynamic simulation, thus enabling data-driven selection of vehicle agents based on real-time behavioral similarity. This mechanism reduces dependence on centralized trusted authorities by distributing trust across a network of dynamically selected agents, thereby enhancing fault tolerance and resilience against attacks. Furthermore, CEDA integrates an Edwards-curve-based digital signature algorithm to streamline cryptographic computations, significantly reducing authentication latency while strengthening security. A dynamic agent selection mechanism based on real-time vehicle behavior similarity further ensures efficient authentication in high-density vehicular environments. Comprehensive security analysis confirms the robustness of CEDA against a wide range of potential attacks, thus safeguarding the integrity of the IoV ecosystem. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in authentication efficiency and system scalability, particularly in scenarios involving frequent inter-regional vehicle authentications."

    "abstract": "As various communication methods evolve, the demand for communication services has surged. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), due to their flexibility and low cost, have emerged as ideal platforms for providing convenient communication services. However, traditional centralized algorithms consume significant resources under limited communication capacity, while distributed algorithms often struggle to achieve effective collaboration. To address this challenge, this study proposes a multiagent federated reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm aimed at optimizing the deployment and resource allocation of multi-UAV to enhance network utility. The approach employs personalized proximal federated learning, allowing each agent to learn and train independently based on local observations, while periodically uploading model parameters to a central server. The central server maintains a global model and returns updated parameters with proximal terms, thereby improving cooperation among agents while reducing communication overhead. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates a reward network competition mechanism locally to provide effective target values for model training. To thoroughly validate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness, a multi-UAV environment is constructed that comprehensively accounts for signal interference and transmission loss. Simulation results demonstrate that, across various complex environments, this algorithm outperforms traditional methods in terms of network utility."
