    "abstract": "The fusion of optical and SAR remote sensing imagery has become increasingly crucial for accurate multi-label remote sensing scene classification (MRSSC), which plays an essential role in producing reliable land use and land cover (LULC) products. However, visual heterogeneity between optical and SAR data, together with the speckle noise inherent in SAR imagery, greatly limits the performance of existing multimodal fusion approaches. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Frequency-Domain Progressive Fusion Network (FDPFNet) that adopts a hybrid CNN–Transformer architecture to serve as an effective and unified multimodal backbone for MRSSC. First, a Low-Frequency Convolution (LFConv) block is introduced, utilizing wavelet transform to highlight low-frequency components shared across modalities while suppressing high-frequency noise in SAR data. Second, a Two-Frequency Decomposition (TFD) block is designed to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, allowing comprehensive fusion of modality-shared low-frequency semantics while mitigating the adverse effects of inconsistent high-frequency details. Finally, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) block is developed to dynamically balance intra-modal feature consistency and inter-modal complementarity across multiple hierarchical levels, thereby achieving more effective optical–SAR fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on the BigEarthNet-MM and SEN12-MLRS datasets demonstrate that FDPFNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed module and the overall architecture."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a robust methodology for resilient consensus in complex nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). While substantial work has been done on resilient consensus using the mean-subsequent reduced (MSR) algorithm, challenges remain, particularly when considering communication time-delays and bounded disturbances in linear and nonlinear systems. To address these issues, we introduce a novel variable transformation that reformulates the resilient output consensus problem with delayed and sampled output data, into a continuous-time regulation problem. This transformation enables the extension of the weighted-MSR (W-MSR) algorithm to settings with bounded disturbances and variable time-delays. A key innovation is the incorporation of a drift term in the W-MSR update ensuring bounded system evolution under persistent disturbances. Using this transformation, a distributed controller is then proposed for agents in Euler-Lagrange form with unknown nonlinearities, disturbances and state delays that achieves consensus under adversarial attacks, utilizing only delayed and sampled measurements of neighbor outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology through simulations of a group of underactuated robotic vehicles."

    "abstract": "This systematic analysis explores the integration of blockchain-based trust management frameworks within crowdfunding platforms, focusing on their ability to resolve key issues such as fraud, lack of transparency, and limited accountability. Crowdfunding, which relies on trust between funders and project creators, is often undermined by centralized control and information asymmetry. Blockchain technology offers a compelling alternative with its inherent decentralized structure and capacity for automated enforcement. This study critically examines how smart contracts, decentralized identity systems, and trust scoring mechanisms based on blockchain can reinforce trust and enhance security in crowdfunding environments. The findings highlight that blockchain enables more reliable verification processes, tamper-proof transaction records, and automated contract enforcement, all of which contribute to increased stakeholder confidence. Despite these advantages, challenges such as legal uncertainties, technical barriers, scalability issues, and adoption resistance continue to hinder full-scale implementation. The analysis also considers ethical and regulatory implications, emphasizing the need for robust governance and interoperable frameworks to support long-term viability. Ultimately, blockchain has the potential to redefine the trust architecture of crowdfunding platforms by fostering greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, offering a foundation for more secure and effective fundraising ecosystems in the digital age."

    "abstract": "Chest radiographs are widely used to clinically diagnose thoracic diseases such as lung opacity, pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 due to their cost-effectiveness and easy access. However, accurate interpretation remains challenging because of overlapping anatomical structures, low contrast, and subtle disease manifestations. Classical deep learning models are effective but often exhibit overfitting, and weak interpretability, which restricts their clinical applicability. This paper presents an attention-driven hybrid framework that integrates contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization-based enhancement with a dual-backbone architecture combining a vision transformer and a residual network. The vision transformer captures global contextual dependencies, while the residual network extracts local discriminative features. The concatenated representations are classified using a multi-layer perceptron and optimized end-to-end with the AdamW optimizer and a step learning rate scheduler. To improve transparency, gradient-weighted class activation mapping is used to highlight disease-relevant regions in chest radiographs. Experimental evaluation highlights that the proposed framework achieves 98.54% classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models, including EfficientNet 96.20%, DenseNet 97.50%, and a fine-tuned vision transformer 95.79%. To ensure generalizability, cross-dataset validation was conducted and trained on COVID-19 Radiography Dataset. The same model was tested on an independent COVID–Pneumonia–Normal chest X-ray dataset which achieved an accuracy of 94.07% and demonstrated good performance over heterogeneous imaging sources. These findings confirm the proposed framework’s robustness, interpretability, and suitability for real-time clinical decision support in both pandemic and routine diagnostic settings."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for data-efficient black-box robot learning under constraints. Our approach integrates probabilistic inference with Lagrangian optimization. With the guide of a learned Gaussian process model, the Lagrange multiplier is controlled by the probability of whether the constraints would be satisfied. This reduces the typical oscillations seen in primal-dual updates and therefore improves both data efficiency and safety during learning. Both synthetic results and robot experiments demonstrate that our method is a scalable and effective solution for constrained robot learning problems."

    "abstract": "Although haptic technologies that allow users to touch virtual objects have been actively researched in the academic field of haptics, they are not yet widely adopted in real-world applications. To promote broader adoption, designing haptic stimuli that elicit pleasant sensations is essential since hedonic motivation significantly drives user acceptance. However, how such pleasantness can be effectively induced through haptic stimulation during a user's active exploration remains an open question. Furthermore, it is unclear whether “pseudo-haptics”, a low-cost substitute for physical force feedback, can also serve effectively in this affective context. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the applied force during user actions and the resulting pleasantness, using a bow-dragging and arrow-shooting scenario as a case study. Specifically, we conducted three psychophysical experiments to investigate two types of force feedback. One type was a physical force that stimulated the kinesthetic sense, and the other was a pseudo force induced through visual manipulation. Our results revealed that pleasantness tended to be elicited when physical resistance force was present during bow dragging, whereas this tendency was not observed for pseudo resistance force. While there has been a general assumption that pseudo-haptics can replace physical stimuli to some extent in the rendering of haptic properties, our findings quantitatively show that in our case the two are not interchangeable for eliciting positive affect. We also found that the arrow's flying speed contributed to pleasantness as much as the physical resistance force, suggesting that pleasantness is influenced postdictively. Moreover, across all experiments, perceived pleasantness was strongly correlated with the perceived naturalness of the bow-and-arrow behavior. These findings provide valuable insights for designing pleasant interactions involving continuous force feedback, highlighting the distinct roles of physical and pseudo-haptic cues."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of channel estimation in millimeter-wave movable antenna systems. Unlike previous methods solely based on sparsity, we propose a channel estimation method that simultaneously exploits both the sparsity in the angular domain and the low-rank structure of the channel. Specifically, by leveraging these properties, the channel estimation problem is formulated as a matrix completion problem, where sparsity is promoted by incorporating ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-norm term in the objective function and the low-rank structure is enforced via a rank constraint. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the minimum number of samples required for channel matrix recovery and propose a two-stage sampling method. To handle the non-smooth ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-norm term, we apply its subgradient method. To address the non-convex low-rank constraint, we adopt a retraction-free descent algorithm with a rank reduction to construct a search direction on the restricted tangent cone and determine the optimal rank. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method for channel estimation with limited samples significantly outperforms existing methods."

Singular value decomposition (SVD)-based schemes provide near-optimal performance but incur prohibitive computational cost, whereas QR decomposition (QRD)-based schemes offer hardware-friendly but cannot support power allocation. This letter proposes a novel sorted QRD (SQRD)-based scheme, retaining the low complexity of QRD while enabling power allocation. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to the SVD benchmark, offering a low-complexity and hardware-friendly solution for next-generation Wi-Fi."

A systematic electrical characterization demonstrated that IL scavenging reduces the operating voltage and initial interface traps while mitigating interface trap generation and ferroelectric fatigue induced by stress cycling, thereby improving memory window (MW) recovery capability. In addition, by investigating the frequency of recovery pulses under iso-time conditions, we found that lower frequencies are favorable for complete MW recovery. Our findings offer a valuable understanding of the degradation and recovery mechanisms in FeFETs, underscoring the critical role of recovery speed and controlled IL."

    "abstract": "Most experts contend that achieving resilience to hybrid warfare (HW), the synergetic blend of conventional and unconventional warfighting, requires sharpening of the West's technological edge. Of all technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) receives the most attention with specialists asserting that AI has strategic-level implications for HW. Meanwhile, one much less-examined factor in the technology discussions on HW is data. The lack of research on data is surprising, given the consensus on the critical role of AI in HW. At a minimum, from a technical perspective, one cannot train AI models without robust datasets. At a maximum, if hybrid actors can abuse siloed data systems to disrupt critical functions, then the West requires robust data governance to counter HW. This article thus asks how the data challenges of achieving resilience to HW could be sustainably resolved. The objective is: (i) to analyze the data challenges of tackling HW; (ii) to offer a working framework to resolve them. The text combines defense studies with latest insights from data science to argue that data spaces (DS), a novel data governance model, are uniquely qualified to resolve the data challenges of resilience. DS are trusted interoperable data sharing ecosystems that can supercharge national and international collaboration. DS can thus lead to enhanced detection and foresight of hybrid operations, more robust legislation and innovation cycles, and an overall paradigm shift toward data-driven resilience to HW."

Many car manufacturers and their suppliers have funded different software systems to fulfill the driving requirements. By the growing number of innovations, the rapidly changing technology and newer players in the automotive industry requires academy and industry to collaborate on their automated software developments. To do so, a common research and development framework is needed which inherently provides smooth transition of new solutions from one world to the other. Even though there are many open source research framework for rapid prototyping of automated driving functions, these solutions are often concentrated on low speed maneuvering, especially for the higher automation levels, such as robo-taxis. However, major automotive companies require developments of up to SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) level 2 and 3. Therefore, a new prototypical, open source software architecture<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> is proposed, that uses well-known tools and technology as basis, such as Robot Operating System or Autoware Universe, but also being closely in compliance with industrial architecture aspects.

    "abstract": "The security of women in private indoor settings— including dormitories, restrooms, and bedrooms—continues to be a significant challenge. Conventional safety solutions, such as mobile phones or wearable devices, are frequently ineffective in emergencies where silent and discreet communication is paramount. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a vision-based system powered by artificial intelligence for the real-time identification of emergency hand gestures, tailored for use in privacy-sensitive locations. Our proposed methodology utilizes MediaPipe's 21-point hand landmark model in conjunction with a computationally efficient rule-based classifier. This classifier is designed to identify two distinct gestures: the internationally recognized SOS signal (characterized by the sequence: open palm, followed by a thumb tuck, culminating in a closed fist) and a newly defined gesture wherein the index finger makes contact with the center of the opposite palm. To enhance reliability, a spatial-temporal validation component assesses the intent behind the gesture by examining the geometric relationships of the landmarks and the consistency of motion across consecutive video frames, thereby substantially reducing false alarms. The entire processing pipeline is implemented locally using OpenCV, which guarantees user privacy and achieves a processing latency of under 150 milliseconds. Experimental results indicate that the system attains an accuracy exceeding 95% across diverse lighting scenarios, confirming its robust real-time performance on standard consumer-grade hardware. This research offers a practical, cost-efficient, and privacy-centric framework for silent emergency alerting, thereby contributing to the advancement of AI-driven safety applications for women in enclosed private spaces."

The analysis focuses on the Nakhchivan region, which offers strong solar resource potential. We formalize a relation that links the firm night-time demand to available TES capacity and a predefined battery block, and evaluate two representative configurations under a common dispatch policy. In both cases, PV supplies daytime demand, the CSP unit stores midday solar heat for later use, and the BESS (500 MW) manages ramps and short-term fluctuations. The first configuration is a larger-scale option intended to deliver <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 5 0 M W}$</tex> of firm power, supported by approximately 450 MW of PV, about 300 MW of CSP, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 14 \\mathrm{h}$</tex> of TES.

This presents a simple and cost-effective method for retrieving an object's vibration information compared to previous microDoppler extraction techniques. This method is easily implementable in a continuous Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) monitoring campaign which would increase the measurement's capability from only monitoring displacement per acquisition to also monitoring the object's vibration which could increase its usefulness for infrastructure health monitoring applications."

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the influence of distance-based clustering on the performance of Ensemble Learning models for cellular signal prediction. The methodology involved collecting drive test and operator data, followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering. The data was then clustered by distance using Quantile Binning and Fixed Interval methods. Various ensemble models were evaluated across three modeling scenarios: a specific model per cluster, a global model (baseline), and a global model with an added cluster feature. The results consistently demonstrate that the global model (baseline) approach delivered the most accurate and robust performance, with the Stacking model achieving the best results (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.80). The initial hypothesis, which stated that prediction error would increase with distance, was definitively rejected. In-depth analysis revealed that the error peaked at mid-range distances (100-250 meters), attributed to the high volatility of the actual signal in complex local environments like urban canyons. This finding proves that unmodeled local environmental factors have a more dominant influence on prediction difficulty than signal attenuation due to distance alone, offering the insight that more detailed geospatial features are needed to improve model accuracy in the future."

Art generation based on text-to-image prompts has been researched since 2015 with the development of Align Draw and has only grown since, with one of the most commonly known models being Stable Diffusion, a generative AI model based on Latent Diffusion Model. Stable Diffusion is trained by feeding images as training data into the model, where they are gradually reduced to pure noise, and then go through a reverse diffusion process where the noises are converted back into their initial states. In this paper, the process of diffusion model training in Stable Diffusion will be explained more thoroughly and applied to the training of a model to generate a specific building type. The model training itself took 7 minutes to complete all 10 epochs and a total of 240 steps. The loss during each epoch was shown. The loss peaked at epoch 8 at 18.3% but went down significantly at epoch 9 to only be at 13.8%. With the loss during training to be less than 20% at most, it is feasible to assume that the image generated by the model will hopefully be similar to the real thing."

A map of science and practice is provided, illustrating the relationship between key concepts such as science, engineering, education, and scientific results, all of which are essential for the creative activities of scientists, students, and engineers. A map of model minimization, its pros and cons for verification procedures, is given modelling for simulation. It is shown that to perform verification successfully, it is necessary to meet the requirements of testable standards to reduce the time for modeling and simulation procedures. To do this, it is essential to redesign (remodel) the digital product to maximize the enlargement of the logical elements of the new circuit model. A vector-matrix technology is presented for building a map to test functions and structures without relying on algorithms or processor instructions. Mechanisms for rendering any structure, function, truth table, and matrix using graph construction for any logical vector are given. Structurally logical constants are determined, enabling the solution of the problem of modeling a testing map for functionality or structure in a more technologically advanced manner."

To address this, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used for feature interaction analysis, extracting key decomposed features such as PauliRGB, Cloude-Pottier, and van Zyl, which were combined into a multi-dimensional PolSAR feature cube. This served as input to the proposed feature-enhanced multiattention Dual U-Net (FMD-Unet), which integrates multiple attention modules for end-to-end, pixel-wise classification. Experiments on quad-polarization NASA/JPL AIRSAR L-band benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FMD-Unet, achieving a test accuracy of 99.89 percent across 15 classes. The model is computationally efficient, requiring under 3 hours for 1000 training epochs. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art architecture, including dual-branch PSPNet, FCN, DeepLabv3Plus, and USquareNet, confirm its superior classification performance. Furthermore, the model's flexibility allows it to function as a plug-and-play component for PolSAR classification tasks, enhancing its adaptability.

Our research focuses on algal blooms in Lake Windermere, England, and the Haiderpur wetlands in Muzaffarnagar-Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, India. Using high-resolution satellite data gathered during August and September 2024, we investigate the characterization of BGA, MCI, and NDCI for Lake Windermere and the same period for the Haiderpur wetlands. Pre-processing steps specifically to extract water-leaving reflectance calculations were adopted using Sen2Corr and ACOLITE for both Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Landsat 8 (OLI). This conversion from TOA data to surface reflectance is crucial for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, leveraging methods such as empirical indices, BDA, NDCI, and FAI. The result highlights the application of water quality proxies, including chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, FAI and turbidity, to assess the quality of inland lake and wetland designated site. With the help of the water quality package, integrating high resolution UAV imagery and related literature, researchers and water managers may improve water quality monitoring and make well-informed decisions more easily.

For its diagnostic purposes, a chest radiograph is commonly used to identify the affected regions (lesions). The manual diagnosis of pneumothorax has been challenging due to image variability in terms of contrast and uniformity in radiographs. Hence, to address this issue, we present TGAPneumoSeg, a Noval deep learning architecture that helps in pneumothorax diagnosis through improved chest X-ray interpretation. The model addresses these challenges by using an architecture that combines multi-scale attention mechanisms, text-guided embedding fusion, and a two-stage progressive denoising attention (PDA) process. We used the SIIMACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset to train our model TGAPneumoSeg achieving Dice score of 0.8394 and a Jaccard index of 0.8198, outperforming established models like U-Net, ResNet34 U-Net, Attention U-Net and PTXSeg-Net pretrained on ImageNet. The model integrates textual embeddings with visual features, which ensures precise lesion boundary detection while maintaining clinical relevance. Further experimental results demonstrate robustness and adaptability of TGAPneumoSeg improving patient care through faster and more accurate diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Adult education faces the challenges of fragmented learning time, diverse resources, and limited device performance, which restrict the effective deployment of intelligent learning systems. To address these issues and support Quality Education within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this paper proposes EduLite-CNN, a multi-strategy lightweight convolutional neural network optimized for adult education scenarios. The model integrates depth wise separable convolution, Ghost modules, and a lite attention mechanism to enhance feature representation while significantly reducing computational cost. Furthermore, pruning, quantization-aware training, and knowledge distillation are applied to achieve high efficiency and compactness without compromising accuracy. Experiments on multi-modal datasets including textbooks, lecture slides, handwritten notes, and classroom behavior images demonstrate that EduLite-CNN outperforms representative lightweight baselines in resource classification, behavior detection, and layout segmentation, achieving both higher accuracy and lower latency on mobile devices. The findings confirm that EduLite-CNN provides a feasible and scalable solution for intelligent education applications, promoting the accessibility and sustainability of adult learning systems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Electromagnetic coilguns are increasingly recognized as a promising alternative to conventional projectile launch systems due to their ability to deliver high velocities through contactless acceleration. Among various configurations, reluctance-based coilguns are particularly affected by the issue of armature capture, where residual coil current continues to exert a retarding magnetic force after the projectile passes the optimal acceleration point. This undesired effect significantly reduces the projectile’s exit velocity and overall efficiency. Conventional mitigation techniques— typically employing SCR-based switching to abruptly interrupt current—often lead to substantial energy losses and offer limited flexibility in control. In response, this study introduces a novel pulse-width modulation strategy that employs IGBT or MOSFET switches to precisely regulate coil excitation. By tuning the switching frequency and duty cycle, the coil current is shaped to decay at the exact moment the projectile exits the magnetic influence zone, thereby minimizing reverse forces without dissipating stored magnetic energy. A digital twin of a reluctance coilgun is developed and simulated using ANSYS Maxwell and Twin Builder platforms to evaluate the proposed method. Simulations at charging voltages of 400 V, 500 V, and 600 V revealed a pronounced reverse force in each case, significantly degrading launch efficiency. To counter this, the SCR was replaced with an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), and the coil was driven using a 500 Hz switching frequency with a duty cycle of 0.8. This configuration effectively suppressed the reverse force and maintained the projectile’s velocity near its maximum across all tested voltages, confirming the practicality and efficiency of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "The rising demand for Home Health Care (HHC) makes its operational efficiency a critical issue. The HHC routing and scheduling problem is a complex, multiobjective combinatorial optimization challenge that aims to balance conflicting goals, including minimizing travel distance, maximizing skill matching, and ensuring punctuality. To tackle this NP-hard problem, this paper proposes the Adaptive Decomposed Proximal Policy Optimization (ADPPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework. The core of AD-PPO is the integration of a decomposition strategy into a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent. This breaks the problem into a set of directionally-focused subproblems guided by reference vectors. The key innovation is its adaptive mechanism: the agent dynamically evaluates the current solution’s position in the objective space and selects the most relevant reference vector to guide policy improvement adaptively. This allows the agent to focus its efforts on the most critical performance weaknesses intelligently. Extensive experiments on HHC benchmark instances demonstrate that AD-PPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in terms of both convergence and the quality of the obtained Pareto front, offering an effective new paradigm for complex scheduling problems."

This restricts researchers' ability to study the impact of retrieval settings on model performance. PaSSER addresses this issue by enabling the systematic variation of retrieval parameters while ensuring reproducible results. The platform integrates three key components. A web-based interface supports both normal and score retrieval modes with configurable similarity thresholds. A computational backend aggregates eleven evaluation metrics into a weighted composite performance score. Blockchain-based logging ensures that parameter settings and results are immutable and can be verified independently. A controlled evaluation using the Mistral 7B model demonstrates the platform's capability. Two similarity thresholds (0.85 vs. 0.55) were compared on a domain-specific dataset. The evaluation reveals measurable differences between lexical precision and semantic breadth approaches. The scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating the functionality of the platform. Blockchain integration provides tamper-proof experimental records. This addresses the challenge of reproducibility in RAG research, where parameter variations can significantly impact results, yet are often inadequately documented. Future development will focus on automated parameter exploration, expanded metric libraries, additional model integrations, and multi-domain dataset management to support larger-scale comparative studies."

Currently, emulsion homogeneity is checked by taking samples for analysis. This process takes time and requires additional human resources. This paper describes a technical solution for emulsion homogeneity monitoring. It consists of turbidity sensors mounted in existing emulsion storage tanks, an electronic module, and corresponding measuring instruments. An experimental setup was developed to test the metrological characteristics of the turbidity sensors using standard kaolin suspension samples. Experiments have shown that turbidity sensors have an extensive measuring range, high sensitivity, and a close-to-linear transfer function. Using turbidity sensors allows for monitoring the stages of emulsion breakdown, such as sedimentation, coalescence, and complete separation into two liquids. Fixing the moment of emulsion breakdown in real-time makes it possible to apply three different modes to restore emulsion homogeneity by repeated mixing at different time intervals. It will significantly reduce the time to restore the homogeneity of the water-fuel emulsion."

A particularly transformative development is the rise of agentic AI, autonomous, goal-driven, and adaptive systems capable of reasoning and acting independently in dynamic environments. These technologies are becoming powerful drivers of innovation in the e-commerce and retail sectors, fundamentally reshaping how businesses engage with consumers and manage operations. One critical area in retail is customer satisfaction and brand trust, where online reviews serve as a key post-purchase feedback channel. Despite a benchmark maximum response rate of 69%, at least 30-40% of reviews remain unanswered, negatively impacting customer satisfaction and trust. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven solution designed to enhance the speed, efficiency, and quality of responses to negative customer reviews. Our approach outperforms current manual, automated, and semi-automated methods, offering a scalable and effective tool for improving customer engagement and brand perception. This solution is intended to assist product quality and customer experience teams, not to replace them, by augmenting their capabilities with intelligent automation."

    "abstract": "The very fast digitalization of electrical systems has brought remarkable opportunities and significant risks. Infrastructures that were once largely isolated are now significantly interconnected, relying on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) platforms, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, and cloud-based services. Considering this transformation has improved efficiency and flexibility, it has also broadened the attack surface available to malicious actors. Highprofile incidents over the past decade, such as the Stuxnet worm in 2010, the cyberattacks on Ukraine's power grid in 2015-2016, and the SolarWinds supply chain compromise in 2020, have exposed the vulnerability of power systems to sophisticated threats. This paper explores resilience and vulnerability as two complementary aspects of protecting electrical infrastructures. Vulnerabilities are examined from many perspectives, such as technical, organizational, and supply-chain, while resilience is understood as the ability to anticipate, withstand, and recover from many disruptive events. More particular attention is given to emerging approaches, including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, the use of microgrids for redundancy, and the role of cross-border regulatory frameworks. The discussion is highlighting the need for a holistic approach that combines technology, governance, and international cooperation. Such approach is essential for building adaptable, flexible infrastructures that are capable of maintaining energy security in an increasingly complex and uncertain threat landscape. The major importance of this work is that it brings together cybersecurity and engineering perspectives, showing how real incidents are translated into measurable impacts on power systems and suggesting practical ways such as AI based monitoring and digital twin models, to empower their resilience."

    "abstract": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a cornerstone of quantitative research, providing the foundation for uncovering descriptive statistical patterns and preparing data for inferential modeling. While descriptive statistics and visualizations are well-established, the methodological bridge between descriptive and inferential analysis-association measures-remains complex. Different correlation measures must be selected depending on data types, and issues such as significance testing, spurious associations, and the exponential growth of pairwise comparisons in large datasets present significant challenges. Existing R functions such as cor.test() and cor() (base R), as well as rcorr() (Hmisc) and correlation() (easystats), each offer partial solutions. However, these functions are either limited to pairwise outputs, lack significance filtering, or introduce dependencies on external packages, which constrains their usability for large-scale exploratory tasks. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a prototype algorithm implemented exclusively in base $\\mathbf{R}$. The algorithm is capable of compactly reporting results, returning structured outputs suitable for further processing, and filtering associations based on statistical significance. By accepting flexible parameter ranges, it reduces the computational burden of testing all possible variable pairs, focusing only on theoretically meaningful relationships. Although the current version is a prototype, essential future developments include handling missing values, validating user-defined intervals, expanding support to multiple association measures, and enabling automated result export. This contribution provides a scalable, extensible framework that enhances the efficiency and interpretability of association analysis, offering researchers a practical tool for managing complex, high-dimensional datasets."

Methods: To make the antenna work in the ultra-wideband frequency range of 2 to 13 GHz the microstrip antenna of round shape is considered for the design. A circular slot in the antenna is made to obtain the desired operating frequency in the ultrawideband range. Along with obtaining the desired operating frequency it is important to obtain the gain the frequency range. So to do so the antenna array structure is considered. To reduce the burden of input signaling a single but unique inset fed power divider is considered to feed signal to the antenna. Findings: In this study, a circular slot-shaped antenna array is suggested. The suggested antenna has an ultrawide band frequency range of operation. Antennas with a circular shape provide lower return loss, higher gain, and greater directivity. The array’s primary purpose is to increase the antenna’s gain. The antenna is created using the inset feed approach. Design formulae are used to establish the size and feed method. The simulation findings demonstrate an excellent return loss (reflection coefficient) of -40 dB, which is well below the benchmark of 10 dB, and an estimated 8 GHz bandwidth ($2.42-18.21$ GHz). At the target frequency, the values for gain and VSWR are 6 dB at 13 GHz and 1.8034, respectively. At the intended frequency, the suggested antenna exhibits acceptable impedance match characteristics. Novelty: A round circular shaped antenna was considered in the literature to design ultra-wideband applications. But this leads to spurious radiation because of the continuous patch structure. To guide the currents and reduce the spurious radiation a circular slot is considered in the design which is by itself novel according to the knowledge of the author."

    "abstract": "We investigate a two-layer Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) macrocell where bandwidth is split into inner/outer pools and the outer layer uses reuse-3. A dynamic threshold radius Rth follows the inner/outer user composition to balance load under equal bandwidth sharing and equal-share scheduling, with propagation modeled by 3GPP UMa and noise scaled with bandwidth. The Monte-Carlo simulations also estimate total cell capacity, spectral efficiency, and Jain’s fairness. With the composition changes from 75/25 to 50/50 and further to 25/75 (inner/outer), the distribution of capacities moves to the right and the mean-capacity increases by about 25% and then 34% (cumulative 68%), which is equal to the shift of the median CDF 28-31% per step (cumulative 69%). Spectral efficiency increases by about 23.5% and then 37.5% (cumulative 67.6%), with very small error bars indicating low variability between replications. Meanwhile, Jain’s Fairness Index decreases from 0.73 to 0.69 and 0.41, also confirming the efficiency-fairness trade-off for the baseline policy. These trends align with interferer-thinning in the reuse-3 outer layer and better utilization of effective spectrum as the outer pool serves more users."

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based systems ensures data immutability and traceability, making them well suited for decentralized content governance. However, conventional metadata anchoring strategies remain static and task-agnostic, resulting in suboptimal trade-offs between auditability, privacy, and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a Task-Driven Dynamic Metadata Mapping (TDMM) mechanism that adapts anchoring strategies based on task semantics and user roles. TDMM classifies metadata into three distinct anchoring types: full on-chain anchoring for audit-critical tasks, selective disclosure via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for sensitive attributes, and off-chain reference anchoring for general-purpose metadata. A dedicated mapping controller dynamically routes metadata fields to the appropriate anchoring mode according to predefined task policies. To preserve privacy without sacrificing verifiability, TDMM incorporates a hybrid ZKP architecture that processes proofs off-chain while anchoring verification results on-chain. We implement TDMM on a Hyperledger Fabric network, augmented with IPFS and Circom-based ZKP tooling. Experimental results show that TDMM significantly reduces on-chain storage overhead, lowers re-identification risk, and supports task-appropriate latency and throughput trade-offs, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing transparency, privacy, and scalability in decentralized metadata governance."

    "abstract": "Sunspot detection is critical for mitigating space weather impacts, yet evaluating models across datasets with divergent annotation granularities remains challenging. Traditional IoU-based metrics often misrepresent performance when predicted and ground truth bounding boxes differ in precision (e.g., tight predictions vs. loose annotations). We propose Coverage-based Mean Average Precision (mAP-C), which measures the fraction of a predicted box overlapping any part of a ground truth region, enabling fairer cross-instrument evaluation. Using YOLOv8 trained on two datasets (OGAUC: tight annotations; ROB: loose annotations), we demonstrate that models trained on OGAUC achieve mAP-C@0.6 > 0.81 on ROB—indicating robust detection—while traditional IoU metrics fall to <0.12 due to strict geometric alignment requirements. Training on a fusion of both datasets yields balanced performance (mAP-C@0.6: 0.77 on OGAUC, 0.80 on ROB). These results validate mAP-C as a more reliable metric for multi-instrument sunspot detection, supporting consistent evaluation in operational space weather monitoring."

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. Significance: This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations."

    "abstract": "We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies that focus on low-resolution quantization, this work is more focused on the impact of weak nonlinear distortion due to resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is log (1 + γSNR), where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver front-end, and γ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor (normalized one-sided quantization range) of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the uniform quantizer also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by log (1 + mmse · SNR), where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and it is equal to the minimum of γ. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, showing how small rate losses decay to zero and providing approximations for the achievable rate under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several “per-bit rules” for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks possess remarkable learning capabilities and expressive power, but this makes them vulnerable to overfitting, especially when they encounter mislabeled data. A notable phenomenon called the memorization effect occurs when networks first learn the correctly labeled data and later memorize the mislabeled instances. While early stopping can mitigate overfitting, it doesn't entirely prevent networks from adapting to incorrect labels during the initial training phases, which can result in losing valuable insights from accurate data. Moreover, early stopping cannot rectify the mistakes caused by mislabeled inputs, underscoring the need for improved strategies. In this paper, we introduce an innovative mechanism for continuous review and timely correction of learned knowledge. Our approach allows the network to repeatedly revisit and reinforce correct information while promptly addressing any inaccuracies stemming from mislabeled data. We present a novel method called self-not-true-distillation (SNTD). This technique employs self-distillation, where the network from previous training iterations acts as a teacher, guiding the current network to review and solidify its understanding of accurate labels. Crucially, SNTD masks the true class label in the logits during this process, concentrating on the non-true classes to correct any erroneous knowledge that may have been acquired. We also recognize that different data classes follow distinct learning trajectories. A single teacher network might struggle to effectively guide the learning of all classes at once, which necessitates selecting different teacher networks for each specific class. Additionally, the influence of the teacher network's guidance varies throughout the training process. To address these challenges, we propose SNTD+, which integrates a class-wise distillation strategy along with a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism. Together, these enhancements significantly bolster SNTD's robustness in tackling complex scenarios characterized by label noise."

    "abstract": "The model uncertainty and disturbance lead to an offset between sensed force and desired force by impedance model, which challenges stability and accuracy during compliant control especially when the impedance model is with high stiffness but low damping. In this article, a sliding hypersurface is formed by two cascaded first-order filters biased by force impulse and mismatch between desired impedance and filters’ dynamics. In this way, the force offset can be well estimated even when the impedance model is under-damped. Thereafter, the open-loop dynamics about the force offset is derived, and an adaptive jerk control is formed to attenuate the force offset exponentially. Moreover, passivity analysis demonstrates that this controller permits a wider selection range of impedance parameters, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Specially, its sliding gain is designed as a first-order forced response to the norm of the force offset, so that no positive feedback occurs when the force offset and the composite velocity error have opposite signs. Simulation and real-time experiments on a collaborative robot validate effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a key technology for next-generation wireless networks. ISAC systems face a challenge due to the differing priorities between communication and sensing metrics: communication focuses on maximizing data rates, while sensing prioritizes accurate target detection. To address this, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are introduced to enhance beamforming control, thereby improving both communication and sensing performance. This paper presents an optimization framework for an RIS-assisted ISAC system, aiming to maximize the communication sum rate (SR) while maintaining an acceptable threshold for the sensing metric, specifically the signal-to-clutter-noise ratio (SCNR). The proposed framework utilizes a low-complexity Riemannian manifold optimization technique to jointly design the transmit and receive beamformers at the ISAC base station (BS) and the RIS phase shifts, following an alternating optimization (AO) approach. Specifically, the beamforming and RIS phase shifts are optimized over the complex cone and complex circle manifolds, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this manifold-based approach, the same problem is also solved using AO with classical semidefinite programming (SDP) optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed manifold-based algorithm outperforms existing methods in both communication and sensing metrics, while also reducing computational complexity."

    "abstract": "When lightweight backbones pretrained on natural scene datasets are applied to object detection in aerial remote sensing images (ARSIs), the detection performance varies significantly. This variation stems from factors including the data domain gap, dataset scale, training configuration, and model architecture. Since remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) are pretrained on large-scale remote sensing datasets and exhibit strong feature extraction capabilities, we propose an RSFM-based auxiliary framework to enable existing lightweight backbones to achieve enhanced performance on ARSI datasets of varying scales. Specifically, the RSFM is leveraged to efficiently extract features with robust and rich representational capabilities from input ARSIs. A foundation feature fusion module is designed to fuse the features extracted by the RSFM with those from the lightweight backbone, addressing the inadequacy in representational capacity of various lightweight backbones when extracting ARSI features. Furthermore, a feature aggregation and expansion module is introduced to enhance the representational power of the fused features. Experimental results on four ARSI datasets of different scales demonstrate that the performance of various lightweight backbones is improved when integrated with the proposed RSFM-based auxiliary framework. In most cases, this performance is superior to that of larger-scale networks. Specifically, on the DOTA 1.5 and DIOR datasets, the performance of these lightweight backbones (integrated with the framework) is significantly enhanced compared to that of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Collectively, these results validate the effectiveness of the proposed RSFM-based auxiliary framework, confirming its ability to effectively improve the performance of existing backbones and thereby facilitate the popularization and application of existing technical advancements."

Leveraging a high-fidelity physics-based simulation, our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making structure that decouples high-level target selection from low-level fire control and weapon aiming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based agent significantly outperforms a sophisticated, model-based predictive controller designed to emulate the engagement logic of modern operational defense systems. The developed system exhibits robust performance across diverse engagement scenarios, including multi-drone attacks from various vectors, achieving quantifiable improvements in targeting precision and reaction time against highly agile threats. This research establishes a foundation for developing intelligent, autonomous defense systems capable of neutralizing emergent and evolving UAS threats in modern operational environments."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the AIGC wave reshaping the creative design landscape, color design is rapidly transitioning from intuition-driven to data-intelligence. However, a critical \"semantic gap\" persists between abstract human intentions and controllable parameters of generative tools. To address this challenge, this study proposes and neurocognitively validates a computational framework for semantic color design, grounded in the Chinese linguistic context. The framework integrates two core modules: 1) Semantic Deconstruction, which constructs a multidimensional color-semantic lexicon from Chinese multisource texts using natural language processing and 2) Parametric Mapping, which establishes a controllable model to map structured semantics to quantitative color parameters in the perceptually uniform CIELAB space. Critically, we employed event-related potentials to validate the framework’s semantic accuracy in this cultural context. Neuroscientific evidence has confirmed that colors generated by our framework elicit cognitive responses consistent with target semantics; the N400 effect was statistically equivalent to that of a highly congruent baseline (equivalence test, p < 0.01). The study further revealed a hierarchical contribution of color attributes to semantic conveyance: hue played a decisive role, followed by brightness, whereas the influence of saturation was limited. The proposed framework not only offers a scientific paradigm for bridging the semantic gap in color design but also provides a computational blueprint for next-generation AIGC tools, enabling them to move beyond randomness toward precise, controllable, and semantically meaningful color generation."

Unlike existing studies on event-triggered impulsive control where all node controllers are activated synchronously, each node in the proposed framework independently determines its triggering instants based on its own state. Initially, the interconnection effects are neglected, and node-specific Lyapunov functions are constructed and analyzed. Subsequently, graph-theoretic techniques, combined with the Razumikhin method, are employed to handle the cross-coupling terms and to derive several sufficient conditions. These conditions guarantee the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$</tex-math></inline-formula>th moment exponential stability of the closed-loop system while explicitly accounting for communication delays and attack probabilities. Finally, the theoretical results are applied to inertial neural networks, and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

We propose One-step Network for Open-set JDPE (ONOJ) which using instance-level contrastive learning. In open-set scenarios, jamming of different classes have subtle feature differences due to similar generation principles, while same-class ones can vary significantly due to parameter disparities. To address this problem, we optimize the network backbone and region proposal modules, then introduce a novel aggregation method with unique prototype selection and a dynamic margin contrastive loss designed for jamming characteristics. These enhance open-set performance by balancing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Simulation results indicate that ONOJ demonstrates excellent adaptability and better efficiency in the real-world open wireless communication environment against unknown jamming."

    "abstract": "The rising deadline and heavy pressure on clean energy, as well as the dire situation with wastewater management, are two problems that are exacerbated by the rapid rate of urbanisation and the expansion of smart cities. Traditional wastewater treatment facilities are energy-intensive and have created secondary pollution, while also posing challenges for the sustainability of the requirements of present-day urban systems. At the same time, megacities are increasing their power consumption, which is taxing centralised power grids and also contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. This paper aims to address two issues: one is the introduction of an IoT-based Microbial Bio-Battery (MBB) framework, designed to be both decentralised and sustainable for the generation of renewable electricity and wastewater treatment. The system utilises electroactive bacteria in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) in conjunction with high-end graphene-based electrodes to enhance electron transfer efficiency and improve biofilm stability. An IoT-enabled sensor network, comprising pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensors, can be utilised to monitor real-time values of critical operational parameters. Using secure protocols, data can be sent to a cloud platform such as AWS IoT Core. To achieve maximum power output and treatment performance, a robust control system is employed, utilising an adaptive AI-based optimisation model that incorporates reinforcement learning to control the system's conditions dynamically. The results of the experiments show a significant increase in conventional systems, with power densities exceeding those of the baseline MFCs. This improvement is accompanied by a COD reduction of 92.3% and a biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal of 89.7%. Moreover, the predictive analytics analysis, utilising AI, demonstrated a validity of 98.7% for the payable energy output and treatment level, which further contributes to the robustness of the framework. The offered MBB system addresses urban wastewater management and energy access issues, thereby enabling the development of environmentally friendly, self-reliant Smart city systems. Its dual-purpose concept only underscores how well it can be scaled up to fit into decentralised grids and IoT-driven urban agriculture, establishing a radical change towards resilient and sustainable urban residents. The adaptive control module employs a hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model combining reinforcement learning and neural networks for real-time optimisation of energy output and treatment efficiency."

These include a scarcity of labeled data, rich morphological structure, and the frequent use of idiomatic and culturally nuanced expressions. This paper focuses on the data collection aspect of sarcasm detection in Kannada, outlining the strategies adopted to build a high-quality, manually annotated dataset. We outline the data sources, annotation standards, and protocols to guarantee data balance and quality across sarcastic and non-sarcastic classes. The language and technical difficulties that arose during the collection process are also highlighted in the report. The preliminary analysis of the data being collected has been presented as it lays a strong foundation for effective sarcasm detection in Kannada."

    "abstract": "Urban expansion often leads to the conversion of fertile agricultural land to built-up areas. However, current AI based land use change detection methods encounter difficulties in accurately separating short-term land cover fluctuations (such as seasonal farming cycles or construction phases) from enduring shifts like agricultural-to-urban transitions. These issues can result in incorrect classifications, unreliable assessments of urban growth, and ultimately obstruct effective long-term planning. This study addresses a key limitation in existing AI-driven land use change detection systems: their difficulty in clearly differentiating between temporary and irreversible land transformations. To overcome this, we integrate multi-temporal satellite imagery with detailed ancillary data, including cadastral boundaries, infrastructure overlays, and socio-economic layers. Our proposed ViT-LSTM framework captures both spatial patterns and their evolution over time, offering deeper contextual insights. This level of integration is especially vital for fast-growing urban centers like Bangalore, where informal development often conceals real land conversion dynamics. The method provides policy-makers and urban planners with a valuable tool for actively tracking, managing, and forecasting permanent land transitions with enhanced interpretability and accuracy. The research introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses time-series satellite data with supporting datasets—such as cadastral maps, infrastructure plans, and socio-economic attributes—to improve the reliability of detecting permanent land use changes. Utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) for spatial feature representation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal sequences, the model establishes a strong foundation for analyzing where and how such transitions occur. The system is trained using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, ground-truth cadastral datasets, and official infrastructure records. Experimental findings show a notable increase in classification performance compared to existing models. Ultimately, this approach equips planners and decision-makers with critical insights to drive more informed, sustainable land use policies."

This paper considers a full-duplex wireless system where the base station (BS) aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transmits signal to and receive signal from users simultaneously on the same frequency band. The key idea is to configure the RIS for mitigating the self-interference at the receiver antennas so that the analog-digital converters (ADCs) would not be saturated. By taking into account the quantization noise, we propose to maximize the weighted sum of the uplink and the downlink rates by jointly optimizing the reflection coefficients of the RIS and the precoding vector of the BS. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed RIS-assisted full-duplex wireless system as its uplink-downlink (UL-DL) weighted sum-rate outperforms that of the conventional half-duplex."

Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, provide a promising alternative by enabling cost-effective text data augmentation and report rewriting in varied styles. We rigorously assess augmented data's clinical accuracy and stylistic similarity to radiologist-authored reports through expert evaluations. Interestingly, augmented data enhances RRG model performance, yet performance declines when augmented data surpasses original data volume due to style distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we propose integrating a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) into the RRG model to separate medical semantics from writing styles during training, enabling better handling of augmented data's distribution shift. Our proposed method, X-Gen, combines data augmentation with decoupled training.

We developed a first model capable of increasing the resolution of any satellite image by a factor of 4, and a Sentinel-2-specific model that can increase the resolution by a factor of 8 (from 10 m to 1.25 m). Our method is GAN-based (faster than diffusion models)."

The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a standardized tool used to estimate infarct extent and guide treatment decisions. However, manual ASPECTS scoring on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) faces critical constraints: labor-intensive expert interpretation, substantial inter/intra-rater variability, time-consuming multi-region assessment, and poor sensitivity to early ischemic changes with subtle hypodensity. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework for binary ASPECTS classification (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\leq 6$</tex> vs. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&gt;6$</tex>), the critical threshold for thrombectomy eligibility, to support treatment triage and prognosis without relying on pixel-level annotations.

A 3D convolutional neural network is then trained using volume-level binary ASPECTS labels, enhanced by auxiliary supervision from binary labels for each of the ten ASPECTS regions to encourage region-aware learning. This enables robust infarct pattern recognition while avoiding the need for detailed segmentation masks.

It proposes RoadAware-DIRL, which applies decentralised edge sensing, real-time data merging, and IRL to create a more effective framework for passing information between edge computing devices, thereby improving vehicular navigation. Static maps and re-updated traffic feeds are the mainstays of traditional routing, making it hard for them to deal with quick changes on the roads. With the help of decentralised sensors and an effective noise filter, RoadAware-DIRL fills this gap by keeping a constant track of the road and making sure the data is reliable. This Decision Engine behaves like a human does by using information from stressful navigation events from the past. In addition, a Predictive Obstruction Forecaster depends on recurring road changes to predict where trouble will occur and steer traffic in another direction. Hazardous routes are given higher penalties in a Contextual Cost Map, and MPC keeps making split-second adjustments to the planned path. Extra support for communication is available thanks to V2V and V2I layers, which set up a network of moving road scouts. This framework is better than existing ones since it can adapt flexibly, make decisions locally, and learn like a person. Improved performance, swifter handling of hazards, and less travel disruption support the usage of the system in both autonomous and semi-autonomous cars. The platform makes today’s urban roadways more resilient and aware of the situations they encounter."

    "abstract": "Efficient thermal and power management in modern multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) demands accurate power consumption estimation. One of the state-of-theart approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI), theoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures, addressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI performance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this study, we conducted the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while ABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state temperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying thermal model of ABPI. Our approach utilizes a specialized loss function that constrains the data-driven model according to the system's thermal physics, complemented by NSGA-II multi-objective optimization with efficient convergence strategies to balance estimation accuracy and computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a reduction of 84.7% CPU and 73.9% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE) relative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) improving from 47%-81% to ~ 12%. The method maintains real-time performance with 195.3µs of inference time. Extensive evaluation on unseen benchmarks demonstrates robust generalization without overfitting."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional programming instruction must adapt to the evolving demands of interdisciplinary talent cultivation. This paper proposes an AI-empowered, casedriven teaching model for the “C Programming Language” course, integrating AI-assisted tools, real-world case studies, and ideological and political education to foster both technical competence and social responsibility. Practical implementation demonstrates that the model enhances student engagement, programming and data processing skills, and awareness of ethical and civic values. Comparative analysis further shows that students from different genders, regions, and programming backgrounds benefit in an inclusive manner, helping to narrow learning disparities. Future directions include expanding the case library, extending the model to other programming languages such as Python and Java, and addressing challenges related to data privacy and responsible AI use, thereby offering a sustainable pathway for curriculum reform in computer science education"

It highlights key areas such as demographic change, migration, digitalization, environmental challenges, and cultural identity, all of which significantly influence long-term economic growth. Studies demonstrate that population ageing affects labor markets, migration generates heterogeneous fiscal outcomes, digitalization alters job quality, renewable energy and green finance foster sustainable growth, and cultural identity shapes cooperation and institutional trust.Methodologically, the review covers regression models, fuzzy multicriteria indices, cluster analysis, machine learning, and system dynamics, with special attention to latent variables such as trust, cultural values, and life satisfaction. The analysis shows that most studies remain fragmented, emphasizing the need for integrative approaches that combine economic, demographic, cultural, and ecological dimensions.

Traditional RAN architectures limit adaptability due to proprietary constraints, whereas O-RAN promotes vendor-neutral solutions through modular and open interfaces. This paper presents an ns-3-based simulation model integrating Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize O-RAN operations, focusing on handover decision-making. The study evaluates heuristic-based, distancebased, and ML-driven handover strategies, demonstrating that ML-enhanced approaches reduce packet loss, improve network throughput, and ensure seamless connectivity. Results show that the ML-driven approach dynamically adjusts handover triggers based on real-time network conditions, improving network efficiency. The ML-based handover consistently outperforms Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and distance-based methods, reducing packet loss to 0.5% for UE2 and 0.3% for UE3, compared to 2.7% and 1% with RSRP, and 1.3% and 1.2% with distance-based handovers. Additionally, ML achieves $\\mathbf{1 5 - 2 0 \\%}$ higher throughput with fewer performance dips. While distancebased handovers trigger six transitions, the ML method achieves better performance with only four, demonstrating improved reliability, lower packet loss, and more stable throughput."

    "abstract": "The reception of data frames over long-distance, low-power communication networks is impacted by channel interference, often leading to partial data loss. This issue is particularly significant in systems with low-power transmitters. This paper introduces a method for reconstructing or predicting lost data samples using polynomial regression and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The approach separates the stationary and non-stationary components of the received signals and reconstructs them independently using various combinations of the proposed techniques. The optimal regression fit order for the non-stationary component is determined by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed signal. The proposed method iteratively estimates the distribution parameters of the signal and utilizes matrix completion to recover missing or corrupted data samples. The method is validated using sample data for launch vehicle telemetry system and evaluated under different levels of data loss. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed across various regression configurations, with a comparative assessment of loss percentage versus MSE of the reconstructed signal. Results indicate that fitting the nonstationary signal component with polynomial regression of order higher than five, combined with Expectation-Maximization-based stationary signal reconstruction, yields superior reconstruction accuracy."

    "abstract": "Modern remote monitoring systems critically depend on wireless telemetry links, which suffer severe degradation in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) environments, leading to high Packet Error Rate (PER) and limited operational range. This paper quantitatively analyzes the effectiveness of data compression not just for bandwidth efficiency, but as a proactive channel mitigation strategy. The methodology utilizes a software simulation framework featuring a custom Channel Emulator, which combines a Log-distance propagation model to calculate large-scale path loss and a Gilbert-Elliot stochastic model to replicate the bursty error characteristics of small-scale fading. The results demonstrate that compression significantly enhances link performance, especially in challenging conditions. Specifically, in the simulated NLOS-Urban scenario, compression reduced the relative PER by 21.8%, which directly translated into a 14.3% extension of the reliable operational range. Furthermore, the corresponding reduction in ARQ retransmissions improved effective goodput by 11.8% and reduced average end-to-end latency by a substantial 41.1%. The findings prove that data compression is an essential strategy for building more robust, reliable, and responsive telemetry systems for demanding NLOS applications."

This study derive a unified optimization framework based on the majorization-minimization of the multichannel Itakura-Saito divergence, enabling joint learning of spectral and spatial parameters in an end-toend manner. The proposed approach effectively combines the strengths of deep learning and traditional probabilistic modeling: the Conformer encoder captures long-range contextual dependencies and complex acoustic patterns, while the NMF structure ensures interpretability and stability in spectro-temporal decomposition. Experimental results on the CHiME dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across multiple objective metrics, including SDR, PESQ, and STOI, validating its effectiveness in real-world multi-channel speech enhancement tasks."

    "abstract": "Amid increasingly stringent data privacy regulations and growing demands for cross-institutional data collaboration, vertical federated learning (VFL) has garnered considerable research interest as a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm. In VFL, where data is distributedly stored under strict privacy guarantees, traditional feature selection methods are not directly applicable. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an interactive feature selection approach based on differential privacy (DP-IFS). By introducing carefully calibrated noise during the processing of distributed matrices and mutual information calculations, the method enables the assessment of feature interactions and facilitates efficient feature selection without exposing sensitive data. Experimental results demonstrate that this method not only ensures robust privacy protection, but also achieves feature selection accuracy (79%~90%) comparable to state-of-the-art ciphertext-based approaches. Furthermore, it reduces the number of selected features by 25% to 55% compared to other advanced methods. This reduction not only enhances computational efficiency but also significantly lowers storage overhead, thereby improving the method's practical applicability."

    "abstract": "Effective metadata management is fundamental to data governance, ensuring that data assets are discoverable, understandable, and usable across the enterprise. However, traditional metadata systems often remain purely technical, describing structures without conveying business meaning. This disconnect — known as the semantic gap — limits the interpretability and value of metadata for business users. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Cognitive Data Catalog (CDC) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-readable, business-oriented descriptions for tables and attributes using their names, data types, and sample values. A quantitative measure, the Semantic Gap Index (SGI), is introduced to assess the improvement in semantic richness achieved through LLM-based enrichment.Experimental evaluation with several LLMs demonstrates that the proposed approach substantially enhances metadata completeness and interpretability, reduces manual documentation effort, and accelerates data discovery. The results confirm the potential of LLMs to advance metadata management by transforming conventional catalogs into intelligent, semantically aware knowledge systems."

However, in high-dimensional scenarios, conventional zero-order models often suffer from numerical underflow due to the multiplicative aggregation of membership values. Existing models typically alleviate numerical underflow by increasing the width of the Gaussian membership function (GMF), which inevitably reduces semantic clarity. To achieve a similar effect while preserving interpretability, we introduce the concept of fractional calculus into the Gaussian kernel function and thus design the fractional-order GMF (FGMF). Based on FGMF, we develop an FGMF-based FNN (FGMF-FNN) to effectively handle high-dimensional challenges. Experimental results on high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that FGMF-FNN can significantly mitigate numerical underflow while achieving higher generalization performance than competing models."

Using a standardized 10,000-pair corpus, we show that transfer learning markedly improves translation quality in both directions over models trained from scratch. We further analyze whether the linguistic characteristics of the parent language—particularly morphological similarity—affect transfer effectiveness. Results indicate that both parent models achieve similar gains, suggesting that vocabulary coverage and tokenization dominate over morphological resemblance. These findings demonstrate the utility of transfer learning for endangered languages and underscore the need for linguistically informed methods and community involvement in revitalization efforts."

When attacking a system, attackers must keep their remote shell active to perform post-attacks. That is, to maintain the stability of the connection. The injection and migration processes are suitable techniques for achieving this goal. However, it is not always easy to peacefully land on a device without prior infecting and/or bypassing the security measures set on the target device. Various techniques can be used to obtain that foothold access, for example, remote code execution, command injection, phishing, etc. Phishing is often a complex scenario; nonetheless, it can be highly significant for attackers. Due to the trust Microsoft Office has earned from companies, adversaries can exploit it through phishing to prepare a shellcode (payload) in Word memory, which is sufficient for the landing phase. In this paper, we will analyze the working techniques that usually help attackers obtain a callback upon arrival at the victim’s target."

Special attention is paid to the analysis of tail risks (upper 5% of the distribution), characterized by duration exceeding 120 minutes and losses 2-2.5 times higher than median values. A detailed 15-step algorithm for transforming the model into an operational decision support system is proposed."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of digitalization and artificial intelligence workloads has positioned data centers among the fastest-growing electricity consumers worldwide. Traditionally viewed as passive loads, modern data centers possess advanced energy infrastructures, such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, battery storage, and intelligent cooling, that can be leveraged as flexible resources for smart grid operation. This paper proposes an integration framework between Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) and Smart Grid Energy Management Systems (SG-EMS) to enable bidirectional energy and information exchange. The proposed architecture coordinates local assets within data centers with grid-level control for demand response, peak shaving, and renewable energy utilization. A case study of a 10 MW data center equipped with a 1 MWh battery and 2 MW photovoltaic plant demonstrates that coordinated control can reduce peak grid demand by up to 18%, lower daily energy costs by approximately 17%, and provide sub-second frequency response without affecting IT service performance. The results confirm the potential of data centers to act as virtual energy storage units and active participants in smart grids. Future developments include AI-driven predictive control, digital twins for co-simulation, and secure interoperability between DCIM and SG-EMS platforms."

These intrusions not only put data security at risk but also threaten the availability and integrity of important information, posing significant dangers to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. This study proposes Machine Learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection using the widely recognized CIC-IDS2017 dataset, which is a benchmark in cybersecurity research. The research evaluates each approach based on the performance of classifiers after preprocessing the data to remove irrelevant features that have minimal impact on attack detection. The results show that the Random Forest classifier, combined with the Correlation feature selection method, performs exceptionally well, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of $99.61 \\%$. These results show the degree of efficiency of a robust data preprocessing strategy in enhancing intrusion detection systems’ capabilities in classifying attack traffic, namely DDoS, Brute Force attacks, scans, Webbased attacks, Bots, Denial of Service, and Heartbleed vulnerabilities. The comparison between total accuracy provided by these techniques makes such research valuable in terms of insights for optimizing cybersecurity defenses against dynamically correlated threats thriving in this digital age."

While system size, typically measured by atom count, is often used to estimate simulation performance, the impact of biophysical system composition remains underexplored. This study investigated GPU-accelerated simulation throughput using GROMACS on an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU across eight atom count-controlled systems (approximately 82,000 atoms) with varying biophysical compositions. The benchmark set included water-only, protein-ligand, membrane-only, and membrane-protein systems, matched to the standard benchMEM system for controlled comparison. MD systems with high water and protein content consistently demonstrated superior GPU performance exceeding 30% compared to lipid-rich systems, despite equivalent atom counts. Membrane-protein systems exhibited modest improvements over membrane-only systems, likely due to more favorable domain decomposition properties. These findings provide quantitative insight into the influence of system composition on GPU performance and offer practical information for optimizing MD simulation systems in terms of biological complexity and computational efficiency."

In this paper, we propose an enhanced Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, called TTT-MoE, and integrate it within the advanced nnU-Net framework. Our TTT-MoE layer harnesses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to enhance the internal self-supervised learning modules originally developed for the TTT layer. This methodology enables more effective extraction of clinically relevant features, improving segmentation performance across diverse anatomical structures and imaging modalities.

    "abstract": "This work looks to review the state-space representation for the case of systems with causality at the limit. Circuits with non-independent capacitors or inductors, as effect of the loops with voltage sources and, respectively, nodes with current sources, are modeled as causal systems at the limit. The effect on state-space equation is the appearance of the derivative of the inputs. This is a non-standard structure of state-space representation and sometimes creates difficulties in solving and integrating in the standard/classical form of various software tools. Two basic solutions are presented and discussed. The first one is part of the general method of similarity, which works with state-space equations. The second one decomposes the transfer function into two components, of which one is strictly causal and can generate the standard form of the state-space equations. The solutions investigated are equivalent from the point of view of the results. Two test cases are considered. A separate objective is related to the explanation of the methodology in developing a state-space representation starting from the topology of the circuit. The aspects considered are useful for engineers who work in the field of modelling and simulation and need accurate models from the system engineering domain."

Exponential models capture polarization and diffusion dynamics, and the predicted voltage closely matches experimental measurements during relaxation. The approach enables precise SOC estimation and can be directly integrated into battery management systems for real-time monitoring and energy management. Experimental results validate the method, confirming its effectiveness for predictive model and practical implementation in modern Li-Ion battery systems."

    "abstract": "The gate driver is crucial for silicon carbide (SiC) based power electronics, by directly governing switching speed, efficiency, and EMI performance, while it also ensures reliability through protection against false turn-on, overvoltage, and short-circuit events. This paper presents a simplified gate driver layout for SiC-based medium-voltage power modules. The design employs dual gate driver ICs per switching position to supply the required gate current, thereby enhancing the switching performance of the power module. The proposed gate driver adopts a two-level hierarchical PCB design: one level integrates the driver components closely with the SiC dies for reduced gate loop inductances and fast switching speed, while the other provides high isolation to support medium-voltage operation. The connections from the gate driver to the power module are provided through co-axial pins for improved noise immunity. The proposed gate driver architecture was evaluated using a discrete half-bridge switch setup, demonstrating high switching performance with measured slew rates of 104.23 V/ns for turn-on and 152.38 V/ns for turn-off."

Traditional fault handling practices are usually performed through manual time-delayed reporting that is isolated from inventory and maintenance systems. To overcome these limitations, an all-encompassing AI-powered fault reporting and resolution system is designed for academic settings. Developed on a contemporary full-stack web framework, the system follows a role-based approach in which students can report failures, technicians can monitor repair progress, and administrators can monitor overall maintenance activity. The main innovations include an AI-supported fault category prediction module utilizing the Random Forest algorithm, workload analysis employing a Workload Balancer algorithm, and a smart NLP-powered chatbot that helps users follow simple troubleshooting steps. The chatbot is driven by a locally trained model with the capability to understand natural language queries about technical equipment faults. In addition, an integrated analytics dashboard provides real-time insights into fault patterns, equipment status, and technician workloads, thus supporting data-driven decision-making. The smart and combined solution improves the time to fix faults, optimizes resource allocation, and increases the overall efficiency of laboratory maintenance processes."

    "abstract": "Ensuring objectivity in expert-based educational program evaluations remains challenging due to inherent subjectivity and uncertainty of the assessment processes. In this study, we apply fuzzy signature models to address these issues within the evaluation framework of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee (MAB). A generalized fuzzy signature structure was developed, that supports discrete answer categories and hierarchical question groups. We systematically investigated how key parameters-fuzzy number shape, aggregation operators, and defuzzification methods-affect final evaluation outcomes. Two types of fuzzy coverage sets (core-based and support-based) were tested across multiple configurations using simulated data $(k=100,000)$ aligned with typical expert response distributions. Statistical analysis, including paired t-tests and normality tests, revealed that the Largest of Maximum (LoM) defuzzification method combined with arithmetic mean aggregation and a core-to-support ratio of 0.75 yielded the highest classification accuracy ($83.77 \\%$) and the most stable results. Core-based (Type 1) coverage consistently outperformed support-based (Type 2) coverage in 98% of tested configurations. These findings provide practical guidance for the design of robust and interpretable fuzzy evaluation systems and support the development of more transparent quality assurance tools in higher education. This work goes beyond mere comparison by systematically analyzing the sensitivity of fuzzy evaluation systems to parameter choices, which is critical for robust system design of accreditation models."

While Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data provides rich spectral information, its moderate resolution poses challenges for identifying small-scale features due to limited spatial detail and mixed pixel effects. This study explores the use of super-resolution techniques to enhance S2 imagery, improving its capacity for tiny object detection. An annotated dataset was developed to identify aircraft and vessels across various areas of interest, enabling a comprehensive and detailed evaluation. The detection process leveraged a hybrid approach that integrates a YOLO object detector with a vision-transformer-based object density estimator. By combining these methods, false positives were significantly reduced, leading to notable improvements in precision and F1 score. These results highlight that super-resolved S2 imagery can serve as an effective and economical alternative for detecting tiny objects, particularly in scenarios where very high-resolution imagery is unavailable or cost-prohibitive."

LiDAR-based solutions offer high accuracy in localizing surrounding objects; however, distinguishing homogeneous robots with similar appearances remains challenging due to the lack of distinctive identification features. In this article, we propose a fully distributed relative pose estimation approach by integrating LiDAR, ultra-wideband (UWB), and odometry measurements, allowing each robot to accurately and continuously localize its teammates without external infrastructure. Specifically, potential anonymous teammate robot clusters from LiDAR scans are tracked by a dynamic tracker. We then identify teammate robots from these tracked anonymous clusters using a joint matching strategy, ensuring reliable data association between robots and clusters. Finally, by combining the corresponding LiDAR observations, UWB ranging, and odometry measurements, each robot precisely localizes others while minimizing data exchange. The system requires only odometry data exchange through onboard UWB, eliminating the need for additional communication infrastructure like WiFi routers or mesh networks. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed relative localization approach."

    "abstract": "With the increasing frequency of port trade activities, oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems. The complex port environments, characterized by diverse land cover types and intricate land-water interfaces, present significant challenges for oil spill detection (OSD). To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach based on the segment anything model (SAM) for port OSD tasks utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing imagery. The proposed DADS-SAM freezes most parameters of SAM and performs PEFT only on adapters. Dynamic adaptive low-rank adaptation (DALoRA) enhances the model’s adaptability to port OSD tasks by incorporating dynamic adaptive low-rank matrices into the self-attention modules of the SAM encoder, while dual scale convolutional adapter (DSCA) improves the model’s capability to capture local features and spatial dependencies in oil spill regions. Since the original SAM model lacks class-specific segmentation capabilities, we further design a multi-class segmentation head (MCSH) for oil spill segmentation. This head obtains the output masks from the SAM decoder, adjusts their dimensions, and transforms them through two linear layers to generate class-specific segmentation results. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a PEFT approach to port OSD tasks. The proposed method was evaluated on both publicly available port oil-spill datasets and marine oil-spill datasets acquired via synthetic-aperture radar (SAR). Quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DADS-SAM outperforms conventional approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated metrics. Models and data are publicly available at https://github.com/PetrichorAsh/DADS-SAM."

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy in power systems, wideband oscillation issues have become increasingly prominent, necessitating the accurate acquisition of grid wideband impedance characteristics to support stability analysis. Existing measurement methods face significant limitations, stemming mainly from the inability to control the spectrum of the injected wideband disturbance. This lack of spectral controllability leads to two major drawbacks: insufficient energy concentration in the target frequency band, compromising measurement accuracy, and the introduction of substantial non-target frequency components into the grid, resulting in additional harmonic pollution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a spectrum-controllable wideband disturbance injection method based on AC-AC modulation. To begin with, an improved chopper-controlled AC voltage regulation circuit featuring relatively simple topology is designed, injecting wideband disturbance into the power grid based on AC-AC modulation. Furthermore, in order to eliminate harmonic cancellation effects caused by multi-frequency disturbance injection, a novel Non-overlapping Band Optimized Injection (NBOI) method is proposed. Lastly, the Schroeder’s phase optimization algorithm is employed to reduce the crest factor of modulation signals, resulting in higher disturbance energy in measurement frequency band, within the range of modulation signal’s amplitude. The proposed method enables direct control of the harmonic spectrum, allowing precise acquisition of wideband impedance characteristics in a single test, offering an effective approach for the stability analysis of grid-connected converters. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves over 99% energy concentration in the target measurement band. The proposed method achieves a Harmonic Distribution Uniformity (HDU) metric approaching 0, indicating near-perfect spectral distribution uniformity across the target frequency range. The impedance measurement accuracy shows less than 2% deviation from theoretical values, validating the method’s effectiveness for rapid, accurate wideband impedance characterization with minimal grid impact."

    "abstract": "Railway infrastructure security is contingent upon the prompt identification of structural anomalies within steel tracks. This research establishes a framework that merges acoustic emission (AE) sensing with advanced machine learning for prompt fracture identification and location. To improve the quality of Raw AE signals, they are first cleaned using Kalman filtering to tackle environmental disturbances and ambiguous readings. The characteristics that arise from entropy comprising approximate entropy, Shannon entropy, and dimensional entropy are derived to delineate the temporal patterns of fracture-induced emissions. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is applied to remove outliers during preprocessing. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks classify crack locations into three anatomical regions: rail head, web, and foot. Experimental validation with 3,000 labeled AE signals (1,000 per class) under laboratory conditions, the full pipeline that integrates Kalman filtering, entropy features, DBSCAN, and an LSTM classifier attains an accuracy of 98.83%. With an entropy-based variant, the accuracy drops to 96.67%, confirming the incremental value of temporal denoising and outlier rejection. While using mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) baseline achieves 97.67% accuracy, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on Kalman-filtered, entropy-based, and DBSCAN-processed inputs reaches 96.33% accuracy, underscoring the advantages of temporal modeling for AE. A GRU using the same Kalman-filtered, entropy-based, and DBSCAN-processed inputs, achieves 97.67% accuracy, but trails the LSTM overall. When deployed on actual railway lines with a mobile inspection platform, the system maintained robust performance, correctly identifying 84.67% of cracks at 3 km/h and 80.67% at 5 km/h. The LSTM configuration consistently outperformed all alternative approaches, including the entropy-only variant, MFCC-based method, DNN classifier, and GRU model. This confirms the LSTM’s enhanced capability to capture the temporal dynamics of AE signals, establishing it as the most effective framework for AE-based crack localization in railway structural health monitoring."

    "abstract": "Adopting Model-Based Development (MBD) in automotive software becomes necessary because it provides a rigorous development process. As the increase in the number of software components (SWCs) and their interactions, modifications to one part of the software might impact other parts due to the high coupling of SWCs. Developing an automated software refactoring technique to implement high cohesion and low coupling of software is necessary. Software refactoring usually contains code refactoring and architecture refactoring. Code refactoring only modifies the code inside the SWCs without changing its original functionality and external behavior, whereas current architecture refactoring does not consider the interaction weight (strength) between SWCs. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this study, we propose a weighted community division algorithm called Weighted-Girvan-Newman (W-GN) for software architecture refactoring. W-GN algorithm refactors the architecture by dividing SWCs into modules based on the interaction weights of SWCs. We further develop an automated architecture refactoring tool called AutoToolMD. This tool assists engineers in improving development efficiency and ensures the architecture aligns with the requirements of high cohesion and low coupling. Evaluations show that W-GN indicates more suitable modularity values than the traditional Girvan-Newman (GN) algorithm because the former can better reflect the real architecture with interaction weights. We apply AutoToolMD to automatically refactor architecture in automotive industry practice. Case study with the Zone_B PwrSplyMngt and Zone L_Lock modules in the Honda zone control software shows that AutoToolMD effectively refactors architecture with a significant improvement in testing efficiency and readability.</p>"

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. Significance: This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations."

    "abstract": "Multi-terminal high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmission system is a promising approach to connect offshore wind power plants (WPPs) to onshore ac grids. However, there is no standardized protection method against DC faults. As one of its protection methods, mechanical dc circuit breakers (DCCBs) have the potential to improve supply reliability against dc faults while avoiding a cost increase. Nevertheless, due to their relatively slower operation, the blocking of half-bridge based modular multilevel converter (HBMMC) is often required. In offshore ac collecting system, where the HBMMC maintains the grid voltage, such converter blocking can destabilize the grid voltage and lead to shutdowns of offshore WPPs. Large scale shutdowns of offshore WPPs may have a negative impact on onshore ac grids. Therefore, this article proposes a protection method that enables the continuous operation of offshore WPPs while using mechanical DCCBs. The proposed method focuses on the backbone HVDC configuration connecting multiple onshore and offshore terminals, and applies different fault clearing methods across the terminals. At onshore terminals which form a loop configuration, mechanical DCCBs selectively isolate the faulted section. At offshore terminals which form a radial configuration, reconfiguration is employed to reroute power transmission from the faulted line to the healthy line. These operations are coordinated based on the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of offshore WPPs and realizes their continuous operation. The proposed method is verified by an experiment using the scaled-down three-terminal HVDC system."

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a crucial role in the remote sensing community but faces difficulties due to the heterogeneity between the image and text modalities. While existing methods primarily focus on enhancing cross-modal alignment, they suffer from two key issues. One is that fine-grained local alignment approaches extract local features lacking contextual integration, which leads to semantic inconsistency. The other is that conventional losses fail to adapt to the varying model states of different subtasks, which may lead to the model calibration problems. This implies a mismatch between the confidence scores of the network and the true probabilities. To address these challenges, this study proposes two complementary components. One is a Local Semantic Consistency Interaction (LSCI) module, which uses cross-attention and self-attention along with an image-text alignment head to optimize multimodal representations and mitigate context-induced semantic inconsistency. The other is Task-specific Calibration loss (TC), which dynamically adjusts the gamma parameter in Focal or inv-Focal loss, allowing the model to prioritize both hard and easy sample pairs according to the calibration error specific to each subtask. The gamma parameter is adjusted by leveraging the previous states of the model and the knowledge of calibration performance on the validation set. By integrating the LSCI module and TC loss, the semantic inconsistency between image and text can be improved, and model calibration can be enhanced. Comparative assessments conducted on three public datasets show that our methods can achieve competitive performance on the RSITR task compared to many existing methods.

This paper presented a video steganography system based on a discrete cosine transform (DCT) that embeds text messages into the luminance component of the video frames, and ensures that the data is robust against noise and compression by employing a repetition-based error correction coding (ECC) scheme, where the message is embedded by modifying DC coefficients of deterministically chosen 8x8 pixel blocks with fixed-strength (150.0). The steganography system was evaluated using a wide range of metrics including peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean squared error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).In addition, the difference between the DC coefficient distributions in the embedding of the original frames and the steganographic one is represented as histograms to help chronicle the way the steganographic process may have impacted the frequency domain. The results of high PSNR and SNR with low levels of MSE, RMSE, MAE, and BER suggest a successful data hiding procedure by examining the visual changes to the steganographic frames. Comprehensive information is provided by the logging and diagnostic outputs the steganographic and video embedding algorithms produced, including saved DC coefficient distributions in the traditional frequency domain. All of these elements helped to show that DCT-based video steganography is a viable way to communicate in a secure manner and that there are possibilites to improve efficiency in hiding data, while minimizing impact to the visual quality of the video frame."

The method facilitates the automation of repetitive procedures involved in sharing information between software for developing transport planning designs and traffic simulation software.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy has led to the worldwide adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Accurate predictions of solar irradiance are necessary for the integration of PV systems into the electrical grid. Through utilizing of advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, this study aims to improve solar irradiance prediction. XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), LightGBM, CatBoost, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) are among the state-of-the-art models whose performance is assessed by a thorough framework. The HI-SEAS weather station provides a strong dataset of 32,686 entries with 11 meteorological parameters, including temperature, pressure, humidity, wind direction, and wind speed, which is used to train and test these models. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure highquality input for the models, and feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance predictive accuracy. Standard metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and statistical <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$</tex>, are used to thoroughly assess each model's performance. Our results show that Gradient Boosting and LightGBM are two of the ML models that perform well, demonstrating their capacity to process high-dimensional data and produce precise predictions. LSTM, and BiLSTM models perform better than conventional ML techniques when it comes to identifying the intricate, non-linear correlations present in solar irradiance data. By identifying the most effective models, this research advances reliable solar forecasting tools for enabling continuous grid integration and supporting the global transition to sustainable energy."

    "abstract": "Countries are launching Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity label programs to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and motivate manufacturers to create more secure IoT products. In such programs, products that meet program requirements can be sold with a special label to signal cybersecurity compliance. Currently, there is no evidence-based guidance or standardized implementation of labels or label-awarding program policies. We conducted an online survey to understand the impact of IoT labels and choices such as validation requirements (i.e., whether manufacturers need to self attest or seek third-party audits to validate their products’ compliance) regarding participants’ security and privacy concerns. Our research provides empirical evidence to guide policy choices by effective label-awarding programs. We find that the presence of IoT labels alleviated both security and privacy concerns; however, we did not find differences between other program implementation choices. We provide recommendations for IoT cybersecurity label programs and discuss the potential societal impacts of label programs."

Based on the results, an averaged model was developed that predicts the current waveform of the LED lighting load for a given active power. This model can be used for accurate modeling of distorting loads to assess the level of voltage non-sinusoidality at network nodes."

The single antenna element of the proposed MIMO antenna module consists of a T-shape feed printed on one side of the RT duroid low-loss substrate and two rectangular slots loaded ground plane on the other side. The MIMO antenna designs have been realized using the anti-parallel arrangement of two antenna units relative to one another. The proposed MIMO has a small design of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12.5 \\times 6.25 \\times 0.8 \\text{mm}^{3}$</tex>. The antiparallel arrangement is generating pattern diversity. The achieved impedance bandwidth ranges from 25.8 GHz to 32.8 GHz, including a total span of 7 GHz, which includes the critical band N257 (26.5-29.5 GHz) for 5G millimeter-wave communications. Wideband impedance matching is achieved by optimized feed geometry, guaranteeing steady performance over the designated mm-wave frequency range. High port isolation is achieved without intricate decoupling mechanisms, hence minimizing design complexity and preserving a small footprint. The simulation was conducted using the Ansys HFSS electromagnetic solver. The suggested MIMO antenna demonstrates a minimal envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and substantial diversity gain (DG), and consistent gain patterns, making it an appropriate choice for next-generation high-speed wireless communication systems."

The atomicity principle and different atomic block patterns have been proposed in the past as effective means to counter simple SideChannel Analysis (SCA) attacks. In this work, using our software and hardware implementations as an example, we show that the binary left-to-right kP algorithm with Chevallier-Mames atomic block patterns for point doubling and point addition is vulnerable to simple data-bit SCA attacks. Atomic blocks involving multiplications with special values like 1 are visibly distinguishable. For the right-to-left kP algorithm, this distinguishability is observable only in atomic patterns executed immediately after initialisation. We also show that the well-known randomisation of EC point coordinates, originally designed as a countermeasure against vertical attacks, is also effective against such horizontal data-bit SCA attacks."

    "abstract": "Geothermal fields in Indonesia are generally located in areas of volcanic deposits characterized by mountainous to hilly areas dominated by steep slopes, which can trigger natural ground movements or landslides. Therefore, landslides are one of the geological hazards (Geohazard) in geothermal areas that can impact facilities and local communities. When ground cracks begin to appear, monitoring of ground movement must be carried out immediately to determine the next hazard mitigation steps that need to be taken. Manual measurements carried out directly will pose a danger to workers. With Internet of Things technology, measurements can be done online without the need to come directly to the location where the ground crack occurred. The method and implementation involve using a distance sensor connected to a controller. Data is transmitted via a long-range Wi-Fi network. The received data is integrated with a data logger in real time. In addition to ground movement data, rainfall is also measured as supporting data that may influence ground conditions. Online monitoring is expected to provide real-time data for further analysis and to serve as an early warning system in the event of significant ground movement. Another key objective is to reduce the risk to workers due to the potential danger of landslides when conducting manual measurements."

Among these, gaze tracking stands as a beacon, promising to unlock hands-free control and enhanced user experiences. However, hardware-based eye trackers often compete with the inflated cost and impractical setups of standard hardware-based eye trackers. The present work focuses on the development of an open source gaze estimation system, creating a user-calibrated, real-time focus prediction system based on a commonly available web camera and the robust technology of Google’s MediaPipe Face Mesh pipeline. The proposed solution is based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) models with custom feature engineering that incorporates both facial landmarks and head pose dynamics. The paper details a calibration methodology designed to forge a bespoke mapping for each user, adapting to individual biometric and environmental variations. Furthermore, this work addresses practical implementation considerations, including the crucial step of feature scaling and the process of hyperparameter optimization via exhaustive grid search. The presented results, as illustrated in the accompanying scatter plots, demonstrate the SVR models’ ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships, marking a promising step towards robust and accessible gaze tracking in diverse interactive paradigms."

Industrial facilities operating at medium voltage are often affected by power quality issues such as low power factor, excessive reactive power demand, voltage drops, and high distribution losses. These factors not only reduce the operational efficiency of the electrical network but also increase energy costs and the risk of equipment malfunction. Capacitor banks represent a well-established and cost-effective solution to address such problems by compensating reactive power, stabilizing voltage profiles, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the system.In this study, a 6 kV distribution network supplying an industrial process was analyzed under two conditions: before and after the implementation of capacitor banks. Key performance indicators such as active and reactive power flow, power factor, system losses, and voltage stability were carefully monitored. The analysis revealed that the integration of properly sized capacitor banks significantly improved the power factor, reduced energy losses, and maintained voltage within the recommended limits. These improvements not only enhance the reliability and efficiency of the industrial process but also contribute to lowering operational costs and ensuring compliance with power quality standards. The findings confirm that capacitor banks are an effective and sustainable approach for improving power quality in medium-voltage industrial networks."

This research presents an enhanced multi-class vehicle detection framework utilizing Swin Transformers, known for their hierarchical attention mechanisms and robust feature extraction. The proposed system achieves low-latency processing comparable to established models such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and Faster R-CNN. Specifically, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 typically yield 55–60% mean average precision (mAP) on custom datasets, while Faster R-CNN achieves 60–65% mAP. The integration of Swin Transformer with YOLOv5 (custom head) attains 75% mAP, and Swin Transformer combined with Mask R-CNN achieves 70–80% mAP. The standalone Swin Transformer also maintains high detection accuracy. These results indicate the system’s suitability for deployment in smart city infrastructures."

To overcome these limitations, this work proposes the integration of blockchain technology for decentralized and tamper-resistant policy management. A functional prototype combining OpenDaylight, Ethereum smart contracts, and a Node.js middleware was implemented and tested in a Mininet environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that, compared with a traditional centralized SDN controller, the proposed system increases policy registration latency from 45 ms to 210 ms on average and CPU load from 18% to 27%. However, it ensures full traceability, immutability, and resilience of network policies. Moreover, in failure scenarios, policies remain verifiable and enforceable, whereas centralized solutions lose control. These findings confirm that the blockchain-based approach provides improved security and governance at the cost of moderate overhead, making it suitable for critical infrastructures such as 5G and multi-domain networks."

Gathering continuous data from these sensors allows us to generate a complete spatiotemporal field for the desired measurements. However, obtaining continuous sensing data at all locations and times is often infeasible due to resource limits, cost constraints, and practicality. To address this problem, we proposed a Learned Gumbel-Based Active Sparse MCS framework utilizing an Encoder-Decoder Time Series Transformer that reconstructs the full spatiotemporal field for a given time cycle and a small subset of available sensors. Notably, an active sensor selection layer is included, which leverages the Gumbel distribution to create noise from learned weights, helping to dynamically select the most effective sensors for the next sensing cycle. We verified the effectiveness of our proposed model by comparing it to random selection, attention-scoring, and statistical methods. Our Gumbel-Based selector achieves higher performance in both firstand second-order norm metrics."

    "abstract": "An effective method of automated selection of the number of stages of one of the most important and widespread blocks used in digital integrated circuits, the ring oscillator, based on machine learning (ML), is presented. In addition to the ability to automatically determine the number of stages, it also provides the best tradeoff between the main parameters: power, area and performance due to the ability to take the peculiarities caused by the technological process into account. The use of the ML method made it possible to reduce the duration of the RO stage calculation by approximately 4-5 times, at the expense of a 3,57% loss of accuracy."

The paper shows that the application of a modification of the Khurgin-Yakovlev algorithm in adaptive noise-resistant underwater communication systems makes it possible to improve the quality of reconstructed speech at the output of the transmission system under the influence of interference in the communication channel. The use of systems based on the modification of the Khurgin-Yakovlev algorithm makes it possible to increase the transmission range of information under the influence of interference in the underwater communication channel. Computer modeling has shown that the distance gain when using a modification of this algorithm is from 75 km, with a frequency band from 1 to 6.3 kHz and an acoustic carrier from 3.3 to 21 kHz with the given initial data."

This paper comprehensively evaluates LLM-generated code utilizing the Codeforces Benchmark, and proposes XML-Structured Prompts (XSP) to improve code quality. Specifically, we present three creative strategies: XSP for improving problem comprehension, Syntax-Aware XSP (SA-XSP) for mitigating syntax errors, and Testcase-Driven Logic Error Debugging (TDLED) for resolving logic errors through test case feedback. Our experiments on 30 LLMs, ranging from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.5 ~\\mathrm{B}, 70 ~\\mathrm{B}$</tex>, to 671 B parameters and including 5 reasoning models, demonstrate that the proposed methods improve accuracy by up to 27.5 %, especially in smaller models, with syntax error reductions of up to 60 % and logic error corrections by up to 30%."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of cloud services highlights the need for intelligent and adaptive systems to monitor virtual machine (VM) performance. While most studies focus on public cloud deployments, this work investigates machine learningbased performance prediction in resource-constrained cloud environments. A three-layer monitoring pipeline is proposed: (1) time-series prediction using GRU, TCN, and XGBoost models; (2) anomaly detection through residuals, z-scores, and health scores; and (3) performance classification using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Preprocessing includes RAM-to-percentage conversion, MinMaxScaler normalization for CPU, sliding window creation, and data partitioning. Model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and residual analysis. A confidence index is introduced to combine prediction accuracy and decision stability over time. Experimental results show that the TCN model achieves the highest confidence index, indicating a strong balance between sensitivity and consistency. GRU and XGBoost are more stable but slower in reacting to anomalies, while the LSTM baseline tends to classify many conditions as uncertain. The entire pipeline is deployed through a Streamlit-based dashboard that visualizes inference results and VM classifications in real time. System usability is tested using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and yields a score of 85, placing the system in the “Excellent” category and indicating high user satisfaction. This study presents a modular and lightweight monitoring framework suitable for adaptive performance management in clouds."

Existing disaster management strategies often lack regional interoperability, standardized data protocols, and sustainable financial models for advanced Early Warning Systems (EWS). This paper proposes the ASEAN Integrated Network for Early Warning and Tracking (AINET)—an innovative framework combining Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time seismic data collection, Artificial Intelligence (AI) for rapid event analysis, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for dynamic impact visualization and information dissemination. The system is designed with aggressive performance targets, specifically aiming for sub-second data acquisition and processing, enabling multi-second alert delivery to minimize the critical time gap before destructive S-waves arrive. Critically, the study introduces a Digital Business Value Framework that outlines how the technical design generates measurable socio-economic value and financial sustainability, distinguishing it from conventional, purely government-funded EEWS models. This framework leverages principles of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Return on Investment (ROI) by quantifying the value generated from averted losses in infrastructure and human capital across the disaster management cycle. AINET presents a crucial strategic roadmap toward a more resilient, technologically advanced, and economically self-sustaining disaster management ecosystem for the ASEAN region."

The sample of universities that implement training in the field of AI covers all federal districts of the Russian Federation, demonstrating a balanced representation - from the Central (11 universities) to the Far Eastern (4 universities) districts, which ensures the representativeness of the results for the entire system of Russian higher education. The methodology includes systematization and classification of more than 3 thousand disciplines in five key modules: \"Computer Science\", \"Mathematics\", \"Software Engineering\", \"Practices and Certification\" and \"Other Disciplines\". To identify structural patterns, the hierarchical clustering method (Ward’s method) is used, where the input data is the percentage distribution of the academic load between the selected modules. Tile maps, dendrograms and radar diagrams are used to visualize the results of the analysis. Cluster analysis made it possible to identify four stable types of educational programs. The first cluster – theoretical and mathematical – is characterized by a high share of mathematical disciplines (47.6%) and is presented in classical universities. The second cluster – engineering and analytical – demonstrates a balanced combination of mathematics (26.6%) and applied aspects of data analysis (20.9% \"Software Engineering\"). The programs of the third cluster – applied development – are focused on practical skills (36.2% \"Software Engineering\"). The fourth cluster – innovative and technological – integrates advanced AI technologies (25.2% \"Computer Science\") with an interdisciplinary approach.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of smart vehicles equipped with advanced computing capabilities has enabled collaborative computing among vehicles, particularly through vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading, also known as peercloud-vehicle. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of vehicular environments presents significant security challenges, especially in trust management. Untrustworthy vehicles can cause unreliable task execution and introduce security vulnerabilities, ultimately compromising the efficiency and security of vehicle-to-vehicle offloading. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive trust management framework for vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading scenarios. The framework is designed to assess the trustworthiness of vehicles in order to enhance task offloading success rates by avoiding interactions with low-trust vehicles. Specifically, the framework includes two key components. First, we propose a decentralized trust propagation and aggregation mechanism that can adapt to the dynamic nature of vehicular environments. Second, we propose a trust-aware task allocation approach that integrates trust estimation with resource management to optimize task execution. Experimental results on both realworld and synthetic vehicular network datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework enables secure and efficient vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading by accurately estimating trust and significantly improving workload completion performance."

    "abstract": "Although it is very important for estimating air-sea and air-land carbon fluxes, vertical gradient of carbon dioxide in the near surface air were very hard to determine due to logistical difficulties. A few studies of the vertical gradient of cardon dioxide were conducted from airplane that offer poor vertical resolution and from towers that are available at limited locations. Recent developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV, i.e. drone) made it possible to carry physical and chemical sensors on a UAV to different altitudes for determining gradient of physical and chemical parameters. Here, we present some vertical profiles of carbon dioxide, water vapor, temperature, and relative humidity determined at: the Moana Loa Observatory, Hawaii; aboard R/V Kilo Moana at ALOHA Station in the North Pacific Ocean; Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; and Spruill Farm Conservation Project, North Carolina. Vertical profiles were observed at each site, and these vertical profiles of carbon dioxide were used to estimate near surface gradients of carbon dioxide. The gradient measured indicates that Mauna Loa is a source of carbon, the Spruill Farm and ALOHA Station is a sink of carbon, while Cape Hatteras is a source of carbon a few observation days and a sink of carbon most the other days during the study period."

Our method reformulates free-form queries into structured CLIP-aligned prompts, extracting key roles and filtering negations before injecting them into LERF. Experiments on descriptive, affordance, and negation benchmarks show clear improvements, achieving 95% accuracy on affordance queries and 88 % on negation handling over baseline LERF. IntentFuse enables intuitive, training-free, plug-andplay affordance grounding with applications in real-time robotic instruction following and AR/VR scene exploration, paving the way for more natural and interpretable human-environment interaction."

We also derive a formula to determine both the direction and stability of this bifurcation. In addition, we plot the bifurcation curves based on the original parameter settings of the IDTLN model, and these curves are visually presented in the corresponding bifurcation diagrams. Using numerical simulation examples, we not only verify our theoretical findings but also show the IDTLN model’s abundant, complex dynamical behaviors."

It further applies sectionlevel and integration-level prompts for layered knowledge extraction and employs a fusion mechanism to mitigate entity fragmentation and relation redundancy. Experiments on realworld reports demonstrate that AKG-Gen achieves substantial improvements in efficiency, fusion quality, and knowledge coverage compared with manual extraction, thereby enabling systematic accident cause analysis and supporting datadriven decision-making in aviation safety."

However, its unique device structure introduces new reliability challenges. This work investigates the role of substrate biasing on BDS lifetime. Experimental results show that devices with a floating substrate exhibit catastrophic failure within ~30 minutes of operation, while those with the substrate tied to the low-side source remain stable for more than 1000 hours. TCAD simulations reveal that under floating conditions the substrate self-biases to a positive potential, leading to intensified electric fields at the gate side of the device. This localized field intensification provides a direct explanation for the reported lifetime reduction. These results demonstrate that proper substrate biasing is essential for reliable operation of optimized BDS and point to dynamic clamping to the lowest source potential as the preferred solution for the studied device architecture."

    "abstract": "The paper presents a two-step approach to reduce the volume of the rare-earth permanent magnets (PMs) used in a small power permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) with 36 stator slots and 12 rotor surface-mounted PMs. In the first step, half of the PMs with the same polarity were replaced with steel, resulting in a machine with half the number of PMs but the same number of magnetic poles. In the second step, the shape of the PMs was optimized to ensure that the new motor produces the same torque as the initial PMSM. Finally, other optimization criteria were used to enhance the torque-magnet volume ratio of the newly designed PMSM. The study was conducted using Finite Element Method (FEM) models and specific optimization algorithms. To validate the models, both COMSOL Multiphysics and Altair Flux software were used, and the results were compared."

The sensor comprises two waveguides and a nanocavity ring resonator, with optimized hole radii to enhance key performance metrics. The refractive index of bio-samples at different concentrations is used to analyze the interaction between light and the analyte, leading to significant wavelength shifts and effective optical confinement. The band structure is analyzed using the plane-wave expansion method, while sensing parameters are evaluated using the finite-difference time-domain method.

In this paper, we investigate speech synthesis using the HiFi-GAN vocoder in conjunction with the Tacotron2 model. HiFi-GAN converts the mel-spectrograms produced by the sequence-to-sequence model Tacotron2 into high-fidelity audio waveforms. Using the LJSpeech dataset for training, we show how to apply these models. With an emphasis on the generated speech’s temporal coherence and perceptual quality, the synthesized audio is assessed both subjectively and objectively. The study also examines how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can improve the synthesis process in TTS systems, resulting in high-quality, real-time performance. Comparing the combined Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN approach to earlier techniques, experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in speech synthesis naturalness. Future developments in TTS systems, such as possible additions to multilingual synthesis and voice style transfer, are covered in the paper’s conclusion. Our system achieved a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.2/5 across 10 listeners (aged 18–25), with synthesis time averaging less than 2 seconds per sentence. Objective metrics such as Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) further confirm improvements over baseline model"

    "abstract": "Variational methods are widely used in the meteorological community to retrieve 3D-wind from single LiDAR observations, but the weights for loss function components are static and determined empirically, and iteratively minimizing the loss function is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method, the Model Function-based Multi-Regularization parameter selection with Adaptive Weights (MFMR-AW) for the background field components to overcome these challenges. MFMR-AW employs the multi-parameter regularization method to combine the Lidar observations with the background field. The combined effect of MFMR and AW determines the weights of background field components. Then the variational principle is used to transform the function minimization process into a system of linear equations, which can be well handled with the truncated singular value decomposition method. Simulations and field observations are employed to validate the proposed method. Results show that the mean RMSEs of MFMR-AW can be reduced by up to 66.9% compared to traditional assumption-based background fields, and the proposed method can get comparable or even superior accuracy with only about 1% of the computation cost of the traditional variational method."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image restoration (RSIR) is essential for recovering high-fidelity imagery from degraded observations, enabling accurate downstream analysis. However, most existing methods focus on single degradation types within homogeneous data, restricting their practicality in real-world scenarios where multiple degradations often across diverse spectral bands or sensor modalities, creating a significant operational bottleneck. To address this fundamental gap, we propose TGPNet, a unified framework capable of handling denoising, cloud removal, shadow removal, deblurring, and SAR despeckling within a single, unified architecture. The core of our framework is a novel Task-Guided Prompting (TGP) strategy. TGP leverages learnable, task-specific embeddings to generate degradation-aware cues, which then hierarchically modulate features throughout the decoder. This task-adaptive mechanism allows the network to precisely tailor its restoration process for distinct degradation patterns while maintaining a single set of shared weights. To validate our framework, we construct a unified RSIR benchmark covering RGB, multispectral, SAR, and thermal infrared modalities for five aforementioned restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TGPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both unified multi-task scenarios and unseen composite degradations, surpassing even specialized models in individual domains such as cloud removal. By successfully unifying heterogeneous degradation removal within a single adaptive framework, this work presents a significant advancement for multi-task RSIR, offering a practical and scalable solution for operational pipelines. The code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/huangwenwenlili/TGPNet."

    "abstract": "In OFDM wireless communications, power amplifier nonlinearity generates significant out-of-band (OOB) emissions and in-band distortion, conventionally requiring large power back-offs to address both issues simultaneously. We propose a forward distortion compensation (FDC) scheme using amplitude-phase-frequency block modulation (APFBM) that decouples OOB emission suppression from in-band distortion management, enabling reliable transmission even under severe power amplifier nonlinearity. At the transmitter, in-band distortion is intentionally introduced to facilitate aggressive OOB emission suppression, while APFBM manages bit mapping and imposes a power-sum constraint on information-carrying subcarriers. At the receiver, this power-sum constraint guides the compensation for in-band distortion, ensuring reliable information recovery. This compensation strategy also relaxes digital pre-distortion (DPD) accuracy requirements, permitting a simpler Sigmoid-based static DPD focused solely on OOB suppression and eliminating feedback circuits. The experimental results show a relative gain of 4.4 dB with a power back-off of 5.2 dB compared to nonlinear transmission based on quadrature amplitude modulation with equivalent processing at 4.9 GHz, while a relative gain of 2.6 dB is achieved at 26.5 GHz. This approach achieves superior energy efficiency and spectral efficiency trade-offs, enhancing coverage and performance in wireless communications."

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel stand-alone AR system“, Bionic AR.” This system integrates a head-mounted display (HMD) with biosignal-based human–computer interface (HCI) technology. By embedding passive dry electrodes into the proposed AR headset in contact areas such as the occipital area, brow ridge, and cheeks, the system can simultaneously record electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and facial electromyography (fEMG) data. The acquired multimodal biosignals were utilized to implement a steady-state visual evoked potential-based brain–computer interface (BCI), an eye-writing pattern recognition system, a facial expression recognition system, and a silent speech recognition system. In real-time experiments, each HCI module achieved accuracies exceeding 98%, underscoring the feasibility and practical potential of the proposed Bionic AR system."

This architecture integrates ferroelectric polarization and charge-trapping mechanisms within a tri-gate nanowire (fin) structure to achieve normally-off operation. Unlike conventional planar HEMTs, the tri-gate configuration exposes the 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel along the fin sidewalls, enabling effective depletion through trapped charges in the CTL, thereby achieving a high and stable threshold voltage (VTH). There is a possibility that incorporating fluorine into the HfO2 layer reduces oxygen vacancies and dangling bonds, significantly improving the dielectric interface and device reliability. At the dielectric/semiconductor interface, the interface trap density (Dit) was estimated to be 1×1011 to 1.2×1013 cm-2∙eV-1, as extracted using the frequency-dependent conductance method. The tri-gate device demonstrates an impressive VTH of 4.4 ± 0.2 V, IDS-MAX of 946 ± 10 mA/mm, breakdown voltage (BV) of 768 V, and a high-power figure-of-merit (PFOM) of 973 MW/cm2. Additionally, the device exhibits enhanced time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetime and gate stress resilience, confirming its superior performance and robustness for high-power applications."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has resulted in a significant increase in the number of low, slow, and small (LSS) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), raising critical challenges for secure airspace management and reliable trajectory planning. To address this, this paper proposes a cooperative radio-frequency (RF) detection and localization framework that leverages existing cellular base stations (BSs). The proposed approach features a robust scheme for LSS target identification, integrating a cell averaging-constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector with a micro- Doppler signature (MDS) based recognition method. Multi-station measurements are fused through a grid-based probabilistic algorithm combined with clustering techniques, effectively mitigating ghost targets and improving localization accuracy in multi-UAV scenarios. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a performance benchmark and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization is employed to balance localization accuracy against involved BS number. Simulation results demonstrate that increasing from one to multiple BSs can reduce the positioning error to near the CRLB, while practical experiments further verify the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based optimization can maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource usage, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for ensuring airspace safety in the emerging low-altitude economy."

A robust Direct Data Domain approach, using sparse recovery (D3-SR) STAP is proposed to realize robust clutter suppression under the multipath effect. Firstly, the D3-SR method is proposed to get a high-resolution clutter power spectrum, which effectively obtains spectrum estimation under the condition of minimal training samples. By setting a smoothing adaptive subspace, the Focal Underdetermined System Solver (FUSS) algorithm, which is used as the iterative algorithm in the D3-SR method, is improved to reduce the computational error and computational complexity. Then, the clutter covariance matrix (CCM) is obtained by the high-resolution clutter power spectrum of the improved D3-SR method, which solves the training sample shortage under the multipath effect. Based on the improved D3-SR method, the robust D3-SR-STAP is proposed to solve the target steering vector mismatch in STAP caused by the reflected signal of the multipath. By setting two-dimensional magnitude-phase constraints around the target angle-Doppler two-dimensional plain, the mainlobe of the STAP adaptive beamformer is maintained. This can effectively improve the STAP performance under the multipath effect in low-altitude environment. Simulation results validate the effectiveness that the robust STAP can achieve great performance of clutter suppression under the multipath effect."

However, it still remains a challenge to achieve natural and expressive synthesis for the Bangla language due to its complex phonetic structure, variable dialects, and lack of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Bangla TTS research to date, tracing the progression from traditional concatenative and parametric methods to most modern end-to-end neural frameworks, including autoregressive models (e.g., Tacotron), non-autoregressive models (e.g., FastSpeech 2), flow- and GAN-based architectures (e.g., VITS - Variational Inference TTS), diffusion-based approaches, and conversational systems such as ChatTTS.We synthesize insights from 13 state-of-the-art models to compare their architectural designs, prosody and speaker-control mechanisms, multilingual capabilities, and practical strengths and limitations. Finally, we provide a detailed overview of publicly available Bangla speech datasets, including the Bangla Speech Corpus, SUBESCO, Common Voice (Bangla), and SHRUTI Bengali, evaluating their suitability for expressive and high-quality speech synthesis. Open issues discussed include emotion modeling, addressing code-mixing, resource constraints, and issues of a lack of linguistic resources. This survey is not only a hefty review of the current pace/state of research, but it also identifies high-priority challenges, and valuable opportunities in the future, putting us on the pathway toward a more natural, expressive, and accessible Bangla Text-to-Speech system."

The basic ideology relies on a newly established time-transformation method that incorporates the classical adaptive technique, converting the prescribed-time stable control problem of the original system into an asymptotically stable problem of its time-transformed stretched form. Unlike the existing literature, the time transformation method in this article directly gives the adaptive laws before and after the time transformation, which greatly reduces the complexity of designing the adaptive prescribed-time controller due to the fact that the design of the adaptive law in the stretched time domain only needs to satisfy the asymptotic stability criterion. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated by a simulation example."

However, a key challenge to the practical deployment of current MER methods is the presence of varying noise levels and potential conflicts among modalities. Moreover, existing multimodal learning approaches usually evaluate modality quality from a global perspective, overlooking the inherent data quality biases present across different modalities. To this end, a multimodal adaptive reweighting strategy (Mars) is proposed, which combines an uncertainty weighting mechanism with a staged training framework for reliable multimodal fusion. Specifically, the proposed uncertainty weighting mechanism computes a dynamically scaled loss for each sample pair, enabling the model to automatically prioritize information from more reliable modalities while de-emphasizing less reliable ones from a sample perspective. The staged training framework initially emphasizes learning from the global sample distribution and gradually shifts focus to high-quality samples in later stages, thereby mitigating overfitting. This approach enhances the robustness of each modality and improves overall MER performance. Experimental results show that Mars outperforms baseline methods by 4.6% and 6.07% on the RAVDESS and FETE datasets, respectively, without introducing additional model parameters. The code of Mars is available at: https://github.com/AI-touch/Mars."

    "abstract": "Quantum communication systems support unique applications in the form of distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and several cryptographic protocols. The main enabler in these communication systems is an efficient infrastructure that is capable to transport unknown quantum states with high rate and fidelity. This feat requires a new approach to communication system design which efficiently exploits the available physical layer resources, while respecting the limitations and principles of quantum information. Despite the fundamental differences between the classic and quantum worlds, there exist universal communication concepts that may proven beneficial in quantum communication systems as well. In this survey, the distinctive aspects of physical layer quantum communications are highlighted in a attempt to draw commonalities and divergences between classic and quantum communications. More specifically, we begin by overviewing the quantum channels and use cases over diverse optical propagation media, shedding light on the concepts of crosstalk and interference. Subsequently, we survey quantum sources, detectors, channels and modulation techniques. More importantly, we discuss and analyze spatial multiplexing techniques, such as coherent control, multiplexing, diversity and MIMO. Finally, we identify synergies between the two communication technologies and grand open challenges that can be pivotal in the development of next-generation quantum communication systems."

However, the added cross coupling also facilitates the transmission of spurious modes, leading to significant spurious passbands and insufficient selectivity in the stopband. It has been challenging to address this problem effectively. In this letter, we propose a solution. By using the orthogonality of spurious modes and coupling paths, spurious modes can be naturally suppressed in both the main and cross-coupling paths, thereby suppressing spurious passbands and improving selectivity in the stopband. At the same time, the quasi-elliptic response remains unaffected, which can be designed as usual, and the structure change is very small without increasing the complexity compared with the conventional design. It should be effective for developing SIW filters in microwave and wireless circuits and systems."

The dataset, comprising 9,786 thermograms (8,192 healthy, 1,594 at-risk), is balanced using the SMOTE technique and validated through 5-fold stratified cross-validation. Results indicate an accuracy of 0.68, sensitivity of 0.81, and AUC ROC of 0.73, suggesting effective detection of positive cases but moderate specificity (0.54). These promising results open prospects for analyzing thermal variations in breast thermograms, though improvements are needed to optimize specificity."

    "abstract": "The Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem plays a crucial role in power system operations, ensuring voltage stability and minimizing power losses. Recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly within the \"learning to optimize\" framework, have enabled fast and efficient approximations of ORPD solutions, typically by training models on precomputed optimization results. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance on synthetic datasets, their effectiveness under real-world grid conditions remains largely unexplored. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a publicly available power system dataset that includes both the structural characteristics of a complete nation’s electrical grid (Uruguay), as well as nearly two years of real-world operational data, encompassing actual demand and generation profiles. Given Uruguay’s high penetration of renewable energy in this network, the ORPD problem has become the primary optimization challenge in its operation. Equipped with this data, and as a second contribution, we assess the impact of these real-world inputs on ML-based ORPD solutions, revealing a significant increase in prediction errors when transitioning from synthetic to actual demand and generation profiles. Our results highlight the limitations of existing models in learning under the complex statistical properties of real grid conditions and emphasize the need for more expressive architectures. By providing this dataset and the associated code, we aim to facilitate further research into robust ML-based optimization techniques for power system management."

While many maintain incident response plans (IRPs) to meet regulatory requirements, these plans are often untested and poorly integrated into operational workflows, resulting in delayed containment, unclear escalation, and inconsistent response actions. This disconnect between documentation and execution representing a critical readiness gap that can significantly increase the impact and duration of cyber events. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Incident Response Readiness Score (IRRS); a scenario-based assessment framework designed to empirically evaluate an organisation's incident response capability under simulated conditions. The IRRS applies a structured scoring rubric calibrated through a Scenario Risk Index, enabling proportional evaluation of performance across diverse incident types. By transforming qualitative incident response actions into a reproducible and risk-weighted metric, the IRRS offers a practical and scalable means of assessing and improving cybersecurity readiness for different type organisations."

The core of the system is a knowledge base implemented in the logic programming language Prolog, which formalizes lexical and morphological rules. The system architecture includes several modules for morphological analysis of different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, invariable words), with each module containing specialized rules for lemmatization, word form generation and grammatical category recognition. Specialized predicates have been developed to process dialect-specific phonetic and morphosyntactic phenomena (such as triple articulation in the Rhodope dialects). To ensure accessibility and interactivity, the system integrates a web server implemented entirely in Prolog. The main contribution of the work is in demonstrating the possibility of creating efficient intelligent natural language processing (NLP) systems with symbolic artificial intelligence methods requiring minimal computational resources. The project serves as a model for the application of logic programming in the humanities and digital cultural heritage."

    "abstract": "In oilfield production optimization, water flooding is a key technique to enhance recovery, and its seepage process is commonly modeled by the Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation. However, under planar radial flow conditions, the BL equation is challenging to solve due to its hyperbolic nature and shock formation. Traditional numerical methods are constrained by numerical dissipation and high computational costs, limiting predictive accuracy, while conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from unstable convergence near shocks, leading to poor accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a PINN framework integrated with a gated attention mechanism (Gated Attention-PINN). By introducing gated attention modules, the method strengthens feature interactions, significantly improves shock-capturing capability and convergence stability, and further enhances model interpretability. This work not only extends the applicability of PINNs to radial flow simulations but also provides a high-accuracy, stable, and interpretable tool for complex multiphase flow modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that Gated AttentionPINN outperforms standard PINN in both accuracy and convergence speed, achieving a 65% reduction in mean squared error and an increase in $R^{2}$ to over $95 \\%$."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of false positives and suboptimal detection performance due to a limited number of belt defect samples in existing belt defect detection methods, this paper proposes a belt defect detection method based on an improved unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN). This method primarily trains the model using images of defect-free belts, calculates outliers in the test set images, and distinguishes whether the samples have defects. The method combines an encoder and replaces its standard convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions to reduce detection time. In the discriminator, spectral norm normalization is used to stabilize model training. During the detection phase, the outlier calculation formula is improved, and the weighting of each loss component is redistributed to enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the accuracy (A) of the model on the belt data set is 98.67%, the probability of correct judgment of the value of the defective sample is higher than that of the normal sample (AUC) is 99.88%, and the average accuracy (AP) is 99.71%., outperforming the detection performance of DCGAN and f-AnoGAN under equivalent conditions. Additionally, the average detection time is reduced by 2.70% compared to f-AnoGAN. The experiments demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves good results in belt defect detection."

We formulate a Multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes task delay and energy consumption, thereby providing a set of Pareto-optimal solutions for practical deployment. To efficiently explore the highdimensional decision space, a group-based encoding strategy is proposed to reduce variable dimensionality. On this basis, we develop a hybrid optimization algorithm that integrates MultiObjective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)-assisted prediction mechanism, and an Adaptive Expansion Sampling (AES) strategy. The MOPSO framework serves as the global optimizer, while the BPNN module leverages learned task-performance mappings to predict convergence directions, and AES adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to single-objective optimization and weighted-sum methods, the proposed approach achieves superior trade-offs between latency and energy consumption, faster convergence speed, and better solution diversity. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework for efficient resource optimization in next-generation cloud-edge-terminal collaborative systems."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems that the membership function initialization of traditional training algorithms for Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems relies on prior knowledge and the generalization ability is limited by parameter settings, an improved MBGD-RDA algorithm based on fuzzy clustering (FC-MBGD-RDA) is proposed. This algorithm adopts Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to replace the manual initialization process of Gaussian membership function, and adaptively generates the membership degree distribution of the rule antecedent through a data-driven approach. It retains the mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD), L2 regularization, DropRule and AdaBound optimization strategies of the original algorithm, forming a TSK fuzzy system training framework with both adaptive rule generation and efficient parameter optimization. Experiments on 4 standard regression datasets show that FC-MBGD-RDA achieves a lower average test RMSE compared to the original MBGD-RDA. It converges faster on high-dimensional datasets and exhibits stronger robustness against hyperparameter variations."

Our hybrid pipeline combines the WISDM accelerometer dataset with contextual features derived from natural language wellness logs, enabling both accurate activity classification and personalized recommendation generation. The proposed late-fusion architecture achieves 98.2% accuracy for core activity recognition (Walking, Jogging, Sitting, Standing) while simultaneously providing contextually aware wellness recommendations. Through controlled experimental validation using synthetic wellness narratives, we demonstrate that incorporating LLM-extracted behavioral features (sleep patterns, fatigue levels, activity goals) significantly enhances the personalization capabilities of traditional sensor-based wellness systems. This work establishes a technical foundation for intelligent digital health assistants that bridges the gap between objective sensor measurements and subjective wellness experiences, while identifying critical research directions for real-world deployment."

However, it also instigates new security challenges distinctly from Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks which leads to disruption of network operations. In order to mitigate, prevent and detect DDoS attacks in autonomous EV networks, we proposed SafEV a Machine Learning (ML)-based framework using various ML models such as K-nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistics Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) and the SVM was found to be the most accurate classifier among them, distinguishing DDoS attacks with an accuracy of $95.50 \\%$. The model’s efficiency and accuracy demonstrates realtime attack detection and mitigation. To evaluate the SafEV framework’s efficiency, we use several performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1 -score, PR and ROC curves, which further emphasises the robustness and resilience of the system. The proposed SafEV framework provides an efficient method for sheltering Autonomous EV Networks, ensuring trustworthy and cautious operations within smart cities.

    "abstract": "Early detection of colorectal polyps is essential in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. And one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While colonoscopy remains the clinical gold standard for detection, at the same time, manual polyp segmentation introduces subjectivity and inefficiency. To address these challenges, this study presents the use of deep learning models PolypPVT, TransUNet, and Fine-Tuned UNet for automated polyp segmentation. Each model is evaluated under uniform training, augmentation, and evaluation conditions using the publicly available Kvasir-Seg dataset, which comprises 1000 annotated colonoscopy images. PolypPVT with Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) encoder achieved higher outcomes with Dice 0.94 and IoU 0.89. And a hybrid convolution-transformer model, TransUNet, obtains a Dice score of 0.91 and an IoU of 0.86. A refined UNet model with ResNet34 backbone with the scSE attention mechanism trails with a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.83. Results show that transformer-based models are more effective at capturing feature representation and enforcing boundary precision. The performance comparisons are also subject to visual overlays and learning curves. This work provides important considerations when deploying clinical AI models by revealing the strengths and trade-offs of the state-of-the-art segmentation architectures and facilitating more reliable and accurate polyp detection in clinical practice."

The prognosis of these deformities is clinically identified using plantar pressure maps from commercial setups is highly accurate, but was found to persist limited applicability due to lack of mobility and affordability. To address these challenges, a portable plantar pressure measurement setup has been developed and named as Portable Plantar Image Acquisition (PPIA) setup. This setup is able to capture a sequence of images during the stance phase of participants involved in the study. Furthermore, the analysis of the collected data is conducted from state-of-the art AI models involving Unet segmentation model [1] and the K-means clustering algorithm, differing from the previously explored portable setups. The study was conducted on 51 participants, including healthy and pathological feet involving flat and high arch conditions. The developed PPIA setup has achieved excellent results in mimicking the results of commercial systems for (1) foot type classification, with an accuracy of $92.15 \\%$, a precision of $83.38 \\%$, and a recall of $81.44 \\%$, and (2) plantar pressure distribution with mean squared error (MSE) values of $\\mathbf{1. 4 0 ~ f o r ~ t h e ~ f o r e f o o t ~ (F), ~} \\mathbf{1. 4 8}$ for the midfoot (M), and 3.02 for the heel (H) regions, respectively.

In this work, we propose a novel method, Wavelet-Enhanced Vision Transformer (WTViT), which integrates the multi-resolution analysis capability of wavelet transform with the powerful sequence modeling ability of Vision Transformer. By employing a wavelet transform convolution module, rich multi-scale time-frequency features of signals are effectively extracted, which are then processed by a Transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies and complex global structures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used RadioML 2018.01A dataset and a self-constructed supplementary dataset with broader modulation categories. The results demonstrate that WTViT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of $95.54 \\%$ and $97.96 \\%$, respectively, thereby confirming its robustness and strong generalization ability for AMC tasks."

This paper proposes an adaptive semantic communication system that dynamically adjusts the encoding strategy based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, we employ a deep neural encoder-decoder pipeline for the MNIST dataset, selectively applying compression and denoising based on SNR levels. Our experiments show that, for MNIST the reconstructed image has 94% classification accuracy even under compression rate of 0.1, for CIFAR-10 the reconstructed images are acceptable at 0.7 compression which saves 30% of data usage in image transferring. The proposed method is designed with vehicular networks in mind, where wireless channels are highly dynamic due to rapid mobility and frequent topology changes. Our system is salient when bandwidth is limited and unstable which is constantly occurring between vehicles and infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Object detection in real-world deployment often suffers from severe performance degradation due to domain shifts between training and test environments, such as drastic variations in style and illumination. This issue is particularly critical for safety-critical real-time applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by dynamically updating model parameters during inference without requiring source data or pre-collected target samples. However, existing TTA methods mainly target image classification, while their extension to object detection remains limited and is hindered by noisy pseudo-labels. To tackle this, we introduce a dynamic adaptive IoU thresholding mechanism that combines IoU across consecutive iterations (IoU-CI) and IoU among overlapping detections (IoU-OD). We further design a dynamic threshold adjustment strategy guided by iteration progress, detection confidence, and prediction uncertainty, enabling adaptive filtering and improved pseudo-label quality. Extensive experiments on multiple artistic-style datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-theart TTA baselines, boosting detection performance by over 4 mAP points (e.g., $23.17 \\%$ on Comic2k), and significantly enhancing pseudo-label reliability."

Traditionally pruning methods used weight ranking techniques and magnitude penalties to rate weights for later removal during the retraining phase of surviving weights. The process of network size reduction through neuron removal from the network forms part of pruning strategies. The weight selection process forms an optimization problem which aims to find specific weights that minimize misclassifications. The system has two new mechanisms for weight updating through chaos stimulation and it identifies causal weights that generate misclassifications. The network that undergoes pruning achieves its performance level with no reduction in explainability."

It supports independent, affordable yoga practices without expert supervision using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The proposed system uses webcam input to extract 33 body key points through the structure of mediapipe posture assessment. These traits can be categorized into five yoga poses, like downward dog, tree, warrior, plank and goddess pose etc using several controlled teaching methods. Among the assessed classifiers, the Support Vector Machines model reached the highest performance with 98% accuracy prior to Random Forest (97%), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (63%), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (28%). The SVM model is integrated into a flask based web application and provides real time feedback, user authentication, session monitoring, and personalized progress monitoring.

    "abstract": "Power failures and losses of the telecommunication network in disaster-prone areas negatively impact the response time for emergency operations, the provision of medical attention, and the coordination of the improvement unit. The conventional approaches to restoring connectivity, such as ground repair teams and the implementation of backup generators, are slow, resource-intensive, and hindered by access issues in numerous distant locations or places characterised by danger. The above constraints create a strong demand for a rapid adaptation and a swift, technology-oriented solution to bridge the significant gap between infrastructural downtime and complete revival. In resolving this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework that utilises an AI swarm of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with wireless power beaming technology, enabling the restoration of evanescent energy and real-time connectivity. It incorporates a swarm coordination algorithm, which utilises common forms of reinforcement, allowing drones to autonomously manage flight paths, allocate available power during dynamic changes in priority locations such as communication towers and hospitals, and adapt to changing demands and environmental factors. Wireless power beaming modules ensure that necessary facilities become operable again without the need for direct physical repair. At the same time, swarm intelligence ensures system redundancy and resilience, even in the event of drone failure. Simulation investigations in disaster conditions demonstrate that the proposed solution can decrease recovery time by over 60 per cent compared to traditional solutions, significantly increase power provision efficiency over the medium term, and offer a scalable solution with coverage across multiple facilities simultaneously. The framework ensures that lifelines essential to critical operations are not shut down at the time when they are needed most, just after a disaster, by concentrating on selective recovery to bring essential life support systems back online, in addition to the recovery of the entire grid. The findings indicate that AI-controlled swarms of drones are not only a cost-efficient and scalable solution but also an innovative approach to emergencies, as autonomous aerial systems become the bridge between the destruction of facilities and human survival."

Employing a mixed-methods approach, specifically an explanatory sequential design, the study first gathered quantitative data to identify trends in CSE among blind users, followed by qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews that explore experiences, highlighting the intersection of gender and CSE. This disparity is further explored in the qualitative phase, which uncovers factors contributing to the lower CSE among female blind users, including reduced familiarity with assistive technologies, limited previous internet use, and fewer opportunities for digital literacy training. The findings suggest that female blind users face more significant barriers to developing CSE, causing a gender digital divide. Access, lack of digital literacy programs, and tailored assistive technology training emerge as critical factors influencing CSE, particularly for women. By combining statistical trends with in-depth personal narratives, the study highlights the need for gender-sensitive interventions that support equitable digital inclusion for them."

Disease detection is essential for producing higher-quality and more abundant fruit. Early and accurate disease detection is essential for improving fruit production and minimizing economic losses. This research proposes an automated guava disease detection using EfficientNet-B3, a CNN algorithm known for its accuracy and computational efficiency. Two publicly available datasets from Mendeley and Kaggle were used to fit the model. The dataset contains images of six guava diseases named Red Rust, Phytophthora, Stylar End Rot, Anthracnose, Scab, and Fruit Fly as well as healthy guavas. Several image preprocessing was to improve the model generalization. In this paper, EfficientNet-B3 model achieved a classification accuracy of $99 \\%$. Additionally, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were used to validate the model’s performance across different disease categories. Comparing manual disease inspection, this automated system reduces human effort, enhances diagnostic accuracy, and can be deployed in real-world agricultural applications, including smartphone-based disease detection tools and precision farming solutions.

Prototypes were fabricated on FR-4, RT/Duroid 5880, and Rogers RO3210 substrates, each realized in parallel with intact and defected ground planes. Measured results confirmed the simulations, showing that DGS introduces additional transmission zeros, enhances stopband attenuation by up to 30 dB, and improves selectivity with limited insertion loss penalty. Substrate properties were found to significantly influence matching, bandwidth, and quality factor, while maintaining mechanical stability above 12 GHz. The outcomes demonstrate that integrating DGS into microstrip filters provides a cost-effective strategy for miniaturization and performance enhancement, ensuring suitability for compact RF front ends in emerging 5G/6G wireless communication systems."

This paper introduces a cost-effective microcontrollerbased smart home system that integrates lighting, fan, and airconditioning control into a unified platform. By leveraging realtime sensor data and user input, the system dynamically adjusts appliances to balance comfort with energy savings. Unlike solutions requiring cloud connectivity or complex AI frameworks, the proposed approach uses a standalone Arduino-based controller and simple control logic to achieve intelligent automation. This simplicity allows significant energy savings-reducing lighting and HVAC power consumption comparable to more complex AI-driven systems yet attainable with low-cost, readily available components. The novelty of the system lies in its holistic integration of multi-appliance control under a single microcontroller with adaptive, user-centric operation. The proposed system has significant implications for resource-constrained regions by enabling affordable, sustainable automation that reduces electricity costs and improves user comfort without the need for expensive infrastructure. The result is a scalable and practical smart home solution that advances accessibility, sustainability, and comfort."

However, the high computational cost of training candidate architectures greatly limits the efficiency of conventional approaches. This paper proposes GLC-NAS, a novel NAS method that employs Tournament Learning Competitive Swarm Optimization (TLCSO) with a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based surrogate model. Within GLCNAS, a TLCSO method is proposed to improve optimization performance by incorporating tournament selection, local search, elitism strategies, and competition-driven learning. In addition, to mitigate the need for extensive training and alleviate computational bottlenecks, a GNN predictor is employed as an evaluation module during the TLCSO search process, thereby enabling efficient and reliable performance estimation for candidate architectures. The experimental results in the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that GLCNAS reduces search time from several days to only minutes. GLC-NAS achieves faster convergence and identifies superior architectures, providing an efficient and practical solution for the design of automated neural architectures."

    "abstract": "In recent years, network traffic analysis solutions that are driven by artificial intelligence models have achieved impressive performance. The “magic spells” of these solutions come from the knowledge that they learn from large amounts of network traffic data. However, these solutions neglect the impact of the real-world network's complexity on data quality, which makes the knowledge they learn from regular network traffic data difficult to be effective on low-quality data. Considering the packet loss in real-world network environments, this paper presents TFMana to calibrate the inaccurate packet length features extracted from incomplete network traffic data. TFMana utilizes an encoder-based masked language model to predict features of lost packets, incorporating network traffic feature embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. This approach enables the calibrated features to approximate those extracted from loss-free network traffic asymptotically. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The evaluation demonstrates that TFMana's calibration achieves recovery accuracy between 83.94 % and 85.66 %, with minimal sensitivity to packet loss rates. Integrated with four benchmark application identification models, TFMana significantly improves classification accuracy under packet loss conditions. Notably, the analysis models maintains reliable performance even at high packet loss rates of 30 %."

The SmartAV-RescueSense system is presented here as a multi-sensor and artificial intelligence framework made to help AVs notice and answer to emergency vehicles right away. With the help of its new fusion engine, the system combines microphone signals from different directions and all-around cameras to properly sense sirens and emergency signs, regardless of whether it’s noisy or hard to see. Because of the module, emergency signals are quickly recognized and the system functions well without the need for online storage or processing. Besides, the platform uses the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) protocol to obtain live warnings from equipped emergency vehicles, allowing AVs to act safely and efficiently. Thanks to its reinforcement learning structure, the dynamic path model directs AVs to give way or change their route in the best way given the situation and the urban environment. The approach also makes use of mapped priority regions over time to anticipate the route of an emergency vehicle in a busy city grid. Simulations of many different emergencies at the same time confirm that the system works well and responds promptly. It shows that this method represents considerable advantages in accuracy, time for response, and safety over older technologies. thanks to this research, urban traffic safety is increasing and these cars can live side by side smoothly.

Traditional cognitive diagnostic models usually analyze the linear relationship between students and exercises by manually designing functions, but this approach is difficult to adequately capture the rich content closely related to foreign language exercises. To address this problem, this paper proposes a generalized cognitive diagnosis model called the Attention Cognitive Diagnosis Kolmogorov-Arnold Net (ACDKAN). This model incorporates advanced modules from the field of machine vision. It extends the Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to ensure the interpretability of factor vectors and to effectively explore the semantic information within foreign language exercises. By studying the precedence relations between knowledge concepts, ACDKAN reveals the complexity of targeted knowledge concepts and enhances the learning ability of exercise feature vectors. Experimental results based on real foreign language exercises datasets show that ACDKAN model proposed in the paper outperforms other advanced cognitive diagnostic methods."

    "abstract": "We present a novel dataset designed to support the development and evaluation of audio restoration techniques focused on historical music recordings. The dataset comprises over 800 audio excerpts, including musicological tape recordings, isolated tape hiss segments, and pitchpipe tones used as tuning references. Each fragment is annotated with metadata such as instrument presence, year of recording, and tape reel number. The dataset enables a variety of restoration-related tasks, including denoising, noise profiling, instrument detection, and segmentation. We also provide baseline results for denoising using state-of-the-art deep learning models and demonstrate an application for playback speed correction using Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) analysis. Our goal is to contribute to the preservation of audio heritage by facilitating reproducible research and benchmarking in music restoration."

Traditional analysis methods focus on topological and statistical properties of these graphs, but recent advances in computer vision provide new avenues for structural recognition. This paper presents a system for visualizing Bitcoin transaction graphs and analyzing them through image comparison techniques. Using modular JavaScript tools, the system parses transaction data, generates address-level graphs, renders them as images, and applies pixel-based similarity metrics to identify structural patterns. The evaluation shows that visually similar transaction types yield high similarity scores, while outliers are effectively distinguished. The results support the viability of image-based graph analysis as a supplementary method for blockchain transaction monitoring and anomaly detection."

The results indicate that while IP-based architectures remain dominant due to their ubiquity and stability, they face growing challenges in areas such as Internet of Things (IoT) scalability, mobility, and security. Non-IP architectures, particularly ICN/NDN, offer built-in security mechanisms, efficient content distribution, and enhanced mobility support, yet they face significant challenges related to compatibility and ecosystem maturity. The comparative analysis emphasizes that the future of networking will likely involve hybrid models and the gradual adoption of non-IP paradigms in niche domains before broader acceptance."

State-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We investigate physicsinformed neural operator learning models as efficient supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet) on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operatorsupervised approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766 vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization coefficient and decreasing training overhead by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 \\%}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "Prestack seismic inversion, as a quantitative interpretation method, can integrate multiple information under Bayesian theory framework to obtain the posterior probability density functions of elastic parameters for reservoir prediction. Particle filtering (PF) algorithm is a popular method for solving nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems, and can achieve promising results in prestack inversion. However, in traditional PF algorithms, even with the introduction of various resampling methods, the problem of particle impoverishment still exists, leading to inaccurate inversion results. To solve this problem, in this paper, the black-winged kite algorithm is used to replace the resampling process, and a black-winged kite particle filtering algorithm nonlinear prestack inversion method is proposed. This method overcomes the particle impoverishment problem and improves the inversion accuracy. We test the performance of our proposed method from both synthetic noisy data and a real dataset. Moreover, comparison with the whale optimization particle filter method shows that our proposed method can achieve higher inversion accuracy of elastic parameters."

    "abstract": "This article presents a decentralized dynamic event-sampled control (ESC) strategy for multi-unit power systems (MUPSs) subject to mismatched interconnections. Initially, with the introduction of a dynamic event-sampling mechanism, the decentralized ESC problem of MUPSs is converted into a set of event-sampled optimal control problems of auxiliary subsystems. It is demonstrated that all the solutions of the event-sampled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations (ES-HJBEs) arising in these optimal control problems together constitute the decentralized dynamic ESC law. Then, in order to solve the ES-HJBEs, the critic neural networks (CNNs) within the adaptive dynamic programming framework are constructed. The CNNs’ weights are updated via simultaneously using the gradient descent method and concurrent learning. The benefits of such a tuning rule are that it not only makes full use of state data (including historical and instantaneous state data) but also no longer requires the persistence of excitation condition. Moreover, uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop auxiliary subsystem states and the CNNs’ weight estimation errors are proved via Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations of a three-unit power system are given to validate the present decentralized dynamic ESC scheme."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR). However, data-driven methods suffer from spurious correlations that conflate target attributes with confounding factors limiting generalization and robustness in complex conditions. The attribute scattering center (ASC) model, which can map SAR data to physically interpretable features, offers insights for addressing the aforementioned problem. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-granularity feature fusion network (MgFFNet) leveraging ASC to realize robust and interpretable target recognition in complex scenarios. First, we extract multi-granularity scattering features based on ASC model including scattering points feature and component feature. On this basis, we develop a multi-granularity deep feature embedding module that leverages scattering features to hierarchically guide vision features toward causally interpretable representations. Finally, we propose a multi-granularity feature fusion module to achieve different features aggregation, so as to facilitate target identity decision making. Evaluation experiments on two publicly released datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses numerous advanced SAR ATR methods."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "We study how to schedule data sources in a wireless time-sensitive information system with multiple heterogeneous and unreliable channels to minimize the total expected Age-of-Information (AoI). Although one could formulate this problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP), such an approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality and lack of insights. For single-channel systems, prior studies have developed lower-complexity solutions based on the Whittle index. However, Whittle index has not been studied for systems with multiple heterogeneous channels, mainly because indexability is not well defined when there are multiple dual cost values, one for each channel. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce new notions of partial indexability and partial index, which are defined with respect to one channel’s cost, given all other channels’ costs. We then combine the ideas of partial indices and max-weight matching to develop a Sum Weighted Index Matching (SWIM) policy, which iteratively updates the dual costs and partial indices. The proposed policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in minimizing the total expected AoI, under a technical condition on a global attractor property. We also propose an interpolation-based algorithm to quickly compute (approximate) partial indices in real time. Extensive performance simulations demonstrate that the proposed policy offers significant gains over conventional approaches by achieving a near-optimal AoI. Further, the notion of partial index is of independent interest and could be useful for other problems with multiple heterogeneous resources."

The additional interconnect layer required for the bottom device in CFET results in a more complex distribution of parasitic capacitance. In this article, we propose a strategy to extract the parasitic capacitance of CFET in standard cell (SDC). Considering the unique multilayer structure of CFET and the practical requirements for circuit design, the interconnections between gates can be categorized into five distinct configurations. Each configuration is further divided into three styles. The capacitance associated with the fixed-style part remains unchanged regardless of design variations and should be included in the compact model of the transistor. Each style is modeled using analytical approaches. For the first time, we evaluate the parasitic capacitance between the interconnections of PFET and NFET in CFET. The comparison between the model and numerical field solver simulation results, along with the transient simulation results obtained by applying the proposed strategy to circuits, comprehensively validates both the feasibility of the strategy and the accuracy of the model."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of 6G networks and AI-generated content (AIGC) is reshaping service provisioning at the wireless edge, where low-latency and computation-intensive tasks must be efficiently supported. Integrating AIGC with 6G Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems offers significant benefits, enabling real-time analytics, IoT data augmentation and synthesis, personalized services, and intelligent resource coordination across heterogeneous devices. However, provisioning AIGC services at the mobile edge poses formidable challenges: massive data heterogeneity, stringent delay requirements, and the inherent limitations of learning-based offloading methods, such as high training cost, unstable convergence, and weak transparency. Inspired by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we propose a hybrid optimization framework that combines classical wireless bandwidth pre-allocation for IoT devices connected to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)-based AIGC server selection. This hybrid classical-quantum design ensures stable results and enables efficient exploration of combinatorial allocation spaces. We further implement the quantum circuits and evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. Simulation results show that our method achieves lower processing latency and greater stability than conventional reinforcement learning and heuristic baselines in small- to medium-scale IoT deployments. While current quantum hardware scalability remains a constraint, the framework points toward a promising pathway for large-scale AIGC offloading as quantum technology matures."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2025.3649287",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Compared to traditional mass production, customized discrete manufacturing—such as furniture panel production—generates massive, heterogeneous, and highly dynamic data throughout its lifecycle (order processing, process design, manufacturing execution). Storing this complex, interconnected lifecycle data in traditional relational databases suffers from high redundancy, weak relevance, dispersed distribution, and storage limitations. To address this, this paper proposes a generalizable knowledge graph-based method for knowledge modeling and fusion with semi-dynamic update capability in customized manufacturing, demonstrated through a case study in custom furniture panel production. Firstly, three ontology models (process, resource, feature) are constructed to structurally represent multi-source production knowledge, resolving issues of high redundancy and weak semantic associations found in traditional databases. Secondly, a bidirectional KG construction method is proposed, integrating top-down ontology modeling with bottom-up entity mining for effective dynamic knowledge integration. Thirdly, a graph embedding-based multi-dimensional knowledge fusion algorithm is designed, combined with order-based Knowledge Graph Fragment (KGF) models, to enable semantic association and reasoning of knowledge nodes across processes. A case study in a furniture factory validated the method, building a KG from the ontology models, confirming the fusion method's effectiveness in significantly improving production knowledge manageability and application efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome limitations (e.g., insufficient intent recognition, generalization) of pure knowledge graph-based QA systems, the constructed knowledge graph was integrated with the DeepSeek Large Language Model (LLM). This integration employs ontology-driven prompting and leverages the LoRA lightweight fine-tuning of the DeepSeek-LLM-7B-Chat. This KG–LLM fusion approach for customized manufacturing QA generates more domain-specific and professional responses than methods using solely LLM or KG. The proposed framework provides effective support for intelligent decision-making and optimization in mass-customization production environments, with validated efficacy in the furniture domain."

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is essential in city-level applications, where data-driven deep learning has become the most popular method. However, sufficient data in developing cities is not always accessible, posing a challenge for training effective models in scenarios with limited data. Recently, several works have promoted this issue through cross-city knowledge transfer and shown promising performances. However, existing methods can neither distinguish node divergence nor extract functional similarities between cities, which results in suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitations, we propose a Cross-city Correlation Learning (CCL) framework. Firstly, we construct a self-supervised learning model to infer accurate node-to-node and node-to-region cross-city correlations from multiple noisy labels without using any auxiliary information. Then, we achieve spatial knowledge transfer from a transfer-adaptive graph convolution network based on the learned correlations in two aspects: the learnable adjacency matrix and region-specific kernel parameters, which ensure the target models can transfer more and better utilize the knowledge from the source domain. The experiments are conducted on six real-world datasets and fully prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Distributed energy scheduling in residential microgrids faces challenges from renewable uncertainty and privacy constraints. While multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables decentralized coordination, classical MARL methods suffer from exponential growth in the joint state–action space, leading to high computational complexity and low sample efficiency. Moreover, centralized training paradigms often rely on shared representations, raising privacy concerns. In this article, we propose a multiagent distributional reinforcement learning framework with the dynamic hyper policy network (DHPN), which constructs permutation-invariant (PI) representations via entitywise dynamic weight generation and multihead attention, reducing input redundancy and obviating the need for full joint information. To capture stochasticity from renewable variability and demand, we further introduce a distributional value function factorization framework to model return distributions, leveraging quantile regression and mean–shape decomposition. Experiments on a data-driven microgrid demonstrate that the DHPN outperforms strong baselines by achieving substantially lower mean-square error in representational evaluation and higher cumulative rewards, while exhibiting faster convergence, enhanced training stability, and reduced grid fluctuations. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining PI representations with distributional value modeling for scalable privacy-aware multiagent energy management."

    "abstract": "Neutron radiography is a well-established non-destructive testing technique, but it remains insufficient to meet the demands of high-resolution imaging, particularly when based on a compact neutron source. Real-ESRGAN, a powerful image super-resolution method based on a generative adversarial network, is extended in this study to practical high-resolution restoration applications in neutron radiography. The complex degradation factors in neutron radiography (e.g., blur, noise, and gamma white spots) are considered to enhance the generalization ability of the super-resolution network for neutron image data. Thereafter, the U-Net discriminator is integrated with attention gates to enable the super-resolution network to focus on important features and suppress irrelevant information. To balance the cost and reliability of dataset construction, X-ray images are used as data drivers for model training. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method reconstructs high-resolution neutron radiographs with sharper texture details and less noise than state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques, in terms of both visual quality and quantity."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power, offering unprecedented potential for optimizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in telecommunications. This paper explores the application of quantum computing to telecom KPI optimization, contrasting its capabilities with those of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Telecom networks face increasing complexity due to rising data demands, 5 G deployment, and user expectations, necessitating advanced optimization techniques beyond traditional methods. While generative AI has shown promise in modeling network behaviour and predicting KPIs, it struggles with scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale, real-time systems. Quantum computing, leveraging principles like superposition and entanglement, excels in solving combinatorial optimization problems inherent in telecom networks, such as resource allocation and latency reduction. Through a detailed comparison, this paper highlights quantum computing’s superior speed, precision, and ability to handle multi-dimensional KPI datasets. A conceptual quantum framework for telecom optimization is proposed, supported by theoretical examples. The study concludes that while generative AI offers flexibility, quantum computing provides transformative advantages for future telecom systems, paving the way for nextgeneration network efficiency. Challenges such as hardware limitations and algorithm development are also discussed, alongside future research directions."

However, existing approaches suffer from scalability issues and may perform poorly on large graphs. This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of the PR algorithm on GPUs, presenting several implementation and parallelization improvements compared to the state of the art.

This study presents a machine learning (ML) framework for identifying subcortical white matter biomarkers associated with verbal episodic memory impairment utilizing diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). A total of 93 participants (58 RRMS patients with cognitive preservation (RRMS-CP) and with cognitive impairment (RRMS-CI), and 35 healthy controls with cognitive preservation (HC-CP) were evaluated using the Auditory Verbal Learning Test and stratified into three cognitive groups. U-fiber diffusivity metrics—including fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity—were extracted from 100 white matter regions. Feature selection via Sequential Forward Selection was combined with multiple classifiers, including Random Forest and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our models achieved up to 100% accuracy (sensitivity: 98.64%, specificity: 98.17%) in distinguishing between HC-CP and RRMS-CP patients, 96.37% accuracy (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 97.50%) between HC-CP and RRMS-CI, 97.23% accuracy (sensitivity: 98.75%, specificity: 96.00%) between RRMS-CP and RRMS-CI, and 89.2% accuracy (sensitivity: 91.09%, specificity: 91.58%) across all three groups. We acknowledge limitations, including potential information leakage in feature selection, limited diffusion directions, and the need for advanced preprocessing pipelines. These limitations will be addressed in future work with larger cohorts and nested cross-validation.

    "abstract": "The increasing rate of motorcycle theft, particularly in urban environments, highlights the urgent need for modern, intelligent security solutions. Traditional physical locks and alarms are no longer sufficient to deter sophisticated theft methods. This paper presents the design and implementation of a motorcycle anti-theft system utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology integrated with the ESP32 micro-controller. The system replaces traditional ignition keys with proximity-based authentication, enabling ignition only when a registered BLE device (e.g., an iTag or smartwatch) is detected within a predefined signal strength threshold, verified through its MAC address and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). he hardware design incorporates an ESP32 board, a relay module, a buzzer, and status LEDs, all powered by the vehicle’s 12V supply and optimized for low-power operation. System software was developed using the Arduino IDE, and real- time BLE scanning was implemented with RSI-based filtering. Experiments conducted in controlled and real-world environments tested BLE detection range, response time, and system stability. Results demonstrated reliable performance up to 5 meters, with response times ranging from 1.8 to 2.8 seconds depending on the BLE device type and condition. The system successfully prevented engine activation when unauthorized devices were present or when the BLE signal dropped below the threshold. This research contributes a low-cost, energy-efficient, and scalable platform to the field of IoT-based vehicle security, with a clear pathway for future integration of GPS, mobile applications, and cloud-based monitoring for comprehensive protection."

    "abstract": "Urban zones are experiencing additional energy needs, with the conventional power sources failing to provide for the rapidly expanding populations at the expense of the environment. Street lights, traffic signals, and other public infrastructure require a continuous power supply, typically from the grid. However, the conservation systems are not sustainable and even contribute to the Carbon footprint. This paper gives a solution to this problem by introducing a Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Footpath (PEHF) system. The PEHF capitalises on pedestrian foot traffic to generate clean, renewable electricity via embedded piezoelectric transducers in the footpath tiles. The system harvests mechanical energy from footsteps and converts it to electrical power, which is stored and delivered to streetlights, environmental sensors, or other infrastructure. A real-time adaptive power optimisation algorithm (RAPOA) is proposed to control energy harvesting, enhance detection accuracy, and optimise energy storage. The system's architecture combines piezoelectric materials, energy management circuits, and the IoT for monitoring and data transmission, making it scalable for urban use. The PEHF had a power density of 1.2 W/m 2, 97-98% of the step detection and 15% step energy conversion efficiency, 25-35 times better than the existing systems in voltage output and 20 times in lifetime. The system achieves a step-detection accuracy of 97-98%, enabling reliable energy generation. The suggested solution is eco-friendly and cost-effective, serving as a sustainable power supply for urban infrastructure and promoting innovative city development. In summary, the PEHF system provides a scalable solution for efficiently using pedestrian energy, reducing reliance on conventional power sources and enhancing sustainability in urban settings."

The proposed HCMAN module uses convolutional self-attention to combine information across feature maps of different resolution. It is lightweight and can be easily integrated into the feature extractor of many available cross-modal target Re-ID architectures with negligible overhead. HCMAN requires no special handling, being optimized by end-to-end training of the Re-ID pipeline. We demonstrate improved performance of multiple state-of-the-art ReID methods through the integration of HCMAN.

Among the large-scale current systems in the magnetosphere, the ring current-a westwardflowing current-plays a central role in geomagnetic variations through its close relation to space weather. In this study, we apply the curlometer technique to perform a statistical analysis of ring current observations of Cluster in 2002. The current determinations are validated with the Dst index, which quantifies variations in Earth’s surface magnetic field. Besides, we analyze the impact of geometric parameters of the satellite configuration (separation, planarity, and elongation) and the physical validity criterion ($Q=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} / \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$) on the reliability of the measured current densities."

Defect detection is vital for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of materials and structures across industries, as undetected flaws such as cracks or voids can compromise structural integrity and lead to catastrophic failures. Near-field imaging in the microwave region addresses these challenges by offering higher resolution, enhanced sensitivity, and the ability to detect both surface and subsurface defects with precision. SFTR further enhances near-field imaging by focusing energy at defect locations, suppressing noise, and improving signal-to-noise ratios. This synergy captures fine details, including evanescent waves, which are crucial for detecting subtle defects. The combination of highresolution imaging and advanced signal processing in near-field imaging based on SFTR presents a robust, reliable, and versatile solution for overcoming the limitations of traditional defect detection methods."

In this work, we provide a brief overview of current methods and discuss ways for addressing class imbalance in the audio domain especially. To further understand the impact of our suggested approach, we additionally conduct several tests on two purposefully imbalanced datasets (cats vs. dogs and major vs. minor chords) using three distinct audio representations. On both datasets, we find that the augmentation applied to spectrogram-based representations performs better than the other two approaches."

Current monitoring determines the quality of mastering the current study sections—current performance. Periodic monitoring is aimed at determining intermediate performance and is conducted over an entire course section at times scheduled by the teacher or educational institution, with the purpose of assessing the quality of material assimilation and, if necessary, adjusting the student's performance trajectory. The article proposes an algorithm to automate the management of current performance based on the analysis of the dynamics of a student’s grades accumulated up to the next periodic monitoring point. The goal of the algorithm is to provide the teacher with a timely signal that the student needs learning process correction. As a model for analyzing current performance, a model of discrete Markov chains with fuzzy states and the Kolmogorov–Chapman formula is proposed. The fuzzy states of student performance characterize the degree of mastery of different sections of the curriculum. Using discrete Markov chains with fuzzy states allows solving the following tasks: automatic classification of the degree of mastery of a course section at the current moment, considering the dynamics of the student's academic results; the classification is performed based on a relatively small amount of current performance grades."

Although the database is based on the same principles and rules, the geometric accuracy of the database is not homogeneous due to different data sources. The introduction of electronic land registries does not in itself solve mapping errors, but poses new challenges. This paper attempts to summarize the reasons for the inhomogeneity of mapping accuracy and guidelines for correcting errors that exceed tolerances. The research demonstrates a strong correlation between survey age and error correction frequency, with maps from the 19th and early 20th centuries showing significantly higher correction rates compared to modern surveys."

    "abstract": "To address engineering challenges such as multi-constraint conflicts, nonlinear coupling, and high material costs, this paper proposes a Multi-Strategy Enhanced Slime Mould Algorithm (MESMA) for parameter optimization, aiming to achieve cost-effective and reliable solutions. Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) is limited by slow convergence, low precision, and a high risk of local optima entrapment. These drawbacks are mitigated in MESMA through the integration of multiple strategies: the pinhole imaging inverse learning mechanism enhances search capability; individual mutation helps avoid premature convergence; and greedy selection ensures that superior solutions are retained. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate that MESMA outperforms not only existing state-of-the-art algorithms but also enhanced variants of the SMA. Moreover, case studies on three engineering design problems confirm its feasibility and robustness in practical engineering applications."

    "abstract": "By advising and teaching farmers on how to apply modern farm practices that embrace Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), precision agriculture is revolutionising sustainable farming by optimising for usages that are as much as possible and waste as little as can be afforded. In this research, we propose an AIoT-driven Smart Agri Grid (ASAG) framework that integrates real-time nanosensor networks, an AI-operational control microclimate, an autonomous decision-support system, and secure data sharing via a blockchain using encrypted statistical data. To achieve real-time analytics, edge computing is used in the framework for real-time data analytics, predictive algorithms for dynamic irrigation & nutrient management, and federated learning for distributed AI training, which maintains privacy and scalability. In addition, the system uses AI-based waste-minimisation techniques, such as predictive harvest timing and the conversion of bio-waste into organic fertilisers, thereby reducing post-harvest losses. Experimental results show that ASAG can improve crop yield by 20 to 30%, reduce water waste by up to 50%, and reduce chemical overuse by up to 30%, with its economic and environmental benefits. The feasibility of such deployment on a large scale in precision agriculture is further confirmed by a cost-benefit analysis. The results reinforce the power of AI and IoT in transforming contemporary farming into a self-optimising, climate-resilient system. For long-term sustainability in global agriculture, quantum AI will be used to predict soil health, monitor AI-assisted carbon sequestration, and enable genomic AI for climate-resistant crops."

To address this issue, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have emerged as a promising solution, enabling real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure to enhance road safety. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular environments, particularly the Doppler Effect (DE), poses significant challenges to reliable communication in VANETs. This study proposes a Neural Network (NN)-based approach combined with a Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) optimization algorithm to predict the optimal Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and relative node mobility. Simulation results demonstrate the model’s robustness, achieving an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8%. The proposed solution not only mitigates the impact of the Doppler Effect but also enhances the reliability and efficiency of safety message transmission in high-mobility scenarios, contributing to improved road safety and the overall effectiveness of VANETs."

The survey was conducted along 19 transects in the Baranangsiang area utilizing the MALÅ Easy Locator Core system operating at 450 MHz. Radargram data were processed through noise filtering, amplitude normalization, and static correction to enhance clarity and interpretability. Hyperbolic reflections in the radargrams were used to identify discrete underground objects, while planar reflectors represented soil layers. The depth of identified utilities ranged from approximately 0.12 m to 3.00 m, depending on the type and installation standard. The results confirm that GPR is a reliable and non-destructive method for detecting underground utilities with varying material properties and depths. This research supports the development of utility maps and contributes to the integration of geospatial data into sustainable urban infrastructure planning in Bogor City."

Electromagnetic simulations evaluated field symmetry, circular polarization, and safety parameters, including specific absorption rate (SAR) and thermal effects. Comparative results between 8-rung and 12-rung coil configurations demonstrated that the 8-rung design ensures optimal field symmetry and SAR compliance, while the 12-rung design increases local absorption beyond recommended safety thresholds.

The state space model of the nonlinear system is first established, and the UKF prediction step constructs input features for long short term memory network to adaptively estimate the noise covariance. Subsequently, the UKF performs real-time updates of system states and fault estimates. These updated values are utilized as loss functions to facilitate end-to-end training of the network. During the training process, a joint target loss function is proposed, and truncated backpropagation through time is adopted to enhance training efficiency. Finally, numerical simulation experiment is conducted which has proved that the estimation accuracy of the hybrid filter is higher than the standard UKF and the extended Kalman filter under unknown noise covariance."

The proposed coupler differs from the conventional design with respect to length of the transmission line. This paper discusses two BLCs. The first coupler is constructed without a stub and it works for a particular frequency ratio of $\\mathbf{2}(\\mathbf{1. 1 5 ~ G H z} / \\mathbf{2 . 3 ~ G H z})$. In the second coupler design, stubs that are center-tapped in the horizontal (series) arms of the coupler are used $(0.92 \\mathrm{GHz} / 2.4 \\mathrm{GHz})$. These stubs help in widening the two frequencies of operation by increasing the frequency ratio to 2.6. The coupler designed with stubs can be used to operate at desired frequencies by parameterizing the stub length.

Virtualized radio access networks (VRANs) are a new paradigm that brings software-based network functions to run on the cloud. In this paper, we propose four LDPC soft decoder approximations: a piecewise linear (PL) approximation, a polynomial approximation, a machine learning (ML) based approximation, and a modification of min-sum approximation using regression methods. We show that the approximations retain a comparable BLER performance and, at the same time, bring down the computational complexity of the decoder. We also show that the BLER performance of our approximations is significantly better than the well-known min-sum approximation. Our methods are suitable for direct implementation in cloud based VRAN systems."

Using the optimized process, 1.2 kV/164 A full-SiC MOSFET half-bridge prototypes were assembled. Static and dynamic evaluations confirm that the refined process effectively supports reliable DSC module realization."

    "abstract": "Volunteered geographic information (VGI) provides an efficient means of generating large-scale labels for building extraction from remote sensing imagery. However, the inherent noise in these labels often compromises the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Existing label correction methods heavily rely on unreliable early-stage predictions and are prone to error accumulation, which impedes their performance in building extraction tasks, particularly in complex scenes with localized noisy labels. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Multiview Collaborative Learning (MCL) framework that enables robust DCNN training for building extraction tasks under noisy supervision. MCL introduces multiview predicted probabilities produced by multiple late-stage networks, offering more reliable and diverse priors for correcting noisy labels. A Hidden Denoising Inference Model (HDIM) is further developed to infer latent clean labels by modeling the confidence of multiview predictions through an EM-based optimization process. Additionally, a Syloss function is designed to integrate inferred and observed labels, ensuring stable joint supervision throughout training. We evaluate the proposed MCL framework on two large-scale benchmarks—the newly collected Phoenix-building dataset (908.3<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) and the widely used WHU-Aerial dataset. Experiments show that MCL effectively alleviates the impact of noisy labels and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art noise-robust methods, demonstrating its strong reliability and scalability for large-scale building extraction. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/leo85-cc/MCL."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) is widely applied to solve combinatorial optimization, notably routing problems. While existing handcrafted-rule-based knowledge transfer operators facilitate inter-task information exchange and overall convergence in EMTO, they face key limitations: (1) reliance on excellent solutions as carriers hinders knowledge transfer between dimensionally heterogeneous tasks; (2) limited rule generalization impedes modeling complex mappings in many-task environments. To address these, this work proposes evolutionary knowledge transfer via graph learning (EKT-GL). Its core module is an online-updated neural network. EKT-GL introduces a model-based knowledge carrier to transfer common knowledge, replacing solution-based carriers. It employs end-to-end learning to seamlessly integrate similarity measurement, knowledge extraction, and transfer, overcoming manual rule limitations and ensuring superior generalization through data-driven training. In comparative experiments, two routing problems are used to construct many-task heterogeneous data sets with different scale (the maximum number of tasks is 100). Experimental results indicate that EKT-GL have competitive performance compared to other five state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tem.2025.3649069",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "To address the limitations of existing buffer monitoring methods, which overlook activity coupling characteristics and suffer from imbalanced monitoring granularity, this paper proposes a two-level buffer monitoring and control method for critical chain projects considering activity overlapping. The method first analyzes the overlapping execution pattern among coupled activities and their impact on project schedules and buffer consumption. It then determines activity rework time and buffer allocation amount based on the Poisson distribution of information exchange, project attribute factors, and an information evolution model. A phase-level buffer monitoring trigger is set to decide whether to refine monitoring granularity to the activity level, and buffer consumption at the activity level is dynamically triggered and monitored in a rolling manner. This forms a dynamic buffer monitoring system that coordinates phase-level and activity-level control. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms classic approaches across project sizes, reducing project duration by up to 33.28%, project cost by up to 22.71%, and schedule overrun proportion by up to 34.94% under increasing uncertainty. While higher uncertainty slightly decreases the monitoring efficiency of the proposed method, it consistently remains above 0.70, higher than that of the established approaches. By considering overlapping task execution and employing a two-level trigger with rolling updates, the method effectively avoids lagging or excessive buffer warnings, achieving more efficient buffer management."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models enable high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, fine-tuning these pre-trained models for personalization raises concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To address this issue, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has recently been proposed, which embeds watermarks into fine-tuning datasets via backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain dormant on benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite its promise, the robustness of DOV against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how adversaries can circumvent these mechanisms, enabling models trained on watermarked datasets to bypass ownership verification. We begin by analyzing the limitations of potential attacks achieved by backdoor removal, including TPD and T2IShield. In practice, TPD suffers from inconsistent effectiveness due to randomness, while T2IShield fails when watermarks are embedded as local image patches. To this end, we introduce CEAT2I, the first CEA specifically targeting DOV in T2I diffusion models. CEAT2I consists of three stages: (1) motivated by the observation that T2I models converge faster on watermarked samples with respect to intermediate features rather than training loss, we reliably detect watermarked samples; (2) we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected samples and monitor feature shifts to identify trigger tokens; and (3) we apply a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEAT2I effectively evades state-of-the-art DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/csyufei/CEAT2I."

    "abstract": "Grid-forming (GFM) converters are required to meet multiple operational and control demands in power systems. Under grid fault conditions, maintaining transient synchronization stability (TSS), suppressing fault overcurrent, maximizing fault current support, and preserving voltage source characteristics are all of critical importance. However, achieving effective coordination among these objectives remains challenging. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a systematic fault ride-through control strategy capable of rapid current limiting while ensuring the existence of a stable equilibrium point (SEP). Specifically, a novel concept of the GFM operational region is introduced, where the existence of the SEP is rigorously determined via a geometric interpretation, providing a solid stability foundation for the control design. Subsequently, a two-stage virtual admittance (VA) control strategy with accurate current-limiting capability is developed. This strategy employs a predominantly inductive steady-state VA for precise fault current regulation, while incorporating a transient virtual resistance to increase the resistive component of the transient VA, thereby dynamically suppressing current surges. Compared to conventional fixed virtual impedance methods, this approach achieves a balance between steady-state accuracy and transient suppression performance. Furthermore, a coordinated active and reactive power reference strategy is proposed to enhance TSS and ensure maximum fault current injection. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed control strategy exhibits superior comprehensive performance in maintaining system stability, achieving fast current limiting, and providing enhanced fault current support, validating its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Frequency Agile (FA) radar achieves superior antijamming capabilities by modulating the carrier frequency across different pulses. However, the array manifold changes with the carrier frequencies of different pulses, making it challenging to utilize multi-frequency information for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation effectively. This paper presents a DOA estimation method for FA radar in both random frequency mode and adaptive mode. Initially, in random frequency mode, the algorithm runs at the receiver while the transmitter’s carrier frequency varies randomly. A dictionary matrix that integrates multi-carrier frequency information is developed to estimate the DOA of multiple targets using Sparse Recovery (SR) theory. Subsequently, the theoretical performance bounds for DOA estimation in the random frequency mode are analytically derived. Utilizing the pre-estimated DOA results obtained from the random frequency mode, the adaptive mode jointly optimizes both carrier frequency and dictionary matrix to lower theoretical performance bounds, thereby improving the accuracy and resolution of multi-target DOA estimation. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing significant improvements in DOA estimation performance compared to traditional methods."

To achieve these objectives, the MPC incorporates the dynamics of the LCL filter, improving the system’s prediction accuracy. The MPC problem is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) task solved using the OSQP solver for computational efficiency. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed primary control approach, demonstrating its practical feasibility and robust performance."

In such networks, accurate detection of the source modulation scheme is critical for reliable data detection at the destination. The proposed method jointly exploits the temporal delay diversity inherent in DF-FD architectures and feedback from the data decoding process to refine recognition decisions while maintaining manageable complexity. An iterative expectation–maximization procedure is designed for the maximum-likelihood estimate of the modulation format, with the additional capability of estimating timing information and frequency-selective channel parameters. Simulated evaluations under various OFDM scenarios verify the steady superiority of the proposed solution over conventional techniques."

    "abstract": "Real-world gait speed assessment, has recently gained recognition as an important health indicator particularly in patients with chronic conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This study proposes an AI-based method for estimating gait speed in the real-world context in COPD patients using different combinations of three wearable devices: a smartphone, a smartwatch, and a pair of sensorized shoes. An analysis pipeline is developed and trained using laboratory datasets, then validated on an independent dataset acquired under free-walking conditions, demonstrating strong performance in both walking detection and gait speed estimation with mean accuracies across different device combinations of 0.81, 0.93, and 0.90 for resting, walking, and stair climbing activities, respectively, as well as a mean RMSE of 0.118 m/s and an ICC of 0.80. The estimated speed, obtained by applying the developed pipeline to daily life data of COPD patients, showed a strong and significant correlation with the clinical standard of functional capacity, the six-minutes walking distance (6MWD) across 34 patients (Spearman coefficient = 0.854, p-value = 1.38e-10). These findings highlight the feasibility of unobtrusive, continuous gait speed monitoring in real-life conditions, offering a promising integrative tool to traditional clinical assessments. The results suggest that wearable-based mobility monitoring could enhance remote patient management and personalized care strategies for COPD and other chronic conditions."

    "abstract": "Function name inference in stripped binaries is a crucial task that supports various security applications, including vulnerability detection and malware analysis. Existing methods suffer from limited model capacity and insufficient exploitation of function semantics, which constrains their ability to comprehend binary code and leads to poor generalization on unseen binaries. To address these problems, we propose BinLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to exploit the semantic potential of binary code, thereby enhancing function name inference. Specially, BinLLM integrates three key innovations: (1) source code semantics-guided function name refinement, which mitigates the negative effects of low-quality semantic identifiers during training; (2) A context-aware data collection algorithm that seeks richer semantic dependencies to improve model training and inference performance; (3) parameter-efficient fine-tuning on a domain-specific dataset enriched with semantic knowledge to enhance the model's understanding of binary semantics. These components collectively enhance the model's performance in function name inference on unseen binaries. We evaluate BinLLM on a large-scale dataset comprising <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2,864,719$</tex> functions across four architectures (x86-64, x86-32, ARM, MIPS) and four optimization levels (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{O} 0-\\mathrm{O} 3$</tex>). Experimental results show that BinLLM achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with relative gains of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$320.1 \\%, 274.8 \\%$</tex>, and 297.6 % in precision, recall, and F1-score.

To ensure a fair comparison, we control for both the number of parameters and the size of the training samples. Specifically, we focus on the functions with jump discontinuities or with coherent oscillations, and analyze the results through the perspective of spectral bias. Our experimental results suggest that the performance of KANs depends heavily on whether the high-frequency components originate from the underlying signal. Furthermore, even when KANs outperform MLPs in quantitative metrics, their behavior can still exhibit undesirable artifacts. For instance, when dealing with functions with jump discontinuities, KANs show Gibbs-like oscillations near the discontinuity. We hope these experiments offer valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigation into overcoming these challenges."

    "abstract": "Flux Switching Permanent Magnet Machines (FSPM) and Wound-Field Flux Switching Machines (WF-FSM) hold a critical role in modern electric machine technology. FSPM motors are widely employed in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and highperformance industrial systems due to their high-power density, compact design, and superior efficiency. In contrast, WoundField Flux Switching Machines, with their wound-field rotor structure, provide more precise and flexible torque control, offering low torque ripple, high average torque, and reduced harmonic content, which make them particularly advantageous for applications requiring accurate and stable operation. In this study, the Flux Switching Permanent Magnet Machine was first designed, and using the same design parameters, a WoundField Flux Switching Machine motor was subsequently developed. A parametric analysis was performed in Ansys Maxwell to identify the optimal Direct Current (DC) supply current for the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine, which was determined to be 17 A. Based on this current, torque and back electromotive force (back EMF) waveforms as well as magnetic flux distribution visualizations were obtained for the WoundField Flux Switching Machine. These results were then employed to perform a comparative evaluation of the performance characteristics of both motors. The analysis revealed that the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine exhibited a more stable operational profile with low torque ripple and high average torque, whereas the FSPM motor showed more pronounced torque fluctuations and higher harmonic content in its back EMF. Additionally, the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine demonstrated superior performance in terms of vibration and mechanical stress. The findings of this study indicate that the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine is a more suitable choice for applications requiring precise and stable motor control, providing valuable insights for motor design optimization and system integration decisions."

However, existing research lacks a structured understanding of how AI systems support analyst CSA across different decision-making modes. This paper presents a systematisation of knowledge (SoK) that examines how AI-enabled tools contribute to the three levels of CSA: perception, comprehension and projection, across three decision-making modes: automated, augmented, and collaborative. We introduce a three-dimensional framework to assess 73 selected studies, mapping AI support across CSA levels and decision-making modes, specifically for SOC Tier 1 and Tier 2 incident detection and response activities. Our analysis reveals a dominant focus on perception-level support in automated settings, limited attention to higher-level CSA in augmented mode, and no work addressing collaborative decision-making. These findings highlight critical gaps and inform future research directions for designing AI systems that more comprehensively enhance analyst CSA in SOCs."

This research proposes a new framework, NFTraX-ART, that leverages dynamic Non-Fungible Tokens (dNFTs), IoT smart tags, and blockchain to enable live tracking, smooth ownership transfers, and a clear asset history for art. Unlike static NFTs, dNFTs keep changing as metadata that shows where they are now, who owns them, their exhibition history, and their official appraisal information is updated. As for physical artworks, Internet of Things technology with location and movement sensors continuously sends this data to the blockchain to confirm their authenticity and provide clear traceability. Using smart contracts, royalties are automatically applied, all transactions are validated, and alerts are sent when any movements are made outside the programmed areas. Thanks to this mode, the system connects digital and physical worlds, making it safe and straightforward to track essential art pieces. It outlines the important steps for the methodology, the smart contract code, and the simulation process, and checks how the model stacks up against today’s static NFT platforms. According to the results, blockchain systems are more accurate, safer, and track transaction history. Thanks to NFTraX-ART, everyone involved has a secure, up-to-date record of every artwork. Using this approach, NFTs take on an active role in the tracking system, helping change how art is possessed, transferred, and appreciated in the art trading world."

While traditional rigid-link parallel manipulators offer advantages in stiffness and precision, they are often limited by inherent issues such as friction, backlash, and wear associated with conventional kinematic joints. This proposed structure addresses these limitations by leveraging the inherent flexibility and controlled deformation of compliant elements, typically realized through flexure hinges, to achieve three degrees of freedom (e.g., one translational and two rotational motions) without the need for discrete joints. The compliant nature of the tripod facilitates monolithic structure, leading to enhanced repeatability and reduced assembly complexity."

They are especially valuable for validating simulators and calibrating models. Among these metrics, power consumption is critical—particularly for low-power designs—but measuring it accurately outside of simulation environments presents challenges in terms of cost and complexity.To address this, FPGA boards often rely on built-in sensors and monitoring systems. However, such tools are not universally available across all platforms. In this paper, We revisit power measurement using a simple shunt resistor method and demonstrate its effectiveness across FPGA platforms. Using this setup, we analyze how different workloads and memory hierarchies influence both memory and system power. Our study highlights trade-offs often missed in DRAM power models, such as the cache power overhead that can outweigh memory savings, and the shifting efficiency of on-chip memory under contention. Together, these results provide practical guidance for power-aware FPGA evaluation and model calibration."

    "abstract": "Ring topology is a topology design widely used in networks, especially backbone networks. In designing a ring topology, the problem that is solved is how to connect each node to form a ring with the optimum total cost. The optimum weight is the path with the best bandwidth and delay in the topology. To solve these problems can be modeled like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The main goal to be achieved by the TSP algorithm is to find the optimum path with a fast search time. This paper proposes a new heuristic algorithm approach to find the optimum route. The proposed algorithm will be compared with existing TSP algorithms like ant colony optimization (ACO) to validate the results of the proposed algorithm. The brute force algorithm can find the optimum path though it takes a very long time as the number of nodes increases. The ACO algorithm can find the most optimum route faster than the brute force algorithm. Based on the tests, the proposed algorithm can find the most optimal path with a faster time than the ACO algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm can find the optimal route that is better than the ACO algorithm."

    "abstract": "In the coal process, coal-gangue classification is a critical link that directly determines the subsequent processing quality and production efficiency. Statistics show that over $80 \\%$ of global small and medium-sized coal mines still rely on manual visual inspection for this task. However, the high similarity in color, texture, and morphology between coal and gangue results in an average manual misjudgment rate of $15 \\%-20 \\%$, severely hindering the intelligent transformation of the coal mining industry. Thus, developing accurate, real-time automatic classification technology is practically significant for mining intelligent upgrading. Manual classification is susceptible to operators’ subjective experience and on-site lighting variations. Existing YOLO-series models lack adequate ability to capture subtle feature differences between coal and gangue, making it hard to balance real-time performance and accuracy in complex mine environments. In response to these challenges, this work introduces a multi-scale gated attention (MSGA) module into YOLOv8, forming the YOLOv8-MSGA framework, while further employing varied data augmentation strategies and refining the neck fusion mechanism. Using on-site samples, a 4,000-image dataset was formed after augmentation. Tests show the model achieves 96.10% MAP@0.5 and 38.52 FPS, meeting real-time sorting requirements and supporting intelligent mining."

First, MobileViT, which combines the advantages of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) local feature extraction and Transformer global modeling, is used as the backbone network. Subsequently, the network architecture and training strategy are specifically tailored to address the challenges associated with small traffic light targets. Finally, deep compression techniques are applied to ensure compatibility with the computational constraints of vehicle platforms. Experiments show that the recognition accuracy of MobileViT is 92% under normal lighting conditions, 85% under low lighting conditions, and 80% for small target recognition. The real-time reasoning experimental results show that MobileViT achieves an inference speed of 35 FPS with an input of 224x224 pixels, and the amount of calculation (Floating Point Operations, FLOPs) is 0.3B. Compared with other models, MobileViT finds a better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, showing stronger robustness and efficiency, and is suitable for actual vehicle environments."

The three contributors are: the activation overpotential (extra potential required to sustain reactions), the ohmic overpotential (loss in voltage due to resistances between internal components of the cell) and the diffusion potential across the membrane (a component of the membrane potential). We additionally evaluate how diffusion potential across the membrane affects the voltage efficiency of the cell and examine several kilowatt-class batteries to demonstrate the power loss caused by this diffusion potential."

    "abstract": "In the era of Industry 4.0 (4IR), the Internet of Things (IoT) drives the transformation of conventional operation mode into intelligent systems through interconnecting smart devices to monitor, analyze, and optimize the target applications. In order to achieve energy-saving data transmission, a routing protocol, called RPL, has been specified for resource-challenged IoT devices and networks. In the context of 4IR, the IoT technology is being widely used for mission-critical systems, and the data collected by IoT devices might contain privacy-sensitive information. In addition, the IoT gateway could be compromised due to the lack of necessary and persistent physical and/or logical security protection. Hence, the protection of data security and privacy becomes a crucial factor for RPL-based IoT systems to realize their quality of service requirements and objectives successfully. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation approach, called SPARDA, for IoT devices and networks running the RPL routing protocol. SPARDA is realized with physical unclonable function, homomorphic encryption, and trapdoor function, and is perfectly integrated with the RPL routing protocol to prevent the malicious IoT gateway from either accessing, falsificating, or corrupting the real-time data from IoT devices throughout the data gathering and summarization phase. We choose an automatic security protocol verification tool, widely known as AVISPA, to analyze and verify the security specification of SPARDA. We also conduct an experimental study to evaluate the performance of SPARDA by comparing with benchmark methods. The experimental results indicate that not only does SPARDA protect IoT networks from malicious gateway attacks, but it also outperforms existing schemes in terms of computation and storage overheads while satisfying all critical security and privacy criteria."

The current paper proposed a measurement system for a gasoline engine pollution detection during the remap process. The nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide and the hydrocarbons levels are monitored and also the particulate matters (PM) according to the Euro 7 standard requirements. The external temperature and pressure are measured and compared with the gas exhaust temperature and relative humidity to clarify all combustion processes.

    "abstract": "Multi-modality SS-OCTA (Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography), which combines structural B-scan and vascular Angio-flow data, has been shown to be an effective modality to predict Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) diseases outcomes. However, there is a paucity of research in leveraging complementary information via multimodality fusion of SS-OCTA, where conventional fusion strategies are limited in their ability to extract RVO prognosisrelated features. We identified three key challenges with existing methods: (1) the dominance of information-rich modalities (e.g., B-scan) over other modalities (e.g., Angio-flow); (2) static weighting in multi-modality fusion which causes sub-optimal of fusion at inference stage; and (3) the failure of 2D models to capture 3D spatial contextual information from volumetric imaging data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D multi-modality Dynamic Fusion ConvNeXt (mmDFC) framework. Our mmDFC introduces three contributions: (1) a decoupled training approach with ConvNeXt encoders to mitigate modality dominance by preserving specified gradient information for each input source; (2) an uncertainty-aware dynamic fusion mechanism to optimally balance the weights of different modalities; (3) a 3D ConvNeXt architecture to effectively learn the spatial context from SS-OCTA slices. Our framework achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$75 \\%$</tex> and an AUC of 71.3% for NPA prediction on clinical 3D SS-OCTA RVO dataset. Notably, our 3D approach yielded a 6.2% AUC improvement over an analogous 2D framework, demonstrating the value of volumetric spatial context. Our 3D mmDFC sets a new benchmark for SS-OCTA image analysis, providing a robust approach to prognostic assessment in RVO."

    "abstract": "The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) are satellite instruments designed to monitor atmospheric composition, primarily ozone. OMPS onboard SNPP/NOAA-20/NOAA-21 satellites are polar orbiting instruments, providing global coverage once a day. However, GEMS, onboard South Korea's GEO-KOMPSAT-2B satellite, is a geostationary satellite instrument providing more frequent observations over East Asia and adjacent areas. This difference in their orbits defines their unique capabilities and limitations, making intercomparison an essential exercise for harmonizing their datasets and validating their respective ozone retrievals. OMPS provides global coverage, delivering ozone profiles and trace gases with a lower temporal resolution but comprehensive spatial coverage. GEMS complements this by offering high temporal resolution data, allowing the monitoring of diurnal variations in ozone. The intercomparison between OMPS and GEMS helps to evaluate radiometric calibration consistency of measurements. This study focuses on quantifying the radiometric consistency between NOAA-21 OMPS Nadir Mapper (NM) radiance and reflectance measurements with GEMS. One of the benefits of GEO-LEO intercomparison is the satellites have nearly frequent simultaneous overlapping observations. The sensor intercomparison is performed near nadir for OMPS and GEMS, less than 8° view zenith angle. The radiometric bias results provide a good understanding of how well NOAA-21 OMPS agree with GEMS. The results could help to provide independent validation of OMPS data quality. The study could be further expanded to perform intercomparison of GEMS with SNPP and NOAA-20, resulting in opportunities to evaluate the OMPS radiometric consistency through double difference. This could help to further confirm the SNPP, NOAA-20 and, NOAA-21 OMPS radiometric agreements from the past studies performed using 32-day global average and using deep convective clouds. The results presented in this study are valuable for user communities to better understand how well the OMPS and GEMS agree with each other."

Traditional classroom behavior analysis often relies on manual observation, which is subjective, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale, thereby limiting its ability to provide timely and accurate feedback for instructional improvement. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved multi-view Transformer framework for classroom dynamics perception and precise teaching intervention. The framework integrates cross-view geo-alignment with attention fusion to ensure semantic consistency across multiple camera views, introduces role-aware hierarchical queries to highlight teacher-student interactions, and employs decision-guided multitask learning to align recognition outcomes with practical intervention needs. Experiments conducted on real multi-view classroom videos demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in behavior classification, temporal modeling, and intervention ranking compared with existing baselines. This work not only contributes to advancing intelligent education analytics but also provides methodological support for achieving SDGs in promoting equitable, inclusive, and highquality education."

    "abstract": "Gain control in modern Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA) designs is typically achieved through load resistor-based or current Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)-based techniques, each offering distinct advantages and trade-offs. While resistor-based methods provide simplicity, they often degrade bandwidth. Current DAC-based approaches offer finer control and faster switching but suffer from linearity issues at low current levels and require significant silicon area. These limitations pose challenges in advanced Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) systems where area efficiency and high-speed performance are critical.To address these constraints, a new gain control technique is proposed that utilizes a controllable resistor circuit placed between the differential output nodes of the VGA. This output-stage configuration minimizes interference with the signal path and biasing circuitry, enabling effective gain reduction without compromising linearity. The design employs NMOS transistors as programmable resistive elements, controlled via a 3-bit thermometric scheme, offering discrete gain steps with minimal area and power overhead. Although the method supports only unidirectional gain control, it remains highly suitable for high-speed SERDES applications. Initial gain can be set using conventional techniques, with this approach providing fine-tuning capabilities. Despite a slight increase in output capacitance, the overall impact on performance is negligible, making this solution a compact, power-efficient alternative for advanced Analog Front-End AFE designs."

Current robots that do these jobs require humans to wear a glove with numerous piezoelectric sensors within them. Failure of these sensors could lead to the robot arm not following the instruction correctly. In this research a robot is designed and built to the gestures of a human hand moving in front of a laptop camera. The motors that are actuated are placed away from the arm that does the work and elastic strings are used to transmit the actuation of the servo motors to move the fingers of the robot arm. This way the motors will not get contaminated by the hazardous material and can be more easily maintained. Two software were used, one to capture the hand movement and convert it to binary data and the second to operate the motors."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a benchmark framework for structural analysis of floating photovoltaic (PV) systems, adapted from the five-pillar architecture of the Cirata deployment. Rather than evaluating performance metrics, the framework assesses modularity, interoperability, and governance reproducibility across technical, institutional, regulatory, social, and digital dimensions. Three candidate projects—Cirata (Indonesia), Hapcheon (South Korea), and O'MEGA1 (France)—were selected using documented criteria for structural alignment across all five pillars. Cirata serves as the reference architecture; Hapcheon reflects government-led inland deployment, while O'MEGA1 illustrates private-sector innovation in marine conditions. Selection criteria and comparative attributes were systematically documented, forming the analytical base for cross-case synthesis. Findings show notable differences in interoperability and governance resilience, influenced by institutional coordination and regulatory embedding. The proposed framework offers a replicable model for evaluating floating PV systems, emphasizing reproducibility in multi-actor energy governance."

Regularization is a way to increase the adequacy of models by increasing resistance to input data errors. This paper shows how this approach is used for solution of linear equation systems and mathematical models parameters identification, both linear in parameters, using pseudo-inversion of matrices, and nonlinear ones. A connection with the methods of ridge and LASSO regression is noted. The paper considers the ways to generalize regularization by using different norms, weight matrices and combination of norms. A generalization of the regularization approach to solve mathematical remodeling problems is proposed, an approach that is constructed to transform models of one class into another for some benefit. The approach leads to decrease complexity of models, but lose some accuracy."

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for explainable and interpretable model predictions in high-stake decision-making machine learning applications to ensure transparency, trust, and accountability. The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers explainability by linking predictions to input features. However, the current TM lacks a systematic feature ranking mechanism. Feature ranking can inherently lead to the pruning of less important features, making TM more efficient in terms of memory and inference. This paper proposes a feature ranking algorithm that leverages all trained clauses. The algorithm computes the frequency of true and false literals across all clauses to assign importance scores to the features. Once the feature ranking is finalized, the less important features are discarded, and a pruned TM is initialized, trained, and used for the prediction. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of the SHAPbased feature ranking method. The algorithm was evaluated on multiple datasets and cross-validated with tree-based SHAP ranking. The results show that the proposed clause-driven feature importance method yields feature rankings comparable to SHAP while maintaining competitive accuracy with respect to other machine learning models."

This study utilizes OpenSim to analyze joint kinematics in healthy and poststroke participants, validating simulation-generated gait data against an experimental motion capture dataset for accuracy and reliability. This study focused on elderly individuals aged 70-75 years from an existing dataset. To examine gait deviations due to stroke-related impairments, Group A included 9 healthy subjects, while Group B comprised 11 post-stroke individuals. Results indicate that OpenSim underestimates knee and ankle flexion, leading to discrepancies in range of motion (ROM) and root mean square deviation (RMSD). A two-sample Student’s t-test confirms significant hip joint deviations in post-stroke gait while Spearman’s correlation coefficient test shows a high correspondence in trend between OpenSim and experimental results, particularly the hip joint. These findings support the refinement of biomechanical simulations for stroke rehabilitation and clinical gait analysis."

Our framework first decouples the distillation and classification tasks via lightweight projectors to shield the student's backbone. It then uses a cross-level attention mechanism to embed the teacher's high-level semantics into student features. Finally, a novel Frequency-domain Knowledge Revealing (FKR) module with a learnable filter extracts these embedded, high-frequency details characteristic of the teacher's knowledge. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrate that StegaKD consistently outperforms various baseline, validating the efficacy of our information hiding approach."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), their advantages in context analysis and semantic inferencing are becoming increasingly prominent, and we are attempting to introduce them into the realm of DNS repair. As is well known, DNS, as the core of Internet infrastructure, has complex policies and a fragile system, where even a small misconfiguration can lead to catastrophic service failures. Especially in large-scale networks, analyzing detected errors and generating repair solutions often requires operators to invest a significant amount of time and effort. This paper proposes a scalable framework, DNSHolmes, designed to leverage LLMs for generating DNS configuration repair solutions. Specifically, this method first addresses the numerous potential root causes in large-scale errors by abstracting them into a small number of State Equivalence Classes (SECs). It then adopts a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to compute a Critical Path Graph (CPG) for each class, precisely isolating the minimal set of records responsible for the failure. Crucially, the CPG serves as a focused, verifiable context for a Large Language Model (LLM), guiding it to generate accurate patches while overcoming the fundamental context-length limitations that help LLM with effective repair reasoning. Our evaluation on large-scale public datasets and a real-world campus network demonstrates that DNSHolmes can reduce operational effort by 78.4% and achieve efficient repair in large-scale DNS configuration."

    "abstract": "Efficient multiplier design is critical for DSP, cryptography, and high-performance computing. The Karatsuba multiplication algorithm reduces computation but is significantly reliant on the adder used for partial product accumulation. The Brent-Kung adder, which has an area of $408 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} 2$, a power consumption of $45.78 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$, and a timing slack of 1 ns, is the most efficient option for this design, based on a comparative analysis of adders, including the Brent-Kung, Carry Select, and Ripple Carry Adders. This paper introduces a 32-bit Karatsuba multiplier based on a Brent-Kung (BK) adder that is optimised for power, area, and performance. In addition, scan flip-flops are used to improve testing and reliability throughout manufacturing testing. The Karatsuba algorithm is designed and implemented with the Brent-Kung adder’s parallel prefix structure, which reduces carry propagation time and increases total computational performance. Cadence EDA tools were used to implement the RTL to GDSII pipeline. The Brent-Kung adderbased design resulted in a 27.8% reduction in area compared to the conventional design employing square root carry select adder. The existing design has a slack of 0.068 ns, indicating improved timing closure. Post-layout simulations show that the BrentKung adder-based Karatsuba multiplier outperforms traditional architectures, making it an excellent choice for high-performance, energy-efficient computing applications."

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in qualitative settings, their use as autonomous moderators has been proposed, though little is known about their performance in emotionally charged contexts. This study aimed to evaluate ModiBot, a customizable LLM-based focus group moderator, under simulated challenging scenarios. Using a Discord-based platform, four focus groups were conducted with role-playing researchers to simulate dynamics such as constructive discussion, anger, peer conflict, and moderator-directed protest. ModiBot guided participants through structured phases including onboarding, discussion, AI-mediated synthesis, and reflective validation. Quantitative evaluations and qualitative sentiment and thematic analyses revealed that ModiBot was perceived as objective and able to ensure anonymity and structure, but struggled to de-escalate emotional conflict, adapt to complex group behaviors, and manage conversation pacing. The emotional flatness and rigid message flow led to reduced empathy and cohesion. While the tool successfully facilitated data collection, its social intelligence was limited in group contexts. Further interdisciplinary development is needed to enhance emotional responsiveness and adaptability in LLM moderators for sensitive or volatile research environments."

    "abstract": "Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset—a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model’s generalization in the tree-ring detection task."

The system collects vibration signals from small machines such as DC motors, fans, and white goods, and processes them using lightweight signal analysis and dedicated algorithms. Both classical features, such as RMS and FFT, and advanced methods, are candidates to capture time-and frequency-domain fault signatures. In the current phase, the framework and data acquisition components have been implemented on the Raspberry Pi with the AI HAT+. Python modules from a previous research have been ported for on-device signal processing. This implementation lays the groundwork for deploying lightweight neural networks using TensorFlow Lite to enable on-device fault classification."

    "abstract": "When an urban rail vehicle moves, its receptor obtains the current from the contact rail (CR) through the sliding friction. Thus, the receptor could be subject to localized overheating, which causes increased wear and even damage. Based on the dynamic equilibrium equations of the heat transfer and dissipation between the receptor and the CR (referred to as the boot and rail, BAR), and the dynamic electric contact theory, a three-dimensional thermal field model for the BAR system during the vehicle motion is established. The effects of the current, contact force, and motion speed on the temperature rise of the BAR are discussed. The results show that the current is the main factor affecting the temperature rise of the BAR, which exhibits a positive correlation. The temperature decreases with the increase of the contact force. Especially the temperature rise decreases the fastest when the contact force varies from 100 to 120 N, 2.86 times that when it varies from 80 to 100 N, 9.1 times that when it varies from 120 to 140 N. Also the temperature increases with the speed. And the temperature difference from 80 to 100 km/h is 1.5 times that from 60 to 80 km/h. The innovation of this paper lies in comprehensively deriving the formula for the total dynamic contact heat source power based on electrical contact theory and friction theory. A new three-dimensional dynamic thermal field finite element model for the BAR is established. And the trail effect near the electrical contact zone (ECZ) of the CR is researched. The contribution is that the research results are of the reference for the local thermal protection of the receptor and its structural optimization."

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) has become a key technique for enhancing wireless devices in terms of computation performance by enabling task offloading to proximate edge servers. However, the performance of MEC networks is often limited by unfavorable wireless propagation conditions, which degrade the reliability of communication links required for efficient task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have recently been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate these challenges by intelligently reconfiguring the wireless environment through passive beamforming, where the phase shifts of reflecting elements are adjusted to reshape the propagation channel. Nevertheless, single-RIS deployments generally provide limited signal coverage, which is insufficient to support spatially distributed users. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores a MEC framework supported by multiple RISs, where several surfaces are strategically placed to jointly improve network connectivity and computational efficiency. A joint optimization framework is established to enhance the system-wide computation efficiency by simultaneously optimizing user-RIS association, RIS passive beamforming, and the allocation of communication and computation resources. To tackle this highly non-convex problem, we propose an efficient hierarchical optimization framework, termed hierarchical computational efficiency resource allocation (H-CERA). This framework adopts an outer-loop algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method to transform the original sum-of-ratios objective into a tractable form, and an inner-loop alternating optimization procedure to iteratively update the decoupled variable blocks. Comprehensive simulation experiments confirm that the proposed H-CERA framework is effective, showing substantial improvements in computational efficiency over representative baseline schemes. The results further demonstrate its robustness and scalability under diverse system configurations."

    "abstract": "Cooperative-integrated sensing and communication (C-ISAC) networks have emerged as promising solutions for communication and target sensing. However, imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation and time synchronization (TS) errors degrade performance, affecting communication and sensing accuracy. This paper addresses these challenges by employing movable antennas (MAs) to enhance C-ISAC robustness. We analyze the impact of CSI errors on achievable rates and introduce a hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) to evaluate the effect of TS errors on target localization accuracy. Based on these models, we derive the worst-case achievable rate and sensing precision under such errors. We optimize cooperative beamforming, base station (BS) selection factor and MA position to minimize power consumption while ensuring accuracy. We then propose a constrained deep reinforcement learning (C-DRL) approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem, using a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with a Wolpertinger architecture for efficient training under complex constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly integrates TS errors and imperfect CSI into a unified MA-aided cooperative ISAC framework, providing a physically consistent model for both communication and sensing under dual uncertainties. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves system robustness against CSI and TS errors, where robustness mean reliable data transmission under poor channel conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of MA technology to reduce power consumption in imperfect CSI and TS environments."

To address this limitation, we propose an asynchronous optimal DoS (AODoS) attacks algorithm specifically designed for energy-constrained adversaries. The algorithm strategically optimizes channel selection to maximize consensus error. To counteract such attacks, secure control strategies integrating event-triggered and self-triggered mechanisms is developed to achieve resilient bipartite consensus of MASs. Theoretical analysis derives sufficient conditions for ensuring consensus convergence under AODoS attacks. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in mitigating high-intensity DoS attacks."

    "abstract": "Owning to its high efficiency characteristic, resonant converter is designed to operate at resonant frequency as a DC transformer (DCX), where the transformer turns ratio is designed based on the nominal input and output bus voltages. However, the limited number of printed circuit board(PCB) layers and turns makes it difficult for planar transformer to achieve non-integer turns ratio. The common solutions include fractional-turn transformer and matrix transformer, but neither method can achieve non-integer turns ratio without increasing the number of turns. This paper proposes a reluctance-controlled arbitrary non-integer turns ratio planar transformer structure. The proposed structure splits the center column of the magnetic core, and primary windings are wound on two columns and connected in series. By adjusting the reluctance ratio of the two columns, the proposed method achieves arbitrary non-integer turns ratio with fewer turns. Finally, a 30 V-12 V 120 W LLC DCX converter is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the traditional solution, winding loss was reduced by 1.164 W under full-load condition, and the peak efficiency and full-load efficiency were increased by 0.43% and 1.08%, respectively."

A unified joint calibration method is also developed to simultaneously optimize geometric, optical, and normal force parameters, significantly simplifying sensor setup and improving measurement accuracy. Experimental validation shows that our sensor, GelSplitter, achieves a 28.2% reduction in surface normal error while producing cleaner reconstructions with fewer artifacts. The integrated renderer synthesizes high-quality tactile images with a PSNR of 30.22 dB, outperforming single-light source methods by 6.33 dB. The effectiveness of the proposed system is further demonstrated in three downstream tactile tasks: pose estimation, fingerprint recognition, and slip detection."

    "abstract": "Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and sub-graph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/primebo1/C-Graph."

Nevertheless, abnormal nodes, which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users’ preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through network knowledge, the method characterizes the users’ preferences and residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p>"

    "abstract": "With external ionospheric corrections, precise point positioning solutions can be augmented with proper constraints, enabling fast convergence and high-precision positioning performance. However, there are two main issues in user algorithms. Firstly, the contribution of the number of applied ionospheric corrections on positioning performance is not clear to users. For instance, in low-cost sensors where computation resources are limited, applying too many corrections (e.g., tens of corrections) from server will possibly cause slow response. Secondly, the determination of constraining strength for corrections from different satellites remains challenging. Therefore, this paper evaluates the effect of the number of ionospheric corrections on positioning errors and convergence time, and proposes an improved tight-constraining algorithm for partial reliable corrections. Static and simulated kinematic positioning results confirm that the more corrections applied, the better the positioning performance. However, the positioning accuracy only has limited improvements when several corrections are already applied, especially in the north direction. The proposed method reduces static positioning root-mean-square errors by 43.4%, 26.9%, and 32.1% in the east, north, and up directions, respectively, compared to solutions without constraint. In simulated kinematic results, the convergence time is further shortened by 7.7%, 4.8%, and 2.5% for the east, north, and up directions, respectively, compared to cases where all corrections are applied."

    "abstract": "Falcon is a lattice-based post-quantum digital-signature scheme standardized by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As for its hardware implementation, signature verification is the critical operation, in which the polynomial multiplier and the hash generator are computationally intensive. Existing hardware implementations face an inherent resource–performance tradeoff in the multiplier, and the overall verification latency remains high. In this article, we present an accelerator for Falcon signature verification using area-efficient number-theoretic transform (NTT) architecture with simplified Barrett modular multiplier. The precomputed constant of Barrett modular-multiplication unit is adjusted from 21 845 to 21 840. This modification maintains computation correctness while lowering resource consumption and improving throughput, which serves as an efficient building block for NTT/inverse NTT (INTT) operations. Moreover, a fully pipelined, nonstored radix-2 multipath delay commutator (R2-MDC) architecture is adopted for the NTT/INTT, which effectively reduces the delay and achieves a more balanced resource–performance tradeoff. Both the polynomial multiplier and the hash generator are parallelized to improve performance. A complete Falcon-1024 signature verification accelerator is implemented on FPGA platform. Experimental results show that, for the two-stage NTT inside the multiplier, the proposed design attains the lowest area–time product (ATP) compared to state-of-the-art designs, and the ATP of the entire Falcon-1024 verification procedure is reduced by 50%."

    "abstract": "Incomplete multimodal sentiment analysis is to recognize human emotional states by leveraging the incomplete multimodal information including text, audio, and visual data. Existing methods mainly focus on reconstructing from available modalities, while ignoring the specific information of missing modalities and the inconsistent distribution between original and recovered data. In this work, we propose a novel Prototype-based modality-specific feature Distillation Network called ProDNet, which can recover the specific information of missing modalities with more consistent distributions between original and recovered data. In particular, we design a category-specific prototype for each modality to store the modality-specific information, and reconstruct the missing modality by combining the invariant features from existing modalities with the prototype of the missing modality in a feature self-distillation manner. To obtain favorable invariant features, we design an invariant feature distillation strategy, in which the weight-gating mechanism is introduced to enhance invariant feature representation. Finally, to reduce distributional inconsistency, we design a distribution consistency distillation loss to enforce the consistent distribution of original and recovered data by considering the sample correlation between teacher and student networks. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, particularly in scenarios with higher missing rates."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies."

    "abstract": "Despite notable advancements in applying epidemic models to cybersecurity, current approaches often underperform in practice. Research indicates that these models can produce substantial prediction errors due to challenges in parameter estimation, the complexity and heterogeneity of real-world networks, and limitations in accurately evaluating model performance against empirical data. Prior models frequently rely on generalized or static parameters, which can further exacerbate prediction inaccuracies, particularly when estimating infection spread in complex and heterogeneous network environments. Such inaccuracies limit their ability to support timely and effective threat response. To address this gap, this article presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates attack graphs with epidemic modeling. Attack graphs provide a structured representation of potential attack paths and interdependencies within a network, enabling the incorporation of real, context-aware values into the epidemic model. This integration enhances parameter accuracy and improves predictive capability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework (PFW) achieves a 91.25% improvement in performance. More specifically, the results indicate that the average number of infected devices using the proposed method with an attack graph for multivulnerabilities is 5, while for single-vulnerability cases it is 18. In comparison, traditional epidemic models without attack graph integration result in an average of 70 infected devices. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing infection spread under diverse vulnerability conditions. Overall, the results demonstrate the value of grounding epidemic models in realistic network conditions, thereby advancing adaptive threat modeling, proactive defense strategies, and informed decision-making. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and real-world application, offering a significant step toward practical epidemic-based approaches in cybersecurity."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Face expression recognition (FER) has been extensively explored by the research community, with comparisons between different FER models typically relying on accuracy metrics. To make model decisions more interpretable, evaluation can be complemented with the usage of (model-agnostic) explainability tools, leading to explainable FER models (XFER). However, the effectiveness of explainability tools in the context of XFER is seldom evaluated. This paper proposes a framework, entitled \"face expression recognition explainability evaluation framework, based on action units\" (XFER-AU), for evaluating the quality of explanations provided by different explainability tools in the context of XFER. To establish a comparison term, XFER-AU automatically generates a FER explanation ground truth, based on facial action units (AU). The proposed framework thus enables the comparison of explainability tools in terms of their ability to explain the decision made by an FER model. To perform the comparison, an evaluation metric called weighted explainability score (WES) is proposed, which takes into account the number of ground truth AUs covered and the precision of the explainability map produced. The proposed framework is used to compare several explainability tools, notably Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME), Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), Average Removal/ Aggregation (AVG), Minus and PLUS explanation (MinPLUS) and Randomised Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE). The proposed XFER-AU results report that, for the tested datasets, LIME explanations tend to better align with the ground truth. In more challenging scenarios, the FER models struggle to effectively point to the facial AUs relevant to explaining the observed expression, thereby reducing the model’s decision confidence. Results also show that even when an expression is correctly classified, older FER models, such as those based on VGG-16, support their decision on a smaller number of the relevant AUs when compared to more recent models, such as EfficientNet-B0."

Accurately predicting future extreme heat year (hereinafter referred to as extreme heat) is crucial for ecological protection, energy management, and infrastructure planning. Using historical temperature data, this study defines extreme heat via the quantile method, ensuring regional representativeness. To address the limitations of traditional forecasting methods in predicting extreme heat characterized by “small sample sizes and complex influencing factors,” we have proposed a new grey disaster prediction model. The new model introduces a three-element adjacent mean generation operator and uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for global optimization of its key parameters. Applying this model to Chongqing, China’s 1951–2024 extreme heat, we predict the next three occurrences will be in 2026, 2029, and 2031. This model offers a new approach to extreme heat prediction and supports urban heatwave emergency response optimization, aiding high-temperature disaster prevention and sustainable ecological development."

A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A $^{*}$ search over a terrainaware configuration space. Comprehensive experiments on multiple terrain datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines."

We propose a Cross-seasonal Common-master (CSCM) Interferograms Subsets method to accurately estimate the tropospheric delays of master and slave images. Firstly, the characteristic of the tropospheric delays being strong in summer and weak in winter is used to generate the cross-seasonal common-master interferograms subsets. Then, the tropospheric delays are estimated by modeling each subset. We validate the Sentinel-1A/B atmospheric delays correction in Sydney. The results show the RMSE between the InSAR deformation with atmospheric correction by our method and the GPS measurements is 7.6 mm, which is 49% lower than that before tropospheric correction, i.e. 14.7 mm. Therefore, the new method provides an accurate and efficient means for the tropospheric delay estimation of Sentinel-1 data, which can be applied to atmospheric water vapor inversion and high precision surface deformation monitoring."

    "abstract": "A distributed machine learning framework allows multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sending data away from the data-generating device. This approach, known as federated learning (FL), involves decentralized clients contributing to build their own local model with a shared global model. However, this framework inevitably generates significant data communication exchanges between clients and the central server, which can produce overhead traffic in the network and potentially degrade quality of service (QoS) and network efficiency. To alleviate this problem, we proposed client selection methods in federated learning, enabling the system to strategically involve only the most suitable clients in each training round. This study proposes a stability-based client selection method, in which clients are evaluated according to the consistency of their local training behaviour, ensuring that only stable participants are prioritized to build an updated global model. The experimental results demonstrate that applying this stability-based client selection method in the FL system achieves an average network efficiency improvement of 46.88%, indicating a substantial reduction in communication overhead and enhancing network quality by addressing potential bottlenecks."

    "abstract": "Recently, machine learning algorithms in computer vision have made significant contributions to the development of computer-assisted systems for the diagnosis and early detection of dangerous skin cancers. In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for classifying dermatologic images used in the diagnosis of skin diseases. Our approach involves three main steps: first, an image preprocessing stage removes artifacts from input data; second, region-of-interest segmentation employs the U-Net architecture; third, classification utilizes an ensemble model that combines the strengths of ResNet convolutional neural networks and the Vision Transformer architecture. Experiments were carried out on the widely recognized HAM10000 dataset. During these experiments, our proposed approach demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.57%, a macro-averaged AUC-ROC score of 1.00, and a micro-averaged F1-score of 0.99. Importantly, it also achieved very high levels of both specificity (98.87%) and sensitivity (93.44%), making it particularly suitable for use in medical diagnostic settings. Visualizations generated by the Grad-CAM technique further confirmed the clinical interpretability of the model's predictions. These findings suggest substantial promise for the application of our approach in developing decision-support systems aimed at improving the diagnosis of skin diseases."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is the main source of income of every country and agriculture plays a critical role in sustaining human civilization by providing food, fuel, and other essential resources. Even though, the conflict between farmers and wildlife remains a significant challenge even today. It is essential to arrange the protection of fields and farms by deterring wild animals and predators without making harm to the wildlife. This study proposes a framework that can detect and classify animals or intruders or any natural calamities. The novelty of the study is deterring the wild animals using innocuous devices and chemical components instead of the harmful electric fences and other methods. Based on the classification it will take preventive measures and will send an alert to the Farmer. The preventive measures are ensuring that will not make any harm to the wild animals. The framework incorporated four major components PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensor, Raspberry Pi Camera, Scarecrow and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) Module. PIR Sensor detects an object, Raspberry Pi Camera captures the images and images classify the specific object, later based on the type of the animal the scare tactics will be applied by the scarecrow and if any unusual incident is happening like the presence of an intruder, fire or tornado the alert will send to the Farmer with the help of a GSM Module."

The primary challenge with many network design issues is that cost and inherent technical limitations limit the maximum node degree. In this work, we used the optimum flow approach, utilizing traffic and distance data to simulate the best interconnection planning for a section of Sumatra's island divided into multiple clusters. With the use of our suggested system, we developed an optimum flow algorithm for the Sumatra region that can automatically select the best interconnection, resulting in the optimal interconnection in each cluster."

    "abstract": "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSSR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is widely used in target detection. However, its low signal power and narrow bandwidth directly lead to low radar imaging resolution and significant noise impact. Because of the low resolution of GNSS-R SAR, high sampling rate is required during sampling. This leads to the large size of the imaging matrix, which affects the imaging speed. And low rank leads to the ill-posedness of its observation matrix. Therefore, in order to improve its imaging speed and alleviate its ill-posedness, we propose a fast range super-resolution imaging based on TSVD dimensionality reduction combined with FISTA. In the proposed method, the matrix dimension reduction is carried out to reduce the amount of data processing and accelerate the speed of the algorithm. Since the TSVD technique alleviates the ill-posedness of the measurement matrix, the L1 norm constraint is introduced to construct the objective function by using the sparse characteristics of the target from the regularization. Finally, the approximate solution is found by solving the objective function with the fast iterative threshold shrinkage method of adaptive step size. The simulation results show that this method not only improves the resolution accuracy of GNSS-R SAR, but also greatly accelerates the speed of the fast iterative threshold shrinkage method."

    "abstract": "The ethological study of cetaceans, such as hump-back whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), plays a vital role in marine conservation efforts. Traditionally, behavioral analyzes have relied on manual video inspection, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. The adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has improved data collection through efficient and noninvasive aerial monitoring. However, this advancement has led to a substantial increase in the volume of video footage, intensifying the burden of manual review. To address this challenge, we propose a computer vision–based solution that integrates deep learning techniques for the automatic detection and tracking of whales on UAV footage. Using the YOLOv8 model for object detection and the DeepSORT algorithm for real-time multi-object tracking, our system successfully identified and followed humpback whales across varied video sequences. Visual evaluation of the results demonstrated consistent detection accuracy, maintaining spatial coherence even under varying lighting conditions and surface disturbances. The system’s ability to capture detailed movement patterns and behavioral sequences suggests strong potential for supporting qualitative behavioral assessments. This approach streamlines data processing and facilitates in-depth observation of whale behavior in natural settings, thereby contributing to improved conservation practices."

    "abstract": "The paper introduces a new Adaptive Decentralised Real-Time Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication Framework designed to enhance the efficiency of collision avoidance in autonomous vehicle (AV) networks. When AVs are found on more roads, fast and dependable communication between the vehicles is vital to avoid accidents and increase traffic safety. The framework introduces edge computing inside the vehicles, enabling them to process the data gathered by several sensors on the spot, thus cutting latency. Thanks to a blockchain-inspired decentralized protocol, all messages are authenticated and remain reliable without requiring central servers, thus increasing security. An AI-based collision forecasting system checks the collected sensor signals to predict collisions fast and take quick preemptive actions. It prioritizes the delivery of important messages and manages the device’s bandwidth by sending the signals only when needed. It also helps by switching available channels cleverly to prevent communication interruptions and overcrowding. Working together, models updates make the network better, and all data is kept confidential during this process. The results of the simulation explain that collision rates, time between messages, and network delays are reduced more than in current V2V systems. This approach makes it easy to avoid collisions in real time and offers good security, which also makes it simple for AVs to communicate with other vehicles on the roads. The suggested method is expected to make roads safer, increase traffic flow smoothness, and speed up the adoption of trustworthy autonomous vehicles."

Through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 77 participants aged 60 and above, we identify key barriers, including cybersecurity knowledge gaps, usability challenges with authentication mechanisms, and a lack of accessible security support. Participants report concerns about online fraud, privacy risks, and the overwhelming nature of security advice, which often results in digital disengagement. By categorizing participants by technology usage–low, medium, and high, we uncover distinct cybersecurity behaviors. Greater technology use is often accompanied by increased awareness of cyber threats; however, this does not necessarily translate into secure practices, as many continue to struggle with two-factor authentication (2FA) and secure password management. Medium-usage participants exhibit high anxiety over scams and rely on family for security support, while low-usage individuals, though less exposed to threats, remain at risk due to a lack of foundational digital skills and reliance on avoidance-based security strategies. Our findings highlight the urgent need for targeted cybersecurity education, simplified authentication systems, and age-appropriate security interventions to enhance digital confidence, cyber resilience, and online inclusion among older adults, ensuring their secure and equitable participation in an increasingly digital society."

It accounts for the input of the generator fuel costs, a quadratic function in $/hr, cost curve analysis, product of input-output hour curve (BTU/hr), and fuel-curve ($/BTU). Cost-curve is often a piecewise continuous function and the derivative of the cost- curve with respect to the power gives the incremental operating cost. Total load of the 5-bus system is 824.5 MW, allowing the generator units to have automatic generation control for optimizing the best economic dispatch. The 5-bus system was verified to study the system stability and minimizing the operating costs of the system. The research rigorously analyzes the allocation of power generation among multiple generating units with the objective of minimizing overall generation cost, while accounting for real system constraints and losses particularly focusing on cost-power study."

    "abstract": "Modern high-speed SerDes and clock/data recovery (CDR) systems heavily rely on phase interpolators (PI) to generate accurate clocks for timing critical paths. As data rates continue to scale, achieving linear code-to-phase transfer becomes increasingly difficult due to device nonidealities, shrinking supply voltages, and tighter jitter budgets. Nonlinearity in the interpolator directly degrades timing accuracy, leading to higher bit-error rates (BER). This work explores methods to improve interpolator linearity in CMOS inverter-based mixer architectures. The three methods are: digital predisposition, an ac-coupled feedback inverter at the input, and reduced supply operation of the mixer stage. Simulation results show that the combination of these methods effectively flattens the code-to-phrase characteristics and reduces integral nonlinearity. Trade-offs are added circuit complexity, area and jitter. The results demonstrate that with modest design, the proposed methods provide a practical way toward more accurate PIs in advanced SerDes and CDR applications."

The results demonstrate that the MLP-LGBM hybrid model performs well in global coastal regions achieving a mean bias (MB) of 0.07°C, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.64°C, and a correlation (R) of 0.998. Using in situ SST Quality Monitor SST as a reference, the model shows significant improvement compared to AMSR2 L2 SST, with an MB of 0.07°C, an RMSE of 0.59°C, the R is 0.998. This study confirms the effectiveness of using machine learning approach to retrieve SST in global coastal regions.

This paper suggests using ChainMedX, which relies on blockchain technology to let patients, doctors, and other healthcare professionals exchange data in real time with dynamic consent consent management. ChainMedX uses permissions, smart contracts, and zero-knowledge proofs to let patients pick who can have access to their medical records, manage exactly what is shared, and specify the time period the sharing is needed, making sure those permissions cannot be altered. Being distributed across both cloud and edge servers, the patient-managed encrypted data vaults make active updates of medical records possible, complying with FHIR standards. Thanks to an AI-based consent suggestion module, patients receive useful advice that suits their needs and the current emergency situation. In addition, ChainMedX deals with urgent issues, such as fast access with easy ‘break-glass’ rules and complete tracking of every transaction, and makes it easier for healthcare services to interact with the wider health organization and verify insurance policies. According to the results, latency, security, and managing consent are all better in the new system than in systems that operate centrally or rely on blockchain. The research mentions that connecting blockchain, edge computing, and privacy-based cryptography can form a healthcare system that respects patient data privacy and makes healthcare cooperation speedy and secure. The goal of this framework is to help provide for data exchange between countries, while including new forms of digital health technology, all this aims to strengthen patient trust and the integrity of their medical data, along with providing better healthcare outcomes."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses methods for improving the accuracy of temperature measurements with thermistor sensors. Thermistors are widely used in various industrial and domestic applications due to their high sensitivity. However, their nonlinear characteristics, hysteresis, and the influence of parasitic factors such as noise and others can lead to significant measurement errors. The article analyzes various calibration methods, the use of precise analog and digital signal processing circuits. A temperature measurement system with a thermistor sensor based on the LabVIEW software product has been developed, on which the methods for reducing the error in temperature measurement are applied. The results show that the application of combined hardware and software corrections can improve the accuracy of measurement with thermistor sensors to a level comparable to that of more expensive temperature measurement sensors."

    "abstract": "The amount of energy used by standard streetlights in cities is a genuine concern, particularly when few cars are on the streets. Each light in these places works at maximum brightness, leading to energy waste and environmental harm. Sustainability in smart cities can be reached when suitable energy-efficient solutions are available for changing traffic demands. A system is discussed in this research that adjusts its light output according to the amount of traffic on the street in real time. The combination of IoT sensors, observing areas such as streets, and a central control system allows traffic conditions to decide the brightness of streetlights. A basic rule is used to control streetlight brightness: they are brightest when there is high traffic, dimmer if traffic is moderate, and either dim or off during low or no traffic. It saves power and guarantees everyone using the streets will feel securely illuminated. A simulation of the proposed system shows that energy usage can be reduced by as much as 70% when most people are not using the system, without endangering the public. If developed, this system is scalable, low in cost, and able to adapt, making it useful for urban regions hoping to save energy and maintain public safety. As a result, this system significantly reduces streetlighting’s effects on the environment and contributes to building more intelligent and greener cities."

To address the limitations of traditional linear models in capturing nonlinear relationships and dynamic behavioral data, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and explainable AI (XAI) techniques (SHAP and LIME) were employed, with data from 153 Chilean engineering students. Results indicate that SVM performs superiorly in small-sample scenarios compared to benchmark models. XAI analysis reveals critical thresholds in key factors, while self-reported and observational information literacy metrics show divergent predictive efficacy across different STEM courses. These findings support the adoption of dual-assessment frameworks and curriculum-specific interventions, highlighting the value of transparent, data-driven decision-making in STEM education."

This paper introduces a comprehensive data-driven framework that integrates multi-source heterogeneous data—including asset registers, historical defect records, dissolved gas analysis (DGA), and, verload histories—to better characterize equipment aging. A systematic preprocessing pipeline is applied to improve data quality, incorporating advanced text normalization for categorical features. Among several state-of-the-art machine learning models evaluated, CatBoost demonstrated superior performance. Its hyperparameters were optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to further improve predictive accuracy and robustness. Validated on a real-world utility dataset, the proposed TPE-CatBoost model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.90 years in RUL prediction, confirming its effectiveness and practical value for proactive transformer asset management."

    "abstract": "The goal of periodic high-utility itemsets mining (PHUIM) is to uncover item combinations with high utility over recurring intervals based on minimum utility constraints. Traditional periodic high utility itemsets mining (PHUIM) algorithms rely on preset thresholds, which are difficult to choose without prior data knowledge. This work presents Top-K periodic high utility itemsets mining (TOPKPHM), a Top-K approach that addresses threshold specification by dynamically maintaining the utility value at the K-th rank position. TOPKPHM employs the Estimated Utility & Support Co-Occurrence Structure (EUSCS) for unified utility and support management. An enhanced utility-list structure integrates periodicity constraints directly, eliminating separate data structure overhead. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show TOPKPHM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving execution time reductions of multiple times compared to traditional methods on the chess dataset while maintaining consistent memory efficiency. This work advances constraint-based pattern mining theory and provides practical solutions for large-scale temporal data analysis."

This is particularly important for validating the effectiveness of design solutions during the construction or renovation of networks and ensuring stable power supply to consumers.

As the part of visual perception pipeline, we perform text detection and recognition where the coordinates of bussinesses were extracted. These extracted coordinates then are used as destination points for path planning algorithms. The experiments were conducted in the Gazebo simulation environment using a TurtleBot3 Waffle robot platform. The performance of path planning algorithms is evaluated based on following metrics; distance to the target, time to reach the destination, energy consumption, CPU load, and RAM usage. The experimental results shows that A* outperforms Dijkstra algorithm in terms of shorter travel time, lower energy consumption and CPU usage."

    "abstract": "Hospital staff scheduling algorithms are difficult to design because of changing demands, employee preferences, and legal restrictions. A potential remedy is offered by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which produce flexible timetables that maximize staff satisfaction and maximize resources because of its adaptability to real world complexities, efficient handling of nonlinear constraints, faster execution, robustness, ability to generate synthetic data based realistic schedule in case of limited historical data and most importantly ability to handle last minute schedule changes dynamically. This study presents a GANbased approach to hospital staff schedule generation that takes into account limitations including role-based requirements, legal compliance, and personal preferences. A generator that suggests schedules and a discriminator that evaluates their viability and quality are both components of the GAN architecture. These schedules are improved by iterative training, increasing their usefulness in practical settings. The GAN is useful in complicated healthcare scheduling situations because it uses previous patient load and staff data to dynamically adapt to hospital demands, improving scheduling accuracy, workload distribution, and response to unforeseen changes."

This paper presents a hybrid mean-max color correction algorithm with contrast enhancement, to enhance the quality of underwater images.

The integration into the grid requires high-quality power conversion and CHB-MLIs are particularly advantageous for this goal because of their modular structure and enhanced output quality. In addition, the employed control strategy in these inverters determines the overall performance and efficiency. This paper investigates a dedicated analysis of a Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) for 7-level grid-connected CHB-MLI. The system, including the inverter and an LCL filter, is modeled in Simulink/MALTAB, and the evaluation of the performance is carried out by measuring the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the injected grid current and assessing its robustness under grid fluctuations. The analysis finds out that FCS-MPC shows a high efficiency, ability to select optimal switching states, integrate multiple control objectives, such as grid current tracking and DC-link voltage balancing, capacity to address system constraints and notable improvements in power quality. The results demonstrate the critical role of advanced control methods to maximize the performance of grid-connected CHB-MLIs in renewable energy systems."

    "abstract": "Deep Learning-based Side-Channel Analysis (DLSCA) has demonstrated its potent attack capability against cryptographic systems, enabling the extraction of secret information from leaked physical signal traces. Unfortunately, the availability of real traces for classifier training is often limited due to restricted data collection or protective countermeasures. The generation and enhancement of signal trace is crucial in practical DL-SCA analysis. Existing methods often struggle to accurately model the feature distribution of real traces, and their applicability to emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose DMSCT, an attention-enhanced diffusion model framework for side-channel trace generation. DM-SCT precisely models the feature distributions of real traces through a conditional injection mechanism and an enhanced attention mechanism. We evaluate DM-SCT across three PQC algorithms: NTRU, Saber, and Kyber, demonstrating its ability to faithfully replicate the leakage features of original side-channel traces. By integrating DM-SCT into DL-SCA, we validate its practical efficacy. Compared to training with real traces alone, DM-SCT improves the accuracy of recovering individual key coefficients by 0.62% to 1.6%. Furthermore, DM-SCT reduces the required number of real training traces by 20% to 25%, outperforming state-of-the-art trace generation methods."

The data was then clustered by distance using Quantile Binning and Fixed Interval methods. Various ensemble models were evaluated across three modeling scenarios: a specific model per cluster, a global model (baseline), and a global model with an added cluster feature. The results consistently demonstrate that the global model (baseline) approach delivered the most accurate and robust performance, with the Stacking model achieving the best results (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.80). The initial hypothesis, which stated that prediction error would increase with distance, was definitively rejected. In-depth analysis revealed that the error peaked at mid-range distances (100-250 meters), attributed to the high volatility of the actual signal in complex local environments like urban canyons. This finding proves that unmodeled local environmental factors have a more dominant influence on prediction difficulty than signal attenuation due to distance alone, offering the insight that more detailed geospatial features are needed to improve model accuracy in the future."

Based on Bloom's Taxonomy and CBE/CBT concepts, we adopted a “4C” teaching philosophy centered on Competency, incorporating Constructivism, Cultivation and Conduction to the teaching reform of core courses in the Air Traffic Management major. Utilizing the independently developed TULIP smart learning platform, which offers multiple categories of learning resources and virtual simulation training tasks, we designed a teaching implementation plan featuring “online task-driven independent learning + offline targeted deepening and expansion”. This model was practiced in courses such as Procedural Control. The results indicate that this mode significantly saves teaching time in classroom while effectively enhancing students' knowledge application ability and practical skills, providing a new referable path for teaching reform in the ATM major."

    "abstract": "Histopathology image registration is a critical process for accurate diagnosis and analysis in medical imaging. Feature-based methods, compared to intensity-based or transform-based techniques, are particularly effective in aligning histopathology images due to their robustness against variations in staining, lighting, and tissue deformation. These methods allow for precise comparison and interpretation of tissue samples, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we employ the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) detector to generate key points and use the BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) algorithm for feature matching. The ORB detector is advantageous due to its computational efficiency and invariance to rotation and scale, making it ideal for histopathological applications. To further enhance performance, adaptive thresholding is incorporated in ORB for improved feature detection in varying intensity regions. Additionally, RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is applied for robust outlier rejection, ensuring accurate alignment of histopathology images. This combination has demonstrated successful results in aligning histopathology images, ensuring high accuracy and consistency. The proposed method effectively addresses challenges posed by variations in tissue appearance, contributing to improved diagnostic precision and research in medical imaging."

    "abstract": "Compared to traditional single-sensor data-based techniques, multi-source data provides complementary information about land cover targets, making it a hot research direction for improving the segmentation performance of land cover. However, multi-source data-based segmentation faces significant challenges due to the domain shifts in heterogeneous data, substantial sensitivity differences, imbalanced class distributions, and the limited availability of well-matched heterogeneous data samples. Therefore, A Prior Feature-injected Cross-Attention auto-Encoder(PF-CAE) is proposed using optical and SAR Images. First, an unsupervised prior feature injection module is designed to reduce the reliance on training data. Specifically, it utilizes maximum-based texture features, and magnitude-based strong scattering features extracted from optical and SAR images, respectively, as prior constraint features, emphasizing the strengths of heterogeneous data in segmenting different land cover types. Second, a transformer-based cross-attention feature module is introduced, which facilitates the extraction and learning of semantically consistent features while suppressing interference from redundant or irrelevant unique features. Finally, a class-weighted cross-entropy loss function is developed to address the imbalanced class distributions. Experimental results on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PF-CAE, achieving an average improvement of 3.5 % in the Kappa compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms."

While many fake voice detectors achieve strong performance in controlled settings, they often overfit to speaker-irrelative features (SiFs), exhibit poor robustness, and fail in multi-speaker scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MultiSiFer, a novel fake voice detector grounded in a new design philosophy: rather than merely distinguishing synthetic from human voices, it explicitly prioritizes learning essential human voice characteristics. MultiSiFer leverages a pre-trained speech representation model to enhance this learning and is the first detector trained on a newly curated multi-speaker fake voice dataset, enabling effective generalization across speakers. Experiments show that MultiSiFer outperforms existing methods in both standard and multi-speaker settings, achieving 10.84% average equal error rate (EER)."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop LLM-driven UAV operation code generation framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into semantic trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM’s understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity."

    "abstract": "Under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm, wireless networks are evolving into multifunctional platforms that seamlessly combine data transmission with high-precision ranging for applications such as indoor navigation, asset tracking, and context-aware Internet of Things (IoT). The Multi-Carrier Phase Difference (MCPD) method has emerged as an effective technique for enabling localization in narrowband communication systems by estimating the channel frequency response (CFR) used for distance estimation. Converting the two-way CFR (TWCFR) into a one-way CFR (OWCFR) provides a physically consistent representation of the propagation channel and thus improves the ranging performance. However, existing channel reconstruction (CR) methods rely on noise-sensitive phase unwrapping which degrades in the presence of noise and interference, common in dense IoT deployments and crowded frequency bands. To address these limitations, we propose a noise-resistant OWCFR reconstruction algorithm that utilizes a peak-driven adaptive windowing strategy to generate a reference TWCFR for reliable square-root branch selection and incorporates a delay alignment correction to restore the maximum unambiguous range. Simulation and experimental results using IEEE 802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) compliant devices demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust and accurate distance estimation in more than 99.8% of interference scenarios."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require high-capacity, low-latency memory systems to process large graphs. A hierarchical hybrid memory architecture combining high-capacity Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and low-latency DRAM offers a promising solution. However, the inherent sparsity of graph data results in poor locality for GNN memory requests, leading to low DRAM cache hit rates and numerous misses, which significantly impairs the hybrid memory system’s performance. A critical issue is that DRAM misses in serial access mode incur substantial latency. While parallel access mode can mitigate this for misses, it introduces long-tail latency and wastes bandwidth for DRAM hits. In this paper, we focus on addressing these issues from two aspects: increasing the cache hit rate and decreasing the miss latency. We mainly propose two predictors: a future data access predictor that enables accurate prefetching to DRAM, thereby improving cache hit rates, and a data location predictor that determines whether data resides in DRAM or NVM, optimizing the choice between serial and parallel access modes to reduce miss latency. By integrating these predictors, we achieve efficient data access in both DRAM and NVM. Our experiments show a 49.5% reduction in memory delay and a 38.1% increase in memory bandwidth utilization compared to baseline."

A gated anode diodes (GAD) configured with a gallium arsenide (GaAs) enhancement-mode pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility-transistor (E-pHEMT) is focused as a rectifier diode. The GaAs E-pHEMT GAD is characterized to formulate its rectification efficiency. In K-band rectification at an input power of 100 mW or less, it is analytically clarified that the 0.18 μm GaAs E-pHEMT GAD, manufactured using a standard GaAs process, exhibited a rectification efficiency within 2% of that of the commercially available GaAs Schottky barrier diode (SBD) (MACOM MA4E1317) widely used in millimeter wave systems. For the K-band 1 W rectifier MMIC demonstrated in this paper, multi-stage series-connected GaAs E-pHEMT GADs with a wider gate width are used to achieve high-power rectification with high efficiency. For the prototyped K-band 1 W rectifier MMIC, the gate width and the stage number of the series-connected GADs are optimized and a rectification efficiency of 64% at 26.5 GHz is achieved. This is the highest value reported for 50 Ω matched watt-class rectifiers. The results confirm that the proposed design approach with the GaAs E-pHEMT GAD is effective for high-power rectification in the K-band."

    "abstract": "The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) paradigm empowers individuals to manage their own credentials by storing them in digital wallets under their full control. In SSI, a credential embeds a list of claims representing personal attributes of the holder, and it is digitally signed by the issuer. When requested, the holder submits some of their credentials to a verifier to prove some of their attributes (e.g., being of legal age). However, to protect their privacy, the holder might want to disclose to the verifier only a subset of the claims embedded in each of the credentials they share, thus requiring a mechanism for hiding the other claims without invalidating the digital signatures of the credentials. This paper surveys the approaches enabling a subject to disclose only selected claims from a signed credential, known as Selective Disclosure. These approaches define the protocol the issuer should follow to construct the credentials, and the holder should follow to disclose only the claims they wish. We examined five approaches, based on: atomic credentials, hashing, encryption, hash trees, and signature, and we compare them from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view. In order to perform an unbiased quantitative evaluation, we developed a reference implementation for each approach and we assessed their performance in executing the same SSI operations on the same credentials. In particular, we measured the time required to create and verify credentials and presentations, as well as the size they take, varying both the number of claims in the credentials and the percentage of disclosed ones in the presentations. The proposed qualitative and experimental comparison is meant to support application designers in understanding which of the available selective disclosure approach is more convenient for their application scenarios."

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. Significance: This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations."

These limitations hinder performance when handling ultra-long vectors or non-uniform workloads, as they require extensive strip-mining and careful low-level tuning to maintain efficiency. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Zoozve</i>, a flexible, strip-mining-free extension to the RISC-V vector ISA. Zoozve introduces an arbitrary register grouping mechanism that enables more precise register utilization and eliminates the need for data slicing across multiple loop iterations. This work presents a full-stack realization of Zoozve, including (1) a hardware-compatible ISA with support for flexible vector lengths and asymmetric instructions, (2) a compiler backend based on LLVM that performs intrinsic splitting, register allocation with live-interval modification, and instruction coalescing, and (3) a hardware proof-of-concept implementation that integrates hazard detection and a register-level element exchange engine. Experimental evaluation using instruction-level simulation shows that Zoozve achieves up to 344.44× speedup in fast Fourier transform (FFT), 76× in dot product, 58.92× in axpy, and 20.41× in 2D convolution compared to RVV, primarily by eliminating strip-mining and improving register reuse. Register transfer level (RTL) synthesis in a 40 nm process shows that Zoozve’s additional hardware logic incurs only 9% area overhead, confirming its feasibility for real-world deployment. Together, these results demonstrate Zoozve’s potential as a scalable and efficient vector processing solution for high-performance computing, machine learning, and signal processing."

Online monitoring of gate oxide degradation significantly enhances device operational reliability. This paper proposes an online method for monitoring gate oxide degradation in SiC MOSFETs using turn-on current rise time. Firstly, the influence of gate oxide degradation on turn-on current rise time is investigated through theoretical modeling. Secondly, the effectiveness of analytical analysis is validated via experiments. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the package degradation does not affect turn-on current rise time. Thirdly, an operational monitor circuit of turn-on current rise time is designed, and the feasibility of this monitoring approach to detect the variation in turn-on current rise time is validated through simulation. This non-invasive method offers strong real-time capability, providing an effective approach for online SiC MOSFETs health assessment and system reliability prediction."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of international aviation has significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions. The existing type of jet fuel consumes a considerable amount of crude oil, which has compounded the demand. As a result, the industry accounts for a carbon footprint that reduces the pressure on alternative energy sources with lower carbon emissions. Agricultural waste comprises straw, husks, and stalks, which denotes one such available lignocellulosic feedstock that is not exhaustively utilised to offer a solution to environmental and economic dilemmas in the aviation energy production. The given research paper proposes an integrated solution to transform agricultural waste materials into high-energy-density biofuels, which can be utilised in the aviation industry through a two-stage biochemical and thermochemical treatment, followed by subsequent fuel upgrading to produce a high-quality product. Pre-treatment options, which were attempted on a lab scale, included steam explosion, dilute acid hydrolysis, enzyme saccharification, fermentation, pyrolysis, and Fischer-Tropsch catalytic upgrading. The parameters of the process conditions were optimised to achieve a high yield and minimise energy consumption. Results were statistically analysed to ensure reproducibility, and fuel properties were compared to ASTM D7566 standards to verify that they conformed to conventional jet fuel specifications. The results show that biofuels produced from agricultural waste have an energy density similar to that of Jet A fuel, with notable reductions in carbon and particulate emissions, making them a viable option for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions caused by aviation. The techno-economic analysis also demonstrates the viability of large-scale implementation, based on the availability of feedstock, process effectiveness, and compliance with regulations. The practice is also compatible with the principles of the circular economy, which emphasises the value of agricultural residues, agrarian economies, and sustainable waste management. Moreover, it is possible to optimise it with AI, emulate the use of blockchains to track feedstock, and adopt the concept of hybrid biofuel-electric to make the future of biofuel work more efficiently and easily tracked. Comprehensively, the paper demonstrates that agricultural waste can be a feasible and sustainable aviation biofeedstock of the next generation, as it can help minimise carbon footprints, make biofuels economically viable, and promote the current trend of carbon-neutral aircraft in the global community."

However, traditional SOCs often struggle to efficiently manage dynamic workloads and fluctuating network traffic. This research presents an Adaptive Security Operations Center (ASOC) that leverages rule-based mechanisms to optimize resource utilization and traffic analysis in real time. The ASOC adjusts its operations based on workload conditions: during low activity, it minimizes resource usage by performing autonomous analysis, reducing the need for human intervention, while under high-load conditions, it dynamically allocates additional resources and partially processes data to assist analysts. This adaptive approach ensures scalability, enhances operational efficiency, and balances computational and human resources, offering a more agile and effective solution to modern cybersecurity challenges."

In recent years, generative adversarial network (GAN) has emerged as a research hotspot in reservoir modeling. Aiming at the challenges associated with traditional GAN-based reservoir modeling algorithms, such as excessive parameters, high computational demands, significant memory usage, and substantial resource consumption, a lightweight well and seismic fusion reservoir modeling network (LightGAN) is proposed. The network employs shallow convolutional neural networks combined with Wasserstein distances to achieve fast and accurate modeling. In order to verify the effectiveness of the improved method, sedimentary facies data are used for experimental detection. The results show that LightGAN improves accuracy by more than $6 \\%$ relative to the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (CDCGAN) and shows incremental improvement over the state-of-the-art Generative facial prior GAN (GFPGAN). As training parameters increase, LightGAN’s performance gradually stabilizes, resulting in an enhancement in accuracy of over $\\mathbf{3 . 5 \\%}$."

We focus on the initial step and propose utilizing the discrete Riesz wavelets transform to mitigate residual speckle noise from the generated DInSAR phase map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using three important criteria: peak-to-signal-noise ratio (PSNR), the quality index Q, and the edge preservation index. The obtained metric values demonstrate that this technique can enhance both PSNR and Q compared to other well-known methods."

This paper provides a review of key research in DNFSs from 2020 to 2025, focusing on model structures, optimization methods, and approaches to achieving interpretability. Unlike previous reviews, we particularly emphasize the integration of Transformer networks with fuzzy systems, an area that has gained significant attention.

However, despite the widespread use and urgent demand for humidity sensors, a fundamental challenge persists: the underlying sensing mechanisms, particularly at atomic and molecular levels, often remain inadequately understood. This lack of mechanistic clarity hampers the rational design of nextgeneration sensors with enhanced sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and response speed. In this study, a molybdenum trioxide/zinc oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{MoO}_{3} / \\mathrm{ZnO}\\right)$ heterostructure was constructed and first-principles calculations were employed to conduct an in-depth investigation, at the atomic and electronic scales, into interfacial charge transfer at the $\\mathrm{MoO}_{3} / \\mathrm{ZnO}$ heterojunction and its adsorption characteristics toward water molecules. The results demonstrated that the adsorption energy (-1.395 eV) and charge transfer (0.083 e) of the $\\mathrm{MoO}_{3} / \\mathrm{ZnO}$ composite material with water molecules are higher than those of the pure MoO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf> and pure ZnO structures, indicating a stronger and more stable adsorption interactions between the $\\mathrm{MoO}_{3} / \\mathrm{ZnO}$ composite and H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>O molecules.

This study evaluates state-of-the-art segmentation models, categorized into UNet-based, encoder-decoder, and transformer-based architectures, using a dataset focused on aquatic plant segmentation in a natural environment. The model is evaluated using Dice coefficient, F1 score, IoU and overall accuracy, along with computational complexity measured by parameter count and GFLOPs. Results indicate that backbone-enhanced models outperform base configurations by providing deeper and more robust feature representations. Then, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are used to evaluate the model attention and ensure the precise focus of the network on ecologically meaningful regions. These insights not only highlight the importance of architectural depth and input diversity but also demonstrate how XAI can support iterative model refinement. As a result of these combined efforts, segmentation performance is improved from a baseline dice coefficient and accuracy of 50.76 and 85.07 % to a maximum 75.57 and 94.94 % respectively. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights of selecting suitable models in resource-constrained environments and advances the development of robust segmentation systems."

In this work, we present a proof-of-concept ORAN-aligned 5G slicing testbed built entirely using open-source components. The system integrates Open5GS as the 5G Core and UERANSIM for emulating gNB and UE behavior. Two static slices—eMBB and mMTC—are configured using distinct DNNs and dedicated UPF instances to enforce service-level isolation. Performance validation is conducted using iperf3-driven TCP and UDP traffic for the eMBB slice, achieving stable throughput over 50 Mbps in both uplink and downlink. The mMTC slice is simulated using synthetic telemetry-style traffic to reflect low-data-rate IoT scenarios. Prometheus and Grafana are integrated for end-to-end observability, enabling slice-specific metric collection and anomaly detection. Our modular, containerized design enables reproducibility and provides a foundation for future enhancements, including dynamic slicing and AI-driven RAN optimization."

Traditional control methods, based on fixed rules and signals, often fail to cope with the dynamics of traffic flows. In recent years, neural networks have shown significant potential in solving such problems due to their ability to process large volumes of data and identify complex patterns [1]. This study aims to develop and apply neural network models to generate production rules for traffic flow control systems, to improve the efficiency and resilience of transport systems. The proposed methodology involves using a neural network model to predict key indicators, such as capacity, while considering various factors that influence transport network elements. The model is then used to form consistent rules for the inference system by analyzing the model’s weights and applying an algorithm to evaluate factor significance."

However, existing VG datasets primarily focus on standard object recognition or semantic segmentation, often neglecting the interplay between visual content and semantic context. To address this issue, we propose a new task, Visual Reasoning for Remote Sensing Images, which requires models not only to localize objects but also to infer complex scene relationships and semantic connections. To support this task, we introduce LuoJia-VG dataset containing 40,903 image-referring expression-scene knowledge triplets. This dataset incorporates abundant scene knowledge on object relationships, functions, and potential activities, facilitating a deeper understanding of spatial and contextual dependencies in complex remote sensing images. By extending visual grounding task to visual reasoning, LuoJiaVG enables models to tackle more complex reasoning tasks, ultimately enhancing the understanding of semantic contexts in remote sensing scenes and supporting a broader range of geospatial applications. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on this dataset and establish a benchmark to facilitate future research in this task."

    "abstract": "Modern phased array radars are equipped with large number of phase shifters along with antenna elements in the front end of the system to accomplish beam steering. Beam steering directs the main lobe of a radiation pattern by adjusting the relative phases of these phase shifters of the antenna elements. The work puts forward design of a hierarchical digital beam steering network with programmable controllers at each level responsible for computation of the beam parameters such as phase and amplitude values for each radiating element of the radar for beam steering requirements in different modes of operation of radar. The design is also responsible for the beam synchronization with respect to the other subsystems of the radar and preparation of multiple control messages per burst to be sent to other subsystems for synchronised operation of the radar. In this work development and verification of the design are conducted concurrently and integrated throughout the design process enabling early verification of the design with respect to requirements.

Accurate computation requires three-dimensional FEM models with extremely fine meshes, resulting in a very large number of unknowns and demanding high-performance computing resources. This study investigates the detent torque computation of a two-phase hybrid stepper motor with a doublestack rotor configuration. Two different FEM formulations based on magnetic vector potential and magnetic scalar potential, and four meshes with increased density were used in the process."

These measurements can be stacked up over time to produce valuable information of the mean river flow as well as the variation around the mean, the spatial correlation structure, and the correlations between elevation and extent for each river measured by SWOT. This paper develops the methodology and explores the nuances of estimating the elevation and width profiles, as well as the variation at each node along a river from SWOT data. Spectral estimation of the deviation from the typical flow is also considered as well as height/width correlation estimation. Estimates of dark water occurrence rates that affect the measurability of the surface water from SWOT are also considered. A Bayes approach is also developed to apply the multitemporal information as prior information to reproduce the single-pass river node estimates with lower noise, while correcting corrupted and flagged measurements."

These are related to signal generation, function computation, and signal filtering. The solutions of AI tools are presented, analyzed, and compared with an in-house one, from the accuracy, clarity, and compactness criteria. The preliminary conclusion shows that all AI tools provide good solutions related to the considered signal processing tasks. The major concern is the choice of the parameters of the simulations when the experience and knowledge of the end user are dominant. The aspects discussed in this paper indicate the paths that should be followed when programming languages are involved for engineering applications, like signal processing.

Two architectures of BCD to 7-segment circuits are designed, one is single stage, and the other is dual stage circuits. Single stage circuit is implemented using static CMOS logic while the dual stage circuit is designed using AND OR logic arrays. BCD to 7-segment converter with four BCD inputs and seven output corresponding to segments a through g are implemented in Cadence Virtuoso simulation tool using gpdk090 with both the architectures. The propagation delay of all seven segments is determined for both the architectures. The output segments a through g for a single stage BCD to 7-segment converter circuit produced a propagation delay of 91.8 ps, 1036.4 ps, 80.69 ps, 95.86 ps, 1158.5 ps, 72.5 ps, and 83.3 ps, respectively. Similarly, the output segments a through g for dual stage BCD to 7-segment converter circuit produced a propagation delay of 92.93 ps, 399.5 ps, 80.68 ps, 102.6 ps, 266.5 ps, 90.83 ps, and 101.1 ps, respectively. Depending on the type of architecture it is found that the output segments a, d, f, and g of single stage converter circuit performed faster with lesser propagation delay as compared to its dual stage version. On the other hand, the output segments b, c, and e of the dual stage have the least propagation delay compared to its corresponding single stage circuit. Our results show the application of respective architectures for high-speed applications in digital VLSI displays and other circuits."

This study compares the two most commonly used materials in overhead transmission lines (OHTLs), glass and polymer insulators, in terms of energy losses due to LC. Sensors installed on OHTLs were used to monitor LC and weather parameters in real-time at two stations, both located near highway roads, which are exposed to similar environmental conditions. Each insulator string consisted of one insulator per string at the first station and seven insulators per string at the second station. Energy losses were evaluated across all three phases for both materials. The results demonstrate that polymer insulators exhibit significantly lower energy losses compared to glass insulators under similar environmental conditions. On average, polymer insulators reduced energy loss by approximately 81 % compared to glass insulators. Additionally, the form factor calculated was higher for polymer insulators <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(26.04)$</tex> compared to glass insulators <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(4.78)$</tex>, indicating better insulation.

Conventional techniques like transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in the past for image classification, however, they frequently demand high computational costs and have trouble accurately simulating spatiotemporal dependencies. Using the EuroSAT dataset we present EEMamba a novel framework created especially for satellite image classification using State Space Models (SSMs). These problems are resolved by EEMambas integration of SSMs which enable effective latent pattern extraction in multispectral data while preserving a lightweight architecture. This method improves classification accuracy while also lessening the computational load. A significant benefit of our framework is its capacity to maximize feature extraction by utilizing multispectral bands guaranteeing robustness against noise and resolution fluctuations. To measure EEMambas computational efficiency we perform a thorough analysis of floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) and performance enhancements. Large Earth observation datasets are among the real-time geospatial analysis applications that our framework can handle. We prove how EEMamba is a shining example of how state-space dynamics can revolutionize the analysis of geospatial images thus paving the way for future research that employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to address the evolving challenges in remote sensing image classification."

    "abstract": "Simulation models of public transportation systems are powerful tools for analyzing and optimizing transit networks. They help identify potential bottlenecks and evaluate alternative solutions in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. To ensure high accuracy, these models must integrate vehicle dynamics, road network characteristics, schedules, and the complex aspects of passenger behavior. Modeling passenger behavior presents unique challenges and requires a careful balance between simulation detail and model complexity. A critical component of this process is modeling passenger boarding and alighting, which directly influences system performance. Factors such as boarding speed, collision avoidance, crowd density, and station-specific features significantly affect dwell times at stops and the overall system efficiency. These variables are essential for generating precise estimates of travel times, operational costs, and service reliability. This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to modeling passenger boarding, incorporating realistic assumptions and behavioral patterns to enhance simulation accuracy. The proposed model is validated using simulations of Žilina’s public transport system, demonstrating its capability to capture complex interactions and deliver actionable insights. The model was also compared to existing estimates of group boarding times. By integrating these detailed modeling techniques, this study supports more informed decisions in urban transportation planning and enhances passenger satisfaction."

Experimental results showed that ILRMA performs well in anechoic conditions, while ILRMA+Dereverb maintains stable performance in reverberant environments. The MUSIC demonstrated high accuracy in anechoic conditions but was susceptible to degradation under reverberant conditions, particularly when used in conjunction with ILRMA+Dereverb.

These T/R modules are commanded through multiple LRUs arranged in multiple levels of hierarchy. The interconnection between these LRUs across all the levels of hierarchy starting from source till destination is quite complex because of the sheer high numbers and many other factors like closed the operating environment, narrow space available for routing, small volume for installation etc. Thus designing, routing and managing thousands of such cables becomes quite a daunting task. This paper presents the challenges in the designing of the control cables optimized for minimum cable diameter and bending radius through iterative designs thereby enabling efficient routing of the cables through narrow ducts. At the same time, it is ensured that stringent performance criterion is met from each of these control cable. Because the operating environment is closed, it is also mandated to comply to Low Smoke Zero Halogen emissions from each cable in case of fire, which in turn is a contradictory requirement for achieving minimum cable diameter. This paper presents the various optimization techniques and best practices involved in the design and realization of different types of control cables. The cables are successfully realized, tested, performance evaluated and finally deployed in the array."

We present TemporalFormer, an enhanced EfficientFormerV2 model, optimized for fast and accurate deepfake detection directly on mobile and edge platforms. TemporalFormer analyzes video streams by extracting 30 equidistant frames from a 6 -second window by capturing a frame from live screen at 200 ms intervals and processing a batch of 30 frames in single prediction. This enables real-time processing of dynamic content like video calls, social media feeds, and video conferences. This lightweight framework integrates EfficientFormerV2’s feature extraction with positional encoding and a 1D CNN layer to model temporal dependencies, achieving an inference time of 20 ms per batch. Trained and tested on Celeb-df(v2), TemporalFormer attains an accuracy of $93.2 \\%$ and an AUC of 0.90, while demonstrating robust generalization with an AUC of 0.87 on the FaceForensics++ dataset during crosscorpora analysis, surpassing baselines such as Xception and EfficientNet-B0 in both performance and efficiency.

Accurate forecasting of foF2 values is critical for optimizing HF communication technologies. However, the complex, nonlinear and dynamic nature of ionospheric variations caused by solar activity and atmospheric conditions makes it a huge challenge. International reference ionosphere relies on semi-empirical formulas with substantial prediction errors, while some data-driven variants focus mainly on time series predictions derived from individual stations, thus ignoring the inter-station correlations that are closely related to the model accuracy and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STG-foF2) to address the above issues of ionospheric forecasting in the context of HF communication, which leverages a cascade structure of graph convolutional layers and long short-term memory layers to extract the intricate patterns and connections across diverse geographical locations and temporal intervals. Extensive experiments on Global ionospheric radio observatory datasets verify the superior performance in terms of accuracy and time complexity of the proposed STG-foF2 over the existing benchmarks under different geomagnetic activity states."

    "abstract": "Integrating domain knowledge into machine learning models enhances both predictive accuracy and theoretical consistency, particularly for problems governed by differential equations. While traditional machine learning (ML) techniques provide flexible data-driven approximations, they often disregard underlying physical constraints, leading to reduced generalizability. Embedding governing equations within learning frameworks has shown promise in scientific computing but remains underexplored in financial modelling. This work formulates a Physics-Informed Least Squares Support Vector Machine (PI-LS-SVM), incorporating differential equation constraints within the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) framework to improve function approximation under physical constraints. To validate its effectiveness, PI-LS-SVM is applied to solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (BS PDE), a fundamental model in option pricing. The method is trained using real-world data and benchmarked against standard SVM and LS-SVM models. Empirical results demonstrate that PI-LS-SVM achieves higher accuracy, reduced pricing errors, and improved robustness against market fluctuations, outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. The integration of physicsbased constraints enhances model stability and interpretability, reinforcing the broader applicability of physics-informed learning in constrained optimization problems. By bridging computational intelligence with structured modelling, this study highlights PI-LS-SVM as a generalizable framework for solving physicsinformed machine learning problems, with applications extending beyond finance into AI-driven modelling and engineering systems."

The conclusion is that while block chain is still being institutionalized in certain sectors (traceability, settlement), its usage in politics (voting, identification) remains pilot-stage and context-dependent."

It focuses on addressing uncertainties inherent in clinical cardiac monitoring by systematically reviewing modern signal processing techniques, neural network architectures, and diagnostic support systems, and evaluating their effectiveness in arrhythmia detection and classification. Through a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning approaches versus deep learning architectures, the research identifies critical limitations in existing systems, including architectural complexity, interpretability constraints, and uncertainty management. Our analysis reveals that while current deep learning models achieve classification accuracies ranging from 83-98%, they often sacrifice computational efficiency and clinical interpretability. We propose a framework for evaluating ECG processing systems that balances accuracy, computational complexity, and clinical applicability. The findings show that one-dimensional convolutional neural networks offer the best trade-offs between performance (91-93% accuracy) and practical deployment constraints, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare and the availability of expert cardiologists are limited. This comprehensive review offers essential insights into developing next-generation cardiac diagnostic systems that effectively manage uncertainty while supporting clinical relevance."

In this study, in addition to using chromaticity components that are difficult for humans to recognize the superimposed data signal, we aim to improve the communication quality by using discrete cosine transformation (DCT) to superimpose the data signal in the low-frequency region, which is less susceptible to signal loss even when captured from a long distance."

Current approaches to this challenge often rely on rigid control schemes or task-specific automations that do not adapt well to dynamic environments or varied operator needs. This article presents a novel large language model (LLM)-aided bimanual teleoperation assistant (BTLA) that helps operators control dual-arm robots through an intuitive voice command interface and variable autonomy. The BTLA system enables a hybrid control paradigm by combining natural language interaction for an assistive robot arm with direct teleoperation of the dominant robotic arm. Our system implements six core manipulation skills with varying autonomy, ranging from direct mirroring to autonomous object manipulation. The BTLA leverages the LLM to interpret natural language commands and select an appropriate assistance mode based on task requirements and operator preferences. Experimental validation on bimanual object manipulation tasks demonstrates that the BTLA system yields a 240.8% increase in success rate over solo teleoperation and a 69.9% increase over dyadic teleoperation, while significantly reducing operator mental workload. In addition, we validate our approach on a physical dual-arm UR3e robot system, achieving a 90% success rate on challenging soft bottle handling and box transportation tasks."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of consumer electronics, especially through immersive embedded cyber-physical systems, has intensified the complexity of access control in decentralized environments such as the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT). In critical applications like crowdsourced drone services for bushfire management, ensuring secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable data sharing among multiple stakeholders remains a major challenge. Existing blockchain-based or traditional access control methods often impose significant communication overhead, scalability bottlenecks, and privacy risks due to centralized or publicly auditable structures. This paper introduces a novel access management architecture that leverages Verifiable Credentials (VCs), which, unlike blockchain approaches, enable decentralized, fine-grained, and revocable authorizations without exposing sensitive information or incurring heavy computational costs. By integrating a cloud-based VC wallet, our system abstracts credential handling away from client applications, thereby enhancing interoperability and enabling seamless, standards-compliant collaboration among diverse drone operators and bushfire management authorities. The result is a framework that not only ensures robust data integrity and privacy but also delivers agile, efficient management of access rights, directly addressing the unique security and usability demands of immersive IoDT environments."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Remote sensing images pose significant challenges for object detection due to their high resolution, complex backgrounds, large scale variations, and dense distribution of small targets. To address these issues, we propose an improved remote sensing object detection model based on YOLOv8, named Adaptive Frequency Global-Local Feature Fusion Model on YOLO (AFGLFF-YOLO). This model is optimized in two aspects: frequency domain feature preservation and cross-scale information construction. Firstly, an Adaptive Frequency Wavelet Downsample (AFWD) module is designed to effectively retain structural high-frequency details during the downsample phase. Secondly, in the feature extraction phase, a dual-channel structure combining frequency-response Wavelet-Guided Vision GNN-CNN (WGVGC) is introduced. Its fundamental module is the Vision GNN-CNN (VGC), where graph convolution and depthwise separable convolution collaboratively enhance the complementarity of global and local features. Furthermore, to mitigate the interference between high- and low-frequency features within the same feature space, a frequency guidance mechanism derived from wavelet decomposition is introduced. This mechanism employs the Daubechies4 (DB4) wavelet and Haar wavelet for feature frequency differentiation. Subsequently, the Global Low-Frequency Enhancement Fusion Module (GLFM) and Edge-Aware High-Frequency Enhancement Fusion Module (EHFM) are designed to achieve complementary enhancement of cross-frequency domain features through adaptive frequency fusion. Finally, experimental results on four public remote sensing object detection datasets, NWPU VHR-10, RSOD, DIOR and RS-STOD, demonstrate that AFGLFF-YOLO achieves mAP@50 of 95.6%, 97.6%, 79.6% and 83.1%, respectively, marking a significant improvement over the original YOLOv8 model. These experimental results validate the detection accuracy, feature representation capability, and robustness of the proposed method in complex remote sensing scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of global-local fusion and frequency domain feature enhancement."

    "abstract": "This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly sophisticated \"cognitive examinations.\" We argue that the field is undergoing a paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test \"what\" a model sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe \"why\" and \"how\" it understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks, where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey from the foundational \"knowledge tests\" of the ImageNet era to the \"applied logic and comprehension\" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey the current frontier of \"expert-level integration\" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench, SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today’s powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Next, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative, and social intelligence. We also discuss the emerging \"Post-2025\" landscape, where rapid saturation of reasoning benchmarks by models like Gemini 3 Pro necessitates a shift toward \"living\" adversarial evaluations. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating truly intelligent systems."

    "abstract": "Due to the varying circumstances, thus resulting in frequently changed system plant, the controller must also varies with time increases. This paper proposes supervisory multi switching data driven control strategy from both theoretical analysis and practical application. Specifically, multi switching control strategy and data driven control are combined together to achieve the dual goals, i.e. multi models selection and multi controllers selection, while determining the appropriate model and active controller through two optimization criterions. Firstly, the detailed academic theories center around data driven identification, multidimensional Taylor network structure, data driven switching controller for model tracking or mismatch and guaranteed optimal analysis, corresponding to switching models selection, switching controllers selection and optimal switching logic respectively. Secondly, the theoretical results are supported by automatic takeoff and landing of unmanned helicopter, as the entire automatic takeoff and landing are separated into five continuous subprocess. To better understanding the control principle for automatic takeoff and landing process, three different subjects are analyzed in constraint analysis, automatic takeoff control and landing control, leading to devise each controller for each subprocess by supervisory multi switching control, and constructing one supervisor mechanism to achieve the switching logic. Finally, one practical platform is shown to prove our theoretical analysis. Generally, roughly speaking, our paper introduces data driven idea into switching control to form an innovative multi switching data driven control, i.e, switching model identification and switching tracking control, while covering identification, control, optimization and application etc."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the AIGC wave reshaping the creative design landscape, color design is rapidly transitioning from intuition-driven to data-intelligence. However, a critical \"semantic gap\" persists between abstract human intentions and controllable parameters of generative tools. To address this challenge, this study proposes and neurocognitively validates a computational framework for semantic color design, grounded in the Chinese linguistic context. The framework integrates two core modules: 1) Semantic Deconstruction, which constructs a multidimensional color-semantic lexicon from Chinese multisource texts using natural language processing and 2) Parametric Mapping, which establishes a controllable model to map structured semantics to quantitative color parameters in the perceptually uniform CIELAB space. Critically, we employed event-related potentials to validate the framework’s semantic accuracy in this cultural context. Neuroscientific evidence has confirmed that colors generated by our framework elicit cognitive responses consistent with target semantics; the N400 effect was statistically equivalent to that of a highly congruent baseline (equivalence test, p < 0.01). The study further revealed a hierarchical contribution of color attributes to semantic conveyance: hue played a decisive role, followed by brightness, whereas the influence of saturation was limited. The proposed framework not only offers a scientific paradigm for bridging the semantic gap in color design but also provides a computational blueprint for next-generation AIGC tools, enabling them to move beyond randomness toward precise, controllable, and semantically meaningful color generation."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is critical for global carbon cycle research and climate policies such as REDD+, but single remote sensing sources face limitations: optical sensors suffer from saturation and cloud interference, SAR has saturation and terrain-induced distortions, and lidar (e.g., GEDI) provides high-precision vertical structures but sparse coverage. Multi-source data fusion - including data-level, feature-level, decision-level fusion, and spatio-temporal scaling - leverages the complementary strengths of optical, SAR, and LiDAR data to mitigate these issues, machine learning (e.g., RF, XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., CNN, Transformer) to improve performance, and hybrid models to balance learning ability and robustness. Key challenges including data heterogeneity, geometric/radiometric inconsistencies, saturation in dense forests, cloud-induced optical data loss, and sparse GEDI footprints are addressed through validation frameworks (involving forest maps, NFI, airborne LiDAR) and uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., spatial cross-validation, Monte Carlo simulations). Regional case studies (Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia) show optimal strategies for specific environments, while future directions focus on collaborative GEDI with P-band SAR, dynamic monitoring through temporal fusion, physical based deep learning, federated/transfer learning, interpretable AI, and standardized REDD+ protocols. Based on a systematic review of AGB estimation studies in tropical forests in the past five years, this paper summarizes the development progress of multi-source remote sensing data fusion and advanced algorithms, identifies the existing technical bottlenecks, and proposes a future-oriented comprehensive optimization framework to improve the accuracy and robustness of AGB estimation."

    "abstract": "Energy management strategy (EMS) has a significant impact on the lithium-ion battery/supercapacitor combined hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) of electric vehicles. However, existing strategies often suffer from inefficient energy allocation and poor dynamic response. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL)-based EMS to optimize the efficiency of HESS. Firstly, key road features are extracted from vehicle operation data using a sliding window, and then principal component analysis and an optimized K-nearest neighbors’ algorithm are used for feature dimensionality reduction and clustering, which can enable more precise feature classification under various road conditions. Secondly, a dueling double deep fuzzy Q-network (D3FQN) framework is proposed for real-time power allocation optimization. By combining the uncertainty handling capability of the fuzzy inference system with the efficient learning ability of the dueling architecture, the real-time adaptively decision-making ability of HESS can be enhanced under complex road conditions. Additionally, an adaptive reward function is designed to dynamically adjust the allocation strategy according to real-time road conditions, power demand, and battery status. Finally, the physical and comparative experiments are conducted, and the results validated the strong dynamic adaptability and efficient energy allocation of the proposed strategy across various road conditions."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images (HRRSIs) is essential for various geospatial applications. While recent transformer-based models demonstrate promising global modeling capabilities, they are susceptible to attention noise—particularly in cluttered or noisy scenes—leading to degraded segmentation quality. This challenge is amplified in HRRSIs, where spatially heterogeneous noise and ambiguous object boundaries are prevalent. To address this problem, we propose PDDFormer, a Position-aware Differential Denoising Transformer tailored for semantic segmentation of HRRSIs. Central to our design is the Spatially Gated Differential Attention (SGDA), which adaptively modulates denoising strength across spatial positions using a learnable gate. Unlike prior differential attention models, SGDA introduces position-aware denoising that dynamically adjusts attention suppression at each token, guided by spatial semantics. This allows PDDFormer to suppress redundant background responses while preserving critical structural semantics. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks, ISPRS Potsdam and LoveDA, demonstrate that PDDFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and boundary preservation. Moreover, PDDFormer achieves favorable performance-efficiency trade-offs, making it practical for large-scale geospatial analysis. Visualizations further confirm the model’s ability to generate cleaner, more coherent segmentation maps, validating the effectiveness of our spatially adaptive denoising strategy."

    "abstract": "Hybrid beamforming (HBF) offers a cost effective solution for multiple-input multiple-output dual-functional radar-communication (MIMO-DFRC) systems by reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. While narrowband HBF has been widely studied, wideband HBF design, particularly for transceiver-side hybrid architectures, remains rather underexplored. Existing HBF methods for wideband MIMO-DFRC systems typically adopt a sequential optimization (SO) framework based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM), assuming a fully digital receiver architecture during the initial optimization stage. This assumption restricts the design flexibility and limits the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) on the communication side. To this end, an integrated constrained manifold optimization (ICMO) framework is proposed. The ICMO method embeds the transmit and receive HBF matrices, subject to constant modulus (CM) and transmit power per subcarrier, into an integrated variable and projects them onto an ICM-space for joint optimization. This transforms the original constrained problem into an unconstrained manifold optimization problem. Subsequently, a parallel simplified quasi-Newton (PSQN) method is developed to optimize the integrated variable within the ICMO framework, ultimately yielding the transmit and receive HBF coding matrices. Simulation results under a Pareto behavior analysis show that the proposed method dominates the CADMM baseline across the SSME and SE frontier, achieving up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$40\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> higher SE at comparable SSME and about 4.4 dB lower sidelobe levels, thereby enabling spectrum efficient and low sidelobe DFRC design."

    "abstract": "Island nations are particularly vulnerable to dynamic coastal changes influenced by both natural and human factors and, specifically, coastline; the intersection between land and water, and its changes over a time period reflect the evolutionary information about the resources and ecosystem of the coastal region [1]. To acquire essential information on the intensity of changes, extracting coastline, particularly for the island countries, is crucial. Remotely sensed satellite imagery is considered an important data source for continuously monitoring the coastal area and its alterations. It has opened an effective way to conduct research work as it provides frequent data with a large coverage [2]. Consequently, the detection and extraction processes of coastlines from different medium and high-resolution satellite images have been developed [3]. Therefore, automatic extraction techniques, including edge detection, band thresholding [4], and classification approach [5], have been applied in satellite images to acquire coastline information within a short period of time. However, to extract the coastline of a small atoll island, using a specific coastline extraction method becomes challenging due to the complex and distinct coastal features. Therefore, an automatic method combining segmentation and thresholding is proposed to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images to delineate the coastline from the satellite image. Funafuti Atoll, an archipelago of small, scattered islets with unique features, was selected as the study region for extracting the coastline and analyzing the recent coastal alterations. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and sea level information were utilized to extract coastline and analyze coastal alterations. At first, resampling was performed to convert the required bands into the same resolution (10 m). Then, NDVI was calculated in the resampled images because it enhances the contrast between the land and water, which is regarded as a crucial part of the coastline extraction process. Afterwards, superpixel segmentation method was applied to segment the image into smaller area, and then, segmented areas of target islet regions were linked to NDVI values. To account for the unique features of each islet, adaptive thresholding was utilized to differentiate between land and water accurately, enabling the extraction of coastlines from 2019 to 2023. Subsequently, sea level data corresponding to the image acquisition periods was incorporated to adjust the DEM for each year. This adjustment involves adding or subtracting sea level values to reflect temporal variations accurately. The adjusted DEMs and extracted coastlines were then overlaid to identify spatial shifts, highlighting areas of erosion or accretion. To quantify these changes, the land area lost or gained was analyzed, and the elevation differences between adjusted DEMs were used to estimate the volume of material displaced. The estimated volume was calculated by multiplying elevation changes by pixel area, providing insights into the scale of erosion or accretion over time. The study depicts that the length of the coastline decreased by approximately 0.27 %, and the vegetation area decreased by approximately 3.52 %. Most of the alterations happened in the eastern part of Funafuti, which were caused by human intervention and tropical cyclones."

    "abstract": "Recovering the in-air colours of seafloor from satellite imagery is a challenging task due to the exponential attenuation of light with depth in the water column. In this study, we present DichroGAN, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) designed for this purpose. DichroGAN employs a two-steps simultaneous training: first, two generators utilise a hyperspectral image cube to estimate diffuse and specular reflections, thereby obtaining atmospheric scene radiance. Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission. These generators work together to remove the effects of light absorption and scattering, restoring the in-air colours of seafloor based on the underwater image formation equation. DichroGAN is trained on a compact dataset derived from PRISMA satellite imagery, comprising RGB images paired with their corresponding spectral bands and masks. Extensive experiments on both satellite and underwater datasets demonstrate that DichroGAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art underwater restoration techniques."

    "abstract": "Origin-destination (O-D) travel time estimation is among the most important problems studied in transportation. It focuses on determining accurate travel time from a specific origin point to a destination point. Given the development of new technologies such as GPS and mobile applications, this data can be easily gathered, improving the estimation of the O-D travel time and enabling prediction in almost real-time. Currently, one of the simplest and newest algorithms is the $KNN - \\bar WH$ model, an improvement of the K-Nearest Neighbors method with Haversine distance and a correction factor. Unfortunately, the direct application of this method can take over 50 minutes to predict a new set of 70,000 data points. This paper proposes $k - KNN - \\bar WH$, a new two-step framework that clusters the data using k-means and then applies $KNN - \\bar WH$ on the corresponding cluster. The empirical results show a minimal impact on the MAPE performance (1.5%) while reducing the time estimation process from approximately 50 to 20 minutes."

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of proximity relationships between individuals and groups in urban spaces is critical for public safety alerts, emergency evacuation planning, commercial flow analysis, and urban planning optimization. Existing indoor localization techniques-including TOA/TDOA/AoA geometry-based methods, visual SLAM, inertial navigation (PDR), and RSSI/UWB fingerprinting-achieve high accuracy in static environments but rely heavily on large-scale manual labeling, strict clock synchronization, or dense anchor deployment, and struggle to accommodate both trajectory continuity and dynamic environmental changes. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-modal deep learning framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Multidimensional Scaling embedding. First, channel feature similarities are computed from CIR sequences sampled continuously by mobile terminals, and an attentionenhanced proximity graph is constructed. Then, the graph adjacency matrix is fed into the MDS algorithm to recover the relative low-dimensional layout of observation points, enabling robust reconstruction of crowd density and flow topology. To mitigate class imbalance and manage positive and negative pair ratios both within and across trajectories, we introduce a spatiotemporal pair generation strategy and employ a weighted binary crossentropy loss during training. Simulation results demonstrate that under sparse sampling and dynamic conditions, our method significantly outperforms traditional thresholding and existing unsupervised baselines in both precision and recall, and approaches the performance of supervised methods under moderate label noise. This framework offers an efficient, annotation-free solution for indoor crowd density estimation and flow analysis."

Key decision-making factors are identified, and their availability in real-world datasets is assessed. Based on data from a selected urban area, we designed and generated suitable optimization models for experimental verification (TRL3). The research results were compared with a parallel optimization process independently conducted by the cooperated city, using only basic input and map data. Particular attention was paid to the number and nature of external factors considered by the city when deciding to cancel or merge waste collection points. Finally, we evaluated the practical applicability of the selected methods and identifies key factors for relevant city’s decision-making processes to improve efficiency and resident satisfaction."

Among such methods, coverage control has promising applications in tasks such as surveillance, exploration, and environmental sensing. However, in coverage control using CSMA/CA, degraded control quality due to communication collisions is a problem. To address this issue, information transfer methods, where each agent transfers the received position information to its neighbors, have been proposed. In previous studies, evaluations assumed agents moved using a uniform linear motion model. In environments where position observation is noisy, the convergence tends to degrade. This paper introduces a PID control model for agent motion in coverage control with information transfer. We compare its control quality to that of the uniform linear motion model, and clarify the influence of PID gains on control quality."

In India there are 22 scheduled languages. Top Large language models such as Chat-GPT supports only limited languages. On the other-hand AI4Bharat shows highly efficient Multilingual translation benchmarks. However, in prompt engineering, using LLM alone as a translator often leads to hallucinated outputs lacking context, defaulting to the most common meaning of words and producing extremely bookish language. Fine-tuning the LLM models to support all the languages is costly. This work explores the challenges in machine translation of native languages when using prompt engineering as well as the transformative role of an LLM with the AI4Bharat transformer as a sophisticated language interface, enabling seamless communication across Indic languages with remarkable translation quality. In this study, the performance of AI4Bharat transformers is evaluated using Samsung consumer electronics offers dataset. The proposed translation pipeline integrates IndicTrans2 and Mistral models to benchmark the translation accuracy. By selecting evaluation metrics that focus on translation quality and contextual accuracy, the limitations are addressed. Leveraging RAG Framework with Mistral and IndicTrans2, the approach enhances translation performance for sector-specific offers, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized LLM prompts and transformers in improving multilingual translations.

    "abstract": "Infertility presents a pressing clinical and societal challenge, yet its study is constrained by the scarcity of representative data. Public health datasets such as NHANES contain rich physiological, behavioural, and demographic features but are limited by severe class imbalance, with infertile cases representing only a small minority. This imbalance reduces the sensitivity and generalizability of machine learning models applied to infertility prediction. Traditional rebalancing strategies, such as oversampling, are insufficient for capturing the complex hormonal, psychosocial, and environmental interactions underlying infertility. This paper reviews advances in synthetic data generation as a means to address these limitations. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer statistical realism and coverage, while large language models (LLMs) introduce the possibility of embedding domain knowledge and clinical constraints directly into synthetic case creation. These approaches promise to enrich minority-class representation, enhance predictive robustness, and improve fairness in reproductive health modelling. At the same time, they raise new challenges of validation, transparency, and ethical oversight. By synthesizing insights across existing methods, this review highlights infertility as a critical test case for generative $\\mathbf{A I}$ and argues that progress depends not only on technical innovation but also on developing trustworthy frameworks for clinical deployment."

    "abstract": "The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has reached a stage of maturity where the social acceptance of these systems is becoming as important as coping with technical challenges. Most users complain that ADAS functions behave unnaturally, and they feel anxious because the driving system behaves in a way that is far from what the user prefers. One of the most controversial ADAS functions is Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA). This system detects the edge of the lane and drives the car actively by intervening on the steering wheel. Most available lane keeping follows the center of the lane, while the vehicle controller oscillates and often deviates from this line. Most people find this operation disturbing and unreliable. In our work, we propose a comprehensive Model Predictive Planner and Control that preserves the basic concept of how human drivers drive: they instinctively create the combined representation of the environment and the vehicle, and predictevely plan their action trajectory (i.e., steering angle). This method does not divide the driving task into planning and control, thereby improving tunability. On the other hand, the method provides direct relation to vehicle dynamics and high-level policies, and therefore it can be validated easier than end-to-end trained functions, such as neural networks. The initial algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and validated via simulation.

The measurement system, comprising calibrated sensors and data acquisition units, enabled real-time monitoring of structural response under test loads. Procedures for signal processing, data analysis and extraction of key dynamic parameters are described, alongside the criteria applied for interpreting the experimental results.

    "abstract": "Text-generated images have a wide range of applications in the field of remote sensing. Previous work on remote sensing image generation was mainly based on GAN, whereas the excellent performance of the Diffusion model has remained unexplored. In this work, we present RS-DiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer for generating remote sensing images conditioned on text discriptions. The main idea of RS-DIT is to predict the noise to be removed through conditional information in the input noise image, and generate remote sensing images that meet specific needs through diffusion. We use the semantic differences between remote sensing images of different categories and the text description information of a single image as conditional input, so that the generated images can achieve good results in semantic generalization and accurate description. In order to evaluate the difference between our model and previous GAN and transformer-based methods, we used zero-shot classification, FID, Inception, and clip score to evaluate the authenticity, diversity, and semantic relevance of the generated images. Experimental results demontrate that our method achieves SOTA performance."

This can be useful in simulations in hazard situations, earthquake simulations or architecture, archaeology, engineering and defense contexts. However, modeling this type of complex structure requires a significant amount of time and manual work, especially when it comes to designing and planning the interior according to important parameters, such as room size and ratio. This paper presents a method for procedurally generating interior floor plans, based on buildings extracted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This approach subdivides a building into rooms and corridors, parametrized by room area and room ratio, based only on its geometry. This method is designed to adapt to imperfect data with an unspecified orientation. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a user study with 29 participants. The results show that this approach is particularly strong in how it handles imperfect information and manages space and is stronger at generating smaller rooms. This method provides a fast and effective way to generate building interiors, independently of their orientation or the existence of imperfect data, with a focus on the study of shock wave propagation through them."

    "abstract": "Secure digital identity management is every emerging concern. Traditional authentication which includes use of passwords, central databases, and third party recovery present great security and also usability issues. Zero- Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and blockchain have put forth as very good for Decentralized identity systems. But also many present solutions have large compute requirements, don’t scale well, and have poor user recovery. This review puts forth that in present ZKP based identity systems we see the lack of password less login, human readable identities, and self sovereign recovery. We look at recent systems which we note have a heavy use of complex crypto credentials, central verification which is a point of failure, and extensive infrastructure which in turn do not see wide scale adoption. To present solutions to these issues we have put forth a UID based identity which uses ZKPs for authentication which does not require storage of passwords or private keys. We introduce a novel recovery which uses a human readable phrase from private key, salt, and UID which in turn is a user controlled method. What we did is we put the UID on the blockchain which in turn improves privacy and scale. Our analysis which we present improves on issues of usability, scale and security which in turn we present a very simple and practical solution for today’s identity management issues. Also this study we present which we put forth to be the base for what we think will be future works in the development of useable ZKP based identity systems."

    "abstract": "The challenges of making semiconductor technologies work reliably, in terms of yield, fault-tolerance, have escalated dramatically, due to the rapid scale-down into the nanoscale regime, and these challenges are even more acute in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) systems. Traditional Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) tools, well known as the backbone of digital verification, are increasingly not keeping up with the stochastic and dynamic fault model of the advanced nodes. The techniques tend to overedit to a priori fault models, like stuck-at or transition fault models, and thus are not very flexible to newer defect patterns. Furthermore, their over-reliance on exhaustive backtracking and deterministic search, inject too much computational overhead and redundant test vectors that weaken efficiency while managing silicon lifecycle (SLM). Enter recent cutting-edge developments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) the prospect of probabilistic models learning complicated patterns of defect incidence, and the apparent need to revisit traditional to the world understanding of diffusional phenomena. Of these, diffusion models are notable in the variety and high quality of the samples of data they are able to produce by iteratively removing noise using generative annealing, rendering them useful at preserving distributional diversity yet alleviating mode collapse, one of the more faults of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this paper, we develop a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) framework that is automatic test pattern synthesis oriented in nanoscale VLSI systems. Wide-scale data consisting of defect and failure trace data (combined with benchmark circuit data) is used to train fault-aware representations that generalize beyond classical fault models. Incorporating such an approach into an SLM pipeline can enable a model to be adaptively retrained using incremental defect data such that the ultimate relevance is maintained throughout the device life cycle. Experimental results on the ITC-99 benchmark circuits show a 22 percent enhancement in fault coverage over the traditional ATPG and GAN-based synthesis and a 40 percent decrease in run time, and, further, it produces statistically diverse test vectors with no addition of test vectors. The scalability of the approach to medium-to-large circuits is further demonstrated by a detailed case study and demonstrates a greater diversity of fault activation in a circuit with increased robustness. These findings indicate that there would be a paradigm shift of the application of electronic tests strategy and diffusion-driven synthesis stands tall as a viable and dynamic solution to and management of reliable microelectronic devices."

The main purpose of this model design is to capture both spatial and temporal features in the ECG signals simultaneously. Experimental results show that our model achieved outstanding performance on the MIT - BIH arrhythmia dataset (2017 competition version): it exhibited a significantly higher macro F1 score of 0.914 and a specificity of 0.987, which surpasses the 0.82 macro F1 score of traditional CNN LSTM concatenated hybrid models.

    "abstract": "Cement accounts for approximately 8% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, and traditional cement production is a major culprit of this. Sustainable alternatives are imperative to lessen the environmental impact of the construction industry so urgently. The invention described herein proposes an innovative enzymatic carbon sequestering bio-cement that utilizes microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) to develop a low-carbon and self-healing cement substitution. Rather than allowing the aggregates to disperse or settle out of suspension, a bioanalytical approach is used, which takes advantage of urease-producing bacteria like Sporosarcina pasteurii for capturing atmospheric CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> through biochemical reactions that precipitate CaCO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf> while binding aggregates as well. This process is different from conventional cement, requiring ambient temperature, which reduces energy consumption and lowers emissions. The experimental results show that bio-cements possess similar compressive strength, long service life, and the ability to self-heal micro-cracks, thereby increasing the life span of the infrastructure and reducing maintenance costs. Furthermore, the life cycle assessment shows a huge decrease in the carbon footprint of Portland cement. This means that enzymatic bio cement has the potential to change green construction by providing a scalable, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly replacement for conventional cement. We would identify ways in the future to improve bacterial performance, large-scale implementation, and integration with current multi-part construction practices to rapidly accelerate the adoption of bio cement in public and private implementations."

    "abstract": "Chiplet is the technological and structural architecture of an emerging computer system. It is an architecture that integrates heterogeneous components such as SoC, SiP, multichip, package, silicon die, and CPU. These structural components form the logical architectures: Chiplet GPU, Chiplet Memory, Chiplet I/O, Chiplet Interconnects. For the market, chip-let has a clear advantage over Monolithic Chips, which is determined by the following properties: Improved Yield, Flexibility, Scalability, and Heterogeneous Integration. As part of emerging computing, a Chiplet is just logic, represented by structures and functions, and nothing else. Chiplet Interconnects are no exception – this is also logic. A systematic approach to modeling, simulation, and testing the logic of Chiplet Interconnects, the model of which is represented by a logical vector, is proposed. The basic paradigm is that any logic should be tested systematically against logical faults that are in the good-value model of the structure or functionality, either explicitly or implicitly. Any physical defects in components or bus Interconnects in the Chiplet architecture manifest as logic faults. Defects violate the logic of any computing device, including bus structures. This means that any physical defects manifest themselves as logical faults. This means generating system tests that cover combinations of logic faults. A Modelling test card is offered, which is a logical relationship between a comprehensive test and all combinations of logic faults. A logic vector is all you need to model a Chiplet Interconnects test map in three matrix operations. As well as any structure and functionality, it can be represented by a logical vector for modeling a test map. In addition, a logical vector is also a data structure for graph rendering of the validity of a process or phenomenon model. A logical vector is the simplest model that is convenient for simulating on a computer and rendering the results for a human. Modeling and rendering on the logical vector harmoniously complement each other in solving market problems. Examples and processing time of bus, graph structures, and functionalities for modeling a test map and graph rendering models are given. All mechanisms for modeling and rendering test maps for functions and structures are embedded in the Python language codes, which are exposed in cyberspace as an open-source application."

This technique uses InSAR histograms that are obtained by mapping each pixel in a SAR interferogram to a particular height bin according to its corresponding interferometric phase. This approach potentially enables the estimation of forest vertical structure, from which surface topography and tree height can be retrieved. In this work, the vertical profiles obtained using the Histomography technique are compared with the LiDAR waveforms to assess strengths and limitations of the method. The SAR dataset is a stack of fully-polarimetric L-band UAVSAR images acquired over the Howland Forest, USA, in summer 2021, while LVIS LiDAR waveforms are considered the reference data. The comparison between the SAR profiles and the LiDAR measurements indicates that Histomography effectively captures the vertical structure of the forest."

A critical review of the shortcomings of the classic mechanical transmission is presented, highlighting significant energy losses (up to 18-23%), high operational costs, and poor ergonomics. The transition to an electric drive is proposed as a solution. The paper provides a comparative analysis of various electric drive concepts, including direct engine replacement and wheel-hub motors, and justifies the choice of the most balanced scheme — the use of individual axle-specific electric motors with compact gearboxes. Based on detailed calculations of the parameters of the existing MTZ-82 transmission (wheel torque, rotational speed), technical specifications for designing the electric drive system have been developed. Key requirements are defined: a peak motor torque of 300 N•m, a rated power of 120 kW per axle, a gearbox ratio of 140:1, and a high protection class of IP67. The technical and economic analysis demonstrates that the proposed modernization can increase the overall efficiency of the power plant by 25-30% and reduce operational costs by 40-45% due to lower maintenance and fuel expenses. The service life of the system's key components should be at least 20,000 hours for the electric motors. The developed approach preserves the tractor's operational characteristics while significantly improving its energy efficiency and environmental friendliness."

In this work, we propose a planar \"SL U-GaN HEMT,\" where sidewall GaN layers connect the superlattice two-dimensional electron/hole gases, enabling all access-region channels to conduct. Two-dimensional technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations confirm normally-off behavior with a threshold voltage of approximately 4 V for the n-type SL U-GaN HEMT. The n-type SL U-GaN HEMT delivers over 3 times higher drain current than the regular SL GaN HEMT, while the p-type variant shows significantly reduced gate leakage. These results demonstrate that the planar SL U-GaN architecture addresses the channel utilization limitation of planar SL GaN HEMTs and provides a path for planar GaN CMOS integration."

    "abstract": "Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a balance between previously learned and newly introduced knowledge. Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF."

    "abstract": "The intrinsic characteristics of music affect the brain by activating specific areas that alter its electrical activity. Understanding this behavior can support relevant applications, but high dimensionality hinders model interpretability, performance, and generalization. Therefore, selecting the most informative channels would reduce complexity, lower computational cost, and potentially improve classification performance. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify the musical genre associated with an acoustic stimulus based on the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, aiming to overcome the high dimensionality of the data. To this end, we computed the functional connectivity (graph G) between EEG channels using techniques from various analysis domains, and mined the most representative channels (nodes i). To achieve dimensionality optimization, we propose two centrality measures based on the h-index and degree-strength centrality (DSC) metrics: (1) global ks-index (h<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ks</inf>), and (2) local l<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ks</inf> -index (l<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ks</inf>).

The selected networks and channels were then mined: the former using global topological measures, and the latter using conventional time-series metrics. In the experiments, we varied the number of the most relevant networks and channels, as well as the DSC type, and used five classifiers with repeated k-fold cross-validation. Our best classification accuracy was 60.1%, achieved with one graph, two channels, and an artificial neural network. The results showed that the new indices helped distinguish subtle structural variations between nodes, select the most relevant channels, and surpass the state of the art in the accuracy-channel ratio."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of internet traffic, dominated by heavy media content, poses significant challenges in terms of latency and operational costs for content providers. While Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are the standard solution, their performance heavily relies on internal strategies like cache eviction, where conventional algorithms such as Least Recently Used (LRU) are often suboptimal for dynamic user access patterns. Furthermore, much of the advanced research in CDN optimization is validated solely through simulations, creating a gap between theory and reproducible practical implementations. This paper presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive, multi-regional CDN testbed to bridge this gap. The testbed integrates three main subsystems: a server subsystem using Nginx, a monitoring subsystem with Prometheus and Grafana, and a machine learning subsystem for intelligent cache eviction. As a primary validation of its utility, we used the testbed to conduct a comparative analysis of cache eviction policies. Results show that under a realistic Zipf distribution traffic simulation, the machine learning-based Learning from the Experts (LRB) algorithm achieved an average Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) of 90.15%, significantly outperforming the baseline LRU (85.84%). The main contribution of this work is a functional, measurable, and reproducible testbed that not only validates the superiority of an intelligent caching approach but also provides a platform for future CDN optimization research."

It is shown that, with a fixed SF, an increase in bandwidth has virtually no effect on BER, but leads to an increase in transmission speed. By adapting SF together with BW, the required speed can be achieved while maintaining low BER values. The results obtained allow us to formulate recommendations for selecting modulation parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in conditions of deteriorated electromagnetic environment."

The primary objective of the development is to create a scalable system that supports experiments with a wide range of models (YOLOv8– YOLOv11, DETR, Mask R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, etc.) using interactive analytics, complete logging, and automated report generation. Unlike conventional testing environments, the proposed platform accounts for the characteristics of images from various application domains. For each scenario, log files are automatically stored with key metrics (mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:.95, Precision, Recall, F1-score, IoU) and FPS, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of both accuracy and processing speed. A distinctive practical novelty of the system is the implemented module for studying the impact of video stream preprocessing methods (CLAHE, gamma correction, median filtering, etc.) on object detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated, for example, that in low-visibility conditions the combination of Zero-Dce + gamma correction + CLAHE yielded an increase in mAP@0.5 in the range of 4–6%, depending on the model architecture. The platform also provides tools for assessing the effect of CUDA acceleration on the performance of each model. The developed system has undergone validation in a series of experiments, including tasks of adapting computer vision models within hardware-software complexes for assisting visually impaired individuals under limited computational resources, confirming its efficiency and practical applicability in various applied domains"

Well logs, as structured tabular data, provide rich features for Vs prediction. However, traditional machine learning models struggle to capture the complex coupling among multi-source logs, while deep learning models often require heavy preprocessing and large parameter scales. This study proposes a Vs prediction method based on MambaTab, which embeds well log features and employs a structured state-space model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies along depth and nonlinear relationships among features. Experiments on carbonate and volcanic rock datasets show that MambaTab outperforms benchmark models, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. This method offers a promising framework for geophysical characterization and reservoir prediction in complex geological settings."

The study examines informatics education across multiple levels of the educational system, ranging from primary and secondary education to higher education. Particular emphasis is placed on higher education, especially within teacher preparation programs in computer science, focusing on how prospective educators can effectively integrate modern technologies and tools into their instructional activities, develop students’ digital competencies, and support their ability to solve complex problems. AI is taught as a standalone subject at the master’s level of teacher education in computer science; however, it also serves as a supportive tool that enhances students’ problem-solving skills. Rather than providing ready-made solutions, AI guides students, explains reasoning, and facilitates the development of their own knowledge structures. The paper explores practical applications of AI tools in teaching practice, such as lesson planning and accessing up-to-date information relevant to course content. Within the context of computer science didactics, the authors provide examples of classroom activities involving chatbots and discuss how AI can be effectively utilized by both students and educators in self-directed learning. The paper concludes with a summary of general opportunities and challenges associated with the use of AI in education, supported by the authors’ experiences and recommendations for its effective implementation."

    "abstract": "Text backdoor attacks bring great risks to the secure deployment of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, where attackers usually inject a specific trigger to mislead the model. Various of backdoor triggers have been designed, including visible triggers, e.g., directly adding a specific symbols to the end of the sentence, and invisible triggers, e.g., rewriting sentence structure or style. Generally, the invisible triggers are hard to be peceived by both human readers and backdoor defenders, but they also meet two limitations, i.e., the low training efficiency and low attack success rate. To address these challenges, we propose Unstable Sample based Style Enhancement (USSE) for invisible text backdoor attacks. Specifically, we improve training efficiency by prioritizing unstable samples that are more prone to distributional shifts during training iterations, thereby reducing redundant updates and accelerating model convergence. Furthermore, we enhance attack success rates by introducing a style enhancement score that reinforces the consistency and distinctiveness of trigger-specific stylistic features, making them more easily activated during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets-SST2, OLID, Ling-Spam, and HSOL-demonstrate that USSE improves training efficiency by more than $30 \\%$ compared with random selection methods, while also achieving a $2 \\%$ increase in attack success rate."

Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and exposed to human error due to the large amount of data recorded during tests. This paper proposes a fully automated solution for data processing and evaluation of qualification tests in hydropower units. The user interaction with the software system is mediated by a minimalist and intuitive interface, designed also in Phyton, to logically guide the operator through the analysis configuration steps. The user can define the precise context of the evaluation by selecting essential parameters. The choice of the test type, whether it is a certification procedure designed to validate compliance with standards or a qualification procedure for assessing operational performance, establishes the regulatory framework and purpose of the analysis. Subsequently, the precise specification of the hydropower unit under test ensures full traceability of the results, and the selection of the particular test to be processed, such as the dynamic response to frequency variations or the behavior during operation. The proposed solution reduces manual intervention, accelerates reporting, and improves result accuracy."

Considering the direction control application of dipole electromagnets within particle accelerators, we will primarily be concerned with determining the rotation transformation that is applied by the dipole's field onto the electron beam's direction vector. In order to achieve this, our work involves fundamental concepts of particle physics and electromagnetism, together with a set of magnetic field measurements performed on the device under test. Our beam deflection computations will involve the assumption that the magnetic field generated by the device is directed along a single dimension of our coordinate system. This assumption is only valid if the dipole electromagnet is correctly positioned in the electron beam's path. In an attempt at solving this issue, our testing setup is used to correctly determine the adjustments that may be performed on the dipole's positioning, relative to its intended mechanical configuration, such that the previously mentioned condition holds. This method has the potential of allowing for the usage of electromagnets that are moderately outside specifications, as long as the field generated by them may be considered uniform in a given aperture. In other words, our work may be used to correct orientation errors in dipole electromagnet manufacturing, without increased costs."

As full-wave EM simulation is infeasible for such large-scale MMIMO arrays, the proposed IDM-approach offers an useful time and memoryefficient route for NF analysis, with better accuracy compared to conventional isotropic element based technique. The normalized Poynting vector magnitude and EM Lagrangian density in the NF region are visualized for large-scale ID-based URAs. It is shown that the spatial distribution of normalized EM Lagrangian density plots provide an alternative paradigm as compared to the traditional phase-error criteria to quantify the “Fresnel distance” (boundary between the reactive and radiating NF region) for large-scale MMIMO arrays. The impact of the array-aperture dimension in configuring the distribution of NF reactive energy density is further highlighted through the large-scale ID-URA examples."

To address these, a simplified sizing framework is proposed, defined by two clear criteria: backup capability for critical loads and self-consumption enhancement through energy shifting.This practical, user-oriented method supports the design of PV-coupled storage systems that enhance resilience, cost efficiency, and renewable integration, while contributing to the development of distributed flexibility solutions.Keywords — residential battery storage, energy autonomy, grid flexibility, ancillary services, renewable integration"

Details of the phase estimation algorithm are presented. Besides, architecture and adaptive algorithm of the AAAs weights calculation are presented as well. The algorithm is based on the Linearly Constrained Recursive Least Squares approach. It uses the Matrix Inversion Lemma to invert the AAA input signal correlation matrix, which is used for the calculation of the Kalman gain vector which in turn is used for the calculation of the AAA weights. Simulation results demonstrate 0.5°…4° phase estimation accuracy, if the 3-by-3 AAAs are used, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is –20 dB at the outputs of the AAA channel receivers and the AAAs operate in the presence of 0…8 spatially distributed interfering signals with the Interference-to-Signal Ratio of 90 dB each.

High accuracy of frequency measurement in real electric networks allows for high accuracy of measurement of other electric parameters, which include the root-mean-square value, active power, reactive power, apparent power and a number of electric power quality parameters. One of the most promising measurement methods is the method based on obtaining the signal spectrum and then finding the frequency corresponding to its maximum. The main source of methodical error in this approach is associated with the socalled “spectrum leakage” effect. To eliminate this effect, weighting functions are often used, the effectiveness of which is limited. In this article, a comparative analysis of the applied weighting functions is performed and their effectiveness is estimated. The cases of a rectangular window, a Hanning window and a window with maximum suppression in side lobes are considered for cases of spectrum approximation using three samples. The effectiveness of the approaches is estimated for the case of a sinusoidal signal, a sinusoidal signal distorted by noise and a polyharmonic input signal. Using the Matlab software package, a simulation model was obtained, which allowed us to check the correctness of the obtained analytical expressions and evaluate the effectiveness of the approaches under consideration."

The system was trained on a diverse set of wound images covering different categories such as diabetic ulcers, surgical incisions, and burns, and included variations in skin tones and lighting to ensure wider applicability. Experimental evaluation shows that the U-Net achieved high accuracy (Dice = 0.91, IoU = 0.87, sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.93), exceeding the performance of conventional CNN models by about 12%. The AR module overlays wound contours and potential risk regions directly on the real-time stream, offering clear and immediate visual cues to both patients and medical staff.

A modeling frame-work is described for benchmarking these methods against classical baselines and for integrating quantum simulation into existing toolchains.Results indicate promising acceleration for search/optimization and certain perception and estimation subroutines, while end-to-end gains depend critically on state preparation, oracle construction, error rates, and measurement overhead. Given current hardware and SWaP constraints, immediate onboard deployment is unrealistic; instead, we propose a staged path: near-term offboard/cloud assistance for pre- and post-processing, medium-term hybrid classical–quantum pipelines, and longer-term integration of compact quantum coprocessors as devices mature. The paper concludes with practical guidance on workload selection and evaluation criteria for robots."

Furthermore, it has been a major focus of research in cryptography over the past few decades. The proposed technique for implementing Universal Verifiability in the e-voting system for this research is the Block Ballot method. The Block Ballot method is effective for handling voting requests in electronic voting environments. The system treats every voter’s choice as an exchange that gets aggregated into a poll box, allowing the tally of votes to be monitored through the Block Ballot structure. Anyone can agree on the final count thanks to the Block Ballot’s audit trail, which allows the total number of votes to be confirmed by verifying that no data was altered, removed, or improperly introduced into the block. Based on several simulations, the block ballot method has been successfully used for the purposes of universal verifiability at the e-voting stage. The block ballot method in this study produced a universal verifiability degree of 1, which shows that the block ballot has reached the best universal verifiability degree value compared to other methods."

    "abstract": "Lobster-eye technology utilizing direct X-ray imaging features a wide field of view, high resolution, and exceptional sensitivity, thereby enabling the detection of faint pulsed X-ray signals. This study employs the Monte Carlo method to simulate the pulsed X-ray arrival spectra generated by a 1-kt-yield high-altitude nuclear explosion at burst heights of 40–60 km. Additionally, the ray-tracing method is utilized to model the transmission process and imaging outcomes of pulsed X-rays within the lobster-eye optical system. Through these simulations, the feasibility of the lobster-eye optical system in detecting low-yield and low-burst-height high-altitude nuclear explosions is confirmed. This study broadens the detection range for high-altitude nuclear explosions, offering an innovative technical approach for developing detection technologies targeting low-yield and low-burst-height high-altitude nuclear explosions."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, however, real-world deployments are often constrained by Periodic Deterministic Communication (PDC) schedules, where communication between clients and the central server occurs at fixed intervals due to bandwidth limitations, energy constraints, or regulatory restrictions. These rigid schedules introduce fundamental challenges, including delayed model updates, model drift, inefficient convergence, and heightened sensitivity to non-IID data distributions, which undermine FL performance in practical settings. To address these limitations, we propose Federated Nested Quasi-Newton Optimization (FedNQN), a novel framework that accelerates convergence and enhances FL robustness under PDC constraints. FedNQN integrates curvature-aware central acceleration with variance-controlled local adaptation, ensuring stable learning dynamics despite restricted communication. At the global level, second-order curvature information accelerates model updates, compensating for infrequent synchronization, while local updates leverage variance-controlled optimizations to mitigate drift and adapt to heterogeneous data distributions. This coordinated optimization strategy enhances convergence speed, improves model accuracy, and maintains computational efficiency, making FL more adaptable to real-world constraints. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate FedNQN’s effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of stability, scalability, and resilience to communication inefficiencies."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the quantification of structural uncertainty using evidence theory has been widely adopted. However, there is a long-term difficult problem of overconservative reliability in this field. This article reveals that the “one-vote veto” phenomenon in the mapping mechanism of the focal element's basic probability assignment (BPA) to the reliable domain is the fundamental reason. Thus, the rational mapping of focal element's BPA to the reliable domain is a new problem that has not yet been paid attention to and is in urgent need of a solution. To address this new scientific problem, a “cut-merge” approach for uncertainty quantification inspired by triangular distribution is proposed. Its core idea is “cutting” first and then “merging.” “Cutting” is to construct two extreme probability density functions (PDFs) that obey the triangular distribution on each focal element, and “merging” is to integrate the extreme joint PDF on the reliable domain, to realize the scientific mapping of focal element's BPA. This method eliminates the need for extreme value analysis of focal elements and requires only the computation of two definite integrals to obtain the reliability interval. The results of an artificial synthetic case with a known true distribution of focal elements show that the proposed method is obviously superior to the traditional method in most engineering scenarios. The results of four application examples show that compared with the traditional method, the proposed method reduces the uncertainty interval width by 64.81% on average and increases the smoothness index by 67.01% on average. This work provides a new theoretical tool for structural reliability analysis."

    "abstract": "Radiance field techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance in reconstructing photorealistic real-world scenes. However, a widely recognized limitation of these methods is their reliance on densely captured images for training. Active learning offers a promising solution by selecting the most informative images to capture. An effective measure of data informativeness is the mutual information between the unknown image and the model parameters, known as the expected information gain. Naive estimation of this quantity requires inferring both the model and predictive distributions, which is computationally intractable for high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable method to estimate information gain. Instead of sampling in the high-dimensional model parameter space, we leverage the ray sampling process inherent in volume rendering to approximate the expected information gain. Specifically, we parameterize volume sampling with perturbed ray directions and learn the predictive distribution to infer optimal perturbation patterns. Furthermore, we derive an empirical risk decomposition that demonstrates how our method effectively explores the volume sampling space to enhance diversity, leading to efficient and informative view selection. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality for active learning of radiance fields, outperforming previous methods across various datasets, including both forward-facing and object-centric scenes."

    "abstract": "Sea fog is a frequently occurring and potentially hazardous meteorological phenomenon. To better capture its dynamic characteristics within complex marine environments, this study conducted six cruise observation experiments off the eastern coast of Huangdao Station in Shandong Province by using a millimeter-wave cloud radar operating at a frequency of 94GHz mounted on an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). First, a comparative analysis was performed against the 35-GHz cloud radar installed at Huangdao Station to evaluate their capability in characterizing sea fog. The results showed that both radars were capable of detecting the vertical distribution of sea fog, while the 94GHz millimeter-wave radar exhibited higher sensitivity to capture weak fog particles during in the early stage of fog formation. Subsequently, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to investigate the relationships among key meteorological variables—forward visibility, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed—and radar echo intensity. The analysis revealed a significant interrelationship among these variables, with a path coefficient of 0.72 for their collective influence on radar echo intensity. Radar echo intensity exhibited a significant positive response to relative humidity and a significant negative response to forward visibility (p<0.001). In addition, forward visibility was retrived using both the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results demonstrated that XGBoost achieved substantially higher predictive accuracy, with R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>>0.819.

    "abstract": "We propose and numerically investigate a CMOS-compatible hybrid plasmonic ridge waveguide (HPW)-based TM-pass polarizer that combines a silicon core with an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) slab separated by a silica spacer. The hybrid structure enables strong modal coupling and selective attenuation, allowing the TM mode to propagate efficiently while the TE mode is progressively suppressed through mode hybridization along the coupling region. Comprehensive 2D and 3D finite element analysis confirms the device’s high performance and compactness. With a total footprint of only 7 μm, two optimized models are presented: Model-1 emphasizing ultra-broadband operation, and Model-2 achieving an ultra-high polarization extinction ratio (PER). The broadband model (Model-1) demonstrates PER ≥ 20 dB across 349 nm (1469–1818 nm), PER ≥ 30 dB across 255 nm (1488–1743 nm), and PER ≥ 50 dB across 127 nm (1523–1650 nm), covering the entire C, L, and U telecom bands. The high-PER model (Model-2) attains a record PER of 74.72 dB with a low insertion loss (IL) of 1.36 dB at 1550 nm. The proposed compact and fabrication-friendly designs offer an excellent trade-off among bandwidth, extinction ratio, and loss, making them strong candidates for on-chip polarization management in silicon photonic integrated circuits and broadband optical interconnects."

    "abstract": "In this article, a fault-tolerant architecture (FTA) is presented for the multiuser detector in interleave division multiple access (IDMA). The detector is inherently prone to soft errors, as its chip area is predominantly occupied by memories, which are easily exposed to high-energy particles and hostile interferences in harsh environments. One of the most widespread ways to protect memories is to encode their entries with error-correcting codes (ECCs). However, naïvely encoding all bits in an entry is likely to be costly and unnecessary. Accordingly, to sort out performance-critical bits and determine the priority of protection, we extensively scrutinize how vulnerable respective bits in the memories of the detector are too soft errors. Based on the analysis, in addition, an efficient FTA that selectively encodes only a subset of the bits in order of the identified vulnerability is developed. Furthermore, the proposed FTA implements the state-of-the-art multiuser detection (MUD) scheme called on-the-fly despreading (OD) and showcases a new feature named purification, which repeatedly replaces erroneous entries with corrected ones to keep them error-free. Complicated memory accesses to concurrently perform the OD as well as the purification are enabled by remodeling both the datapath and the control path of the baseline OD architecture (ODA). Implementation results demonstrate that, unlike the prior arts that fail to sustain near-optimal performances and become impractical even for a very low probability of soft error, the proposed FTA may operate robustly in a wide range of harsh conditions without incurring much overhead."

    "abstract": "Direct AC/AC SST is a single-stage solid state transformer (SST) that exhibits high efficiency and power density compared to multi-stage SSTs. The voltage across the HFT terminals is prone to volt-sec unbalance which is undesirable and leads to several critical issues such as DC in HFT magnetizing current, HFT saturation, efficiency reduction and semiconductor switch damage lowering SST reliability. Identifying and analyzing the origin of volt-sec unbalance in direct AC/AC SST is essential for developing strategies for eliminating the same and ensuring reliable SST operation. This paper investigates the volt-sec unbalance problem in direct AC/AC SST and identifies its primary cause as false current commutation for one current polarity in the primary matrix converter. The origin of volt-sec unbalance in direct AC/AC SST, it's effect on SST operation and the hardware issues that lead to it are analyzed in detail with experimental observations. The paper proposes a method for predetermining the sampling instants of HFT primary current and defining the allowable switching regions for primary and secondary converters in a switching cycle to reduce volt-sec unbalance to zero. A set of circuit design guidelines to avoid volt-sec unbalance are also proposed. With the proposed method, the required sampling frequency of HFT primary current is only two times the SST switching frequency. The proposed method is verified on a laboratory prototype. Finally, the paper derives a maximum DC current limit for the HFT of direct AC/AC SST that depends on maximum input voltage, commutation step time, switching frequency and winding resistance."

This paper focuses on path optimization under the simultaneous motion of a “carrier ship–multi-UAV–multiple target vessels” system and develops a time-dependent cooperative planning model. With the objective of minimizing the total monitoring completion time, the model explicitly represents the full cycle of launch–rendezvous–sampling–recovery, incorporating dynamic rendezvous, sampling time windows, and battery-closure constraints, and replaces static Euclidean distances with a dynamic distance matrix. A deep learning–dynamic ant colony optimization fusion algorithm (DL-DACO) is proposed, in which a neural network adaptively tunes key ACO parameters, while the pheromone update rule integrates elite reinforcement, annealed heavy-tailed perturbations, and time-varying evaporation rates to enhance global search capability and reduce the risk of premature convergence. Simulation results show that, compared with a fixed-base monitoring strategy, the proposed dynamic mobile-base strategy reduces the total monitoring time by 17.87%. Furthermore, compared with existing algorithms, the proposed fusion algorithm shortens the total monitoring time by 3.36% and 4.25%, respectively, demonstrating that the developed model and algorithm can substantially improve the efficiency of UAV-based pollutant monitoring and the path-planning capability of shipborne multi-UAV cooperative environmental monitoring."

However, insufficient access control on the clipboard in mobile operating systems exposes its contained data to high risks where one application can read the data, store it locally, or even send it to remote servers. Unfortunately, the literature only has ad-hoc studies in this respect and lacks a comprehensive and systematic study of the entire mobile application ecosystem. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated tool, ClipboardScope+, that leverages the principled static program analysis to uncover the clipboard data usage in mobile applications at scale by defining a usage as a combination of two aspects, i.e., how the clipboard data is validated and where does it go. It defines four primary categories of clipboard data operation, namely spot-on, grand-slam, selective, and cherry-pick, based on the clipboard usage in an application. ClipboardScope+ is evaluated on over <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1.2 million</i> mobile applications available on Google Play, spanning the years 2022 and 2023.

Azimuthal currents were reconstructed from the measured voltage data using an optimization method based on evolutionary strategy. These time-dependent current profiles were then used to compute Lorentz-force-induced stress in a 2D axisymmetric finite element analysis (FEA) model. Results show that inductive coupling during the quench leads to azimuthal current imbalance between adjacent pancake coils, causing bending and high compressive stress at the outer joints. The stress increases with current imbalance and propagates sequentially as the quench advances. A mitigation strategy was discussed by suppressing current imbalance using a magnetic dam."

    "abstract": "Power distribution networks (PDNs) are designed to deliver sufficient and stable power to printed circuit board (PCB) components. With increasing current/voltage demands on modern PCBs, power rails in PDN require more space for metals. Existing design techniques often adopt greedy heuristics to optimize the metal shapes of power rails. However, they consider little spatial competition among different power rails, so routing spaces may be distributed unevenly, causing redundant metal usage, current/voltage violations, and even routing failures in high-current designs. To remedy this problem, we propose a multi-layered PDN design flow to distribute rail spaces according to current/voltage demands appropriately. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the spatial competition issue in PCB power rail routing. Specifically, we generate a multi-layered topology and minimize the metal area and the via usage with mathematical programming. To resolve the overlap regions by rail detouring, we also propose a resistance-aware routing algorithm. Experimental results show that our work significantly outperforms a baseline algorithm extended from the state-of-the-art rail router in the metal area and runtime, achieving respective reductions of 55% and 71%, without any current/voltage violations."

For this reason, we propose a structure sensitive and semantic alignment synergistic enhancement network (S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>ENet) for RSCD. Centered on structure preservation and semantic enhancement as its core design philosophy, the framework aims to precisely identify authentic changes while effectively suppressing background artifacts. Specifically, a hierarchical adaptive frequency-spatial synergistic change focusing module (FSCF) is designed to analyze high-frequency sub-bands of shallow features in the frequency domain, thereby adaptively enhancing edge structures. A learnable denoising mechanism is introduced to suppress high-frequency noise to offset artifacts. The contrastive locking mechanism is fused in the spatial domain to further accurately define the real change area and improve the perception sensitivity and positioning accuracy of structural changes. In addition, a multilayer bidirectional progressive fusion module (MBPF) is proposed to establish a shallow to deep structure guidance and a deep to shallow semantic feedback path, facilitate bidirectional multi-scale information flow, and effectively achieve cross layer feature collaborative modeling and semantic consistent expression. Rigorous evaluations across four widely-recognized change detection datasets (SYSU-CD, CLCD, WHU Building Dataset, and LEVIR-CD) demonstrate that S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>ENet outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Relative to the sub-optimal network, S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>ENet achieves IoU improvements of 1.43%, 2.02%, 0.32% and 0.37% on respective datasets.

    "abstract": "Medical Large Vision-Language Models (MedLVLMs) have been widely adopted for medical report generation. Despite Med-LVLMs producing state-of-the-art performance, they exhibit a bias toward predicting findings as normal, leading to reports that overlook critical abnormalities. Furthermore, these models often fail to provide comprehensive descriptions of radiologically relevant regions necessary for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose Medical Report Generation Agents (MRGAgents), a novel multi-agent framework that fine-tunes specialized agents for different disease categories. By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMICCXR datasets to train disease-specific agents, our MRGAgents generates reports that effectively balance normal and abnormal findings while ensuring a comprehensive description of clinically relevant regions. Our experiments demonstrate that MRGAgents outperformed the state-of-the-art counterparts, improving both report comprehensiveness and diagnostic utility."

In this paper, we present a federated learning framework that integrates cloud-native services specifically from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support secure, scalable, and interoperable training across client environments. This approach utilizes serverless components such as AWS Lambda, SageMaker, and Step Functions for orchestration, and we introduce a federated API standard designed to coordinate training across multiple cloud providers. This paper address key challenges such as client heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions, and cross-cloud synchronization. Initial architectural validation and experimental planning suggest that this framework can efficiently scale FL workloads without vendor lock-in. We anticipate that this federated API design can simplify multi-cloud collaborations and accelerate privacy-preserving AI development in critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and industrial IoT."

ResNet50 is applied on both annotated and unannotated images to compare how the performance of the model changes when annotations are added to the images. For this purpose, we have taken the dataset from Roboflow consisting of 3461 dragon fruit images. We extracted an unannotated dragon fruit image dataset from Roboflow platform and added annotations to it. Among the deep learning models on annotated images, ResNet50 obtained the highest accuracy of 97.30% while YOLOv5 achieved an accuracy of 95.40%. On the other hand on unannotated images VGG 16 obtained the highest accuracy of 91.10% leaving behind ResNet50 with the accuracy of 63.13%. Deep learning algorithms with image annotation and without image annotation into the field of farming experiment only done for dragon fruit images. In agriculture domain image annotation is used for various tasks like crop detection, crop health monitoring, and livestock management etc. Image annotation is the image labeling technique. This technique is more specific to recognize the different objects to machines using artificial Intelligence algorithms. Computer vision based AI systems are trained with annotated images which help the agriculture field be more productive and proficient in various tasks."

We present the first systematic study of how such defenses impact group fairness in DFL, evaluating six state-of-the-art methods across three vision datasets under varied attacks and graph topologies. Our results show all robust methods consistently degrade fairness relative to weighted averaging, even without attacks, with degradation worsening under sophisticated attacks like ALIE and DISSENSUS. However, not all defenses degrade fairness equally. We identify the root cause as a fundamental misalignment between outlier-detection mechanisms and fairness objectives, where defenses treat statistical deviation as adversarial, inadvertently penalizing minority client updates. These findings have critical implications for DFL deployment in fairness-sensitive domains, underscoring the need for fairness-aware Byzantine defenses that can distinguish between malicious and underrepresented statistical patterns."

Taking Principles of Communication teaching videos as the research object, the framework uses YOLOv8 to calculate group indicators (e.g., students’ up-looking rate, listening rate), adopts deep learning to identify micro-expressions (capturing individual cognitive changes), and constructs a Transformer-based temporal feature fusion network to integrate multimodal behavioral data. Its core innovation lies in mapping fine-grained temporal behavioral patterns to difficulty levels, enabling the framework to distinguish students’ group cognitive states corresponding to teaching segments and map them to “easy”, “medium”, “difficult” levels. Results show the automatically annotated difficulty has a significant statistical correlation with students’ after-class questionnaires and expert evaluations (Spearman’s coefficient $\\mathbf{\\gt 0 . 7}$). This research provides a new technical means for objective, efficient teaching quality monitoring and a reliable empirical basis for personalized teaching improvement and teachers’ professional development."

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with purely textual data has achieved notable progress, yet extending such reasoning to multimodal tasks that integrate both images and text presents significant challenges. Existing approaches, such as large-scale fine-tuning and context-based learning, often demand vast annotated data and computational resources, while still exhibiting randomness and hallucination in single-step inference. Although prior work in multimodal classification has demonstrated the value of combining visual and textual features, the need for structured and reliable reasoning across different modalities remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose VeriCoT, a framework that integrates majority voting with fine-grained verification of differences, thereby enhancing the robustness and precision of multimodal reasoning. By modeling multiple reasoning chains and systematically contrasting their outputs, VeriCoT mitigates errors arising from isolated predictions and improves overall reliability. Experiments on the ScienceQA and MathVista benchmarks show that VeriCoT consistently outperforms baseline models by reducing inference errors and increasing accuracy, particularly in tasks that require complex reasoning over textual and visual information. In particular, applying VeriCoT to the Gemini model raises its accuracy from 87% to 89.6% on MathVista and from 93.4% to 94.8% on ScienceQA. These results highlight the importance of diversity in reasoning processes and underscore verification as a critical step in advancing multimodal CoT methods."

This study provides an integrative literature review of AI applications in workplace practices and employee attitudes, with particular focus on generational differences among Generation $X, Y$ and Z. For the time being, academic researchers have barely analyzed generational differences at work, in relation to AI, and when they have, the target group consists only of university students. Based on the results, it appears that research is still in its very early stages, and university students are currently the primary focus of academic research, presumably because they are easier to involve. There is already more generalist research, in which case the research sample population is general and does not analyze the extent to which the behavior of each generation is similar or different in relation to the factors examined. However, it is clear that Generation Z receives special attention, even though Generations Y and X are likely to face more challenges in terms of technological change and AI acceptance, as they have different psychometric and habitus characteristics than the members of Generation Z, who are “overpowered” and proficient in new technologies. Even though successful AI transformation from a managerial perspective is not only a technological but a human-strategic issue: mobilizing synergies between generations and creating an inclusive organizational culture is essential for ensuring long-term competitive advantage and better employee well-being. In sum, there is a significant market gap that has yet to be filled, so further research on this topic is warranted."

    "abstract": "Turnovers in ice hockey create a short-lived but highly critical window of vulnerability, where the probability of conceding a goal increases sharply within the first 10 seconds. This paper develops a rigorous mathematical optimization framework to determine how and when a team should apply a tactical strategy switch and/or lineup adjustment to minimize goal concession risk in this window. The proposed approach formalizes the game state as a hybrid system with discrete modes representing strategy-lineup pairs and continuous dynamics describing player motion and puck transitions. Switching decisions are constrained by substitution latencies, bench geometry, and coverage feasibility, and are evaluated through a multi-objective cost functional balancing hazard reduction, player effort, and switching penalties. Novel contributions include (1) a criticality index for early-warning detection of high-risk states, (2) latencyaware substitution models that capture transient substitution risks, and (3) receding-horizon optimization policies for operational deployment. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates how micro-substitutions and role-specific strategy shifts can reduce concession hazard without violating feasibility constraints. The results provide a mathematically grounded decision-support framework for coaches and analysts, bridging applied mathematics, informatics, and performance sports to improve defensive resilience in high-tempo, turnover-driven scenarios."

The first yield gap case study in Australia was published in 2012 and led to a range of crop-specific Australian yield gap assessments (see https://yieldgapaustralia.com.au) as well as assessments of yield gap of crop rotations. An important limitation of previous efforts in this space has been our reliance on sub-national level crop production statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to infer crop yields achieved by farmers. Industry experts commonly argue that these yield values are significantly lower than field-scale yields and hence contribute to overestimating the Yield Gap. Here we present a method to downscale regional wheat, barley and canola yields into <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.1 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex> pixels using long term NDVI and EVI signals, and our efforts to ensure these downscaled values are representative of field-scale yields and therefore useful in situations where field-scale yields are not available. Our work is the first to investigate these concerns around sub-national yield statistics and to provide a way to make them more useful for applications relying on real-world estimates of productivity such as Yield Gap assessment and diagnosing."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a fully unsupervised testtime adaptation (TTA) strategy for robust deployment of autonomous systems in land cover mapping, addressing the challenge of domain shifts without relying on labeled target data. The proposed approach leverages entropy minimization and feature modulation to enable models to autonomously adapt to unseen target domains, characterized by variations in environmental factors, sensor properties, or data distributions. By generating and refining pseudo-labels during inference, the system achieves self-correcting capabilities, enhancing its autonomy and reducing reliance on human intervention. This is particularly valuable in resource-scarce regions, where acquiring labeled data is costly and time-consuming, yet accurate land cover maps are crucial for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and urban planning. The method is validated using Sentinel-2 imagery, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 9.3 % across diverse regions in Algeria. This scalable solution not only improves model robustness but also addresses socio-economic needs by enabling large-scale, cost-effective land cover mapping in underresourced areas. From an Earth observation perspective, this work is novel as it extends TTA to complex remote sensing applications, offering a fully unsupervised framework that operates without source or target labels. By combining entropy minimization, pseudo-label refinement, and feature modulation, the approach sets a new standard for autonomous systems in remote sensing, ensuring consistent performance in dynamic environments and contributing to sustainable development goals."

In contrast, infrared (IR) imaging simplifies this process, as fire captured by an IR camera displays a distinct pattern. This allows for more effective monitoring, detection, processing, and authentication of the images. The system is comprised of four primary components: image capture, software/hardware interface, image processing engine, and alarm module. The hardware module was implemented using the Vivado HLS Design Suite and targeted to the ZYNQ XC7Z020 SoC platform. The design efficiently utilizes FPGA resources, consuming less than 12% of Slice LUTs, 2% of memory LUTs, 5% of Slice registers, 8% of DSP blocks, and 4% of block RAMs. Implementation results demonstrate the system's inherent flame detection capabilities, effectively distinguishing hot flames from the surrounding environment."

To address these challenges, this study proposes Spectral and Spatial-Spectral transformer models that reconstructs hyperspectral data from multispectral inputs. The models in this paper are pretrained on EnMAP and EMIT datasets and fine-tuned on spatiotemporally aligned (Sentinel-2, EnMAP) and (HLS-S30, EMIT) image pairs respectively. Our model has the potential to enhance atmospheric monitoring by combining the strengths of hyperspectral and multispectral imaging systems."

    "abstract": "With the continuous advancement of affective computing and human-computer interaction technologies, multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has gradually become a research hotspot due to its superior ability to understand human emotions. By integrating information from multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio, it enables a more comprehensive perception and recognition of emotions from multiple dimensions. To address the limitations of current multimodal feature selection methods in terms of accuracy and correlation modeling, this paper proposes a novel method called Multi $L_{0}$ Deep Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (Multi $L_{0}$-DTCCA), which combines sparse feature selection with nonlinear correlation learning for multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, the method employs the $l_{0}$ norms to select features within each modality, effectively eliminating redundant information, and leverages Deep Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (DTCCA) to enhance the nonlinear correlations across modalities, thereby improving the quality of the fused representation. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi $L_{0}$-DTCCA significantly outperforms several mainstream correlation analysis-based methods in terms of classification accuracy and result stability, verifying its effectiveness in multimodal feature selection and emotion recognition tasks."

The model first employs deep learning methods to extract key events and their causal relationships from unstructured text data generated by students on platforms such as university BBS forums, social media groups and online games. This process constructs individual event-reasoning graphs that reflect the evolutionary paths of students' ideological dynamics. Subsequently, leveraging the structural features of the graph, a quantitative assessment algorithm for ideological states is designed to achieve precise identification of potential ideological issues. Finally, the paper introduces a guidance strategy generation framework based on graph path planning, aiming to provide educators with personalized and executable intervention strategies. Experimental results on a dedicated dataset show that, compared to several baseline models including powerful pre-trained language models, the PIGM-ERG model demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, recall, and F1-score for identifying ideological problems. Furthermore, case studies and expert evaluations have validated the model's interpretability and the reasonableness of the generated guidance strategies, proving the application potential of event-reasoning graphs in profoundly understanding and guiding student ideological dynamics."

Results show that COSMIC-2 exhibits strong agreement near the F2 peak, with discrepancies increasing below 100 km due to overestimations during daytime and underestimations at night. Seasonal analysis reveals improved agreement during winter, while summer shows significant discrepancies driven by heightened ionospheric activity. The findings highlight COSMIC-2's limitations in resolving lower-altitude electron density structures and emphasize the need for refined retrieval algorithms."

Apart from detailing key theories, the study aims to identify the factors influencing the development of subsidiaries by examining the relevant literature and then proposes a framework by classifying these into three dimensions. The proposed framework highlights that the drivers and most decisive actors of role development will be subsidiary managers who have an influence on the development of all three dimensions, thereby placing research on subsidiary role development in a new perspective."

    "abstract": "Home healthcare service routing optimization has become a critical issue in modern healthcare systems as the demand for efficient and patient-centered care continues to grow. This problem involves designing optimal visitation routes for healthcare staff under multiple operational constraints, with the dual objectives of minimizing service costs and maximizing patient satisfaction. However, most existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches primarily address single-objective problems and often struggle to balance conflicting goals in multi-objective scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a Weight-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (WADRL) framework for multi-depot home healthcare routing optimization. The proposed approach integrates a Transformer-based pointer network with a weight-aware modulation mechanism, enabling adaptive policy learning under varying optimization preferences. Furthermore, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) procedure is incorporated to refine DRL-generated solutions, enhancing both the quality and diversity of the Pareto front. Experimental evaluations on extended benchmark datasets demonstrate that the WADRL framework significantly outperforms classical multi-objective optimization algorithms, including NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D, in terms of solution quality, convergence, and robustness, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in intelligent home healthcare scheduling systems."

The created structure of the catalytic layer significantly increases the active surface area of the catalyst, which significantly accelerates electrochemical processes at the three-phase boundary (TPB) of the reaction zone in the SOFC, and this, as a result, significantly increases the power and service life of the created SOFC.

Traditional approaches, including exact and heuristic methods, often struggle with large problem instances due to their high computational complexity. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have emerged as an effective metaheuristic for solving TSP, but their performance can be further enhanced using parallelization techniques. This paper presents a Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) framework for solving TSP by leveraging distributed and multi-threaded computing architectures. The proposed approach implements parallelism at different levels, including population distribution, fitness evaluation, and genetic operations, to accelerate convergence and improve solution quality. We analyse the impact of various parallelization strategies on performance metrics such as execution time, scalability, and solution accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PGA significantly outperforms traditional sequential GAs, achieving faster convergence and better route optimization. Additionally, we explore the tradeoffs between computational efficiency and solution optimality across different parallel execution models. The findings highlight the effectiveness of parallel genetic algorithms in tackling large-scale TSP instances and provide insights into designing efficient evolutionary algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems."

    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is an innovative information-centric networking paradigm that transitions communication from host-to-host to content-centric interactions. Nonetheless, its stateful forwarding plane— especially the Pending Interest Table (PIT)—presents new security vulnerabilities, most prominently the Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). In an IFA, assailants overwhelm routers with unsolicited interest packets, depleting PIT resources and impairing the performance of legitimate traffic. This study investigates the real-world impacts of IFA through a practical testbed. We found a significant reduction in performance as a result of an IFA attack. We also found that the negative consequences for IFA are very localized: only the routers along the attack path saw steep increases in PIT entries, nInInterest, nOutInterest, nInData, and nOutData, and all other nodes were largely unaffected. This localized pressure—only to routers that forward or terminate malicious Interests— suggests that IFA does not create congestion across the entire network. These results support the use of mitigation actions that do not have to be applied network-wide. In other words, it is possible to target vulnerability points such as edge or core forwarding nodes without responding across the entire network topology. Ultimately, our work contributes to an understanding of the subtle implications of IFA on NDN performance and informs the design of effective, adaptive defenses."

This research envisages an inventive 5G friendly remote sensing technique that combines edgeAI, digital twins, and blockchain to empower and maintain that a kinetic infrastructure is being well attended to. The ultra-low latency 5G networks are used coupled with ultra high resolution sensor information to feed to an edge computing AI system for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance in real time. The digital twin model forms a virtual twin of the infrastructure assets to simulate structural degradation with AI-driven simulations and to optimize the maintenance schedule. Blockchain technology is employed to ensure data security and integrity and to create a tamper-proof distributed ledger for sensor data. To make the monitoring more accurate, the proposed system combines multiple sensors, i.e., LiDAR, thermal imaging, IoT sensors, and drone surveillance. The framework is tailored for critical infrastructure such as bridges, highways, railways, power grids, and smart buildings and enhances maintenance efficiency, decreases operational cost, and decreases failure risk. This shows through experimental results that conventional monitoring systems are not capable of achieving improved anomaly detection accuracy, lesser latency, and enhanced data security, as is the case with this new system. Through this, the research helps in developing the resilient, AI-powered, and secure infrastructure management solutions for making intelligent urban ecosystems and leveraging 5G connectivity for real-time, predictive, and autonomous infrastructure monitoring."

The diversity of the problems faced during system integration is huge; some of the typical problems include packet loss within a sub-system, packet loss between multiple sub-systems, reception of variable length garbage data leading to dwell discard, difficulty of simultaneous parallel links validation at input and output due to unequal packet lengths because of difference in Packetization logic involving multiple protocols, etc to name a few.

This framework synergistically integrates CNN’s local feature extraction capabilities with Transformer’s global connectivity while establishing a multi-dimensional attention synergy mechanism.

    "abstract": "Optimization and automation of facility layout problems (FLPs) is a critical step for developing layouts in many industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, where layouts have significant impact on the material handling costs (MHC) and overall operational efficiency. Industrial FLPs often involve complex shaped components, continuous design spaces, and multi-floor layouts, presenting challenges that are difficult to handle for traditional approaches. To address these challenges, this paper presents a mulit-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm for optimizing unequal area facility layout problems (UAFLPs) in 3D space. The approach is proposed both in a centralized training centralized execution (CTCE) and centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) setting. Three experiments with increasing complexity are executed to asses the performance of the MATD3 approach and to benchmark it with a single-agent TD3 approach. The results demonstrate that the MATD3 in a CTCE setting consistently performs better than in a CTDE setting and the single-agent TD3 across all experiments. It develops superior layouts regarding MHS and shows more stable learning compared to the other approaches, especially with increased problem complexity. These results highlight the potential of utilizing MADRL to develop facility layouts in real-world environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a privacy-preserving AI-based voice assistant designed to operate seamlessly in both online and offline modes, with the ability to switch dynamically between them. In the online mode, the system employs OpenAI’s GPT models for language understanding and Google’s speech APIs for speech processing. In offline mode, it integrates Whisper for speech-to-text (STT), Coqui for text-to-speech (TTS), and a locally hosted large language model (LLM) using Ollama, ensuring that all processing occurs locally to safeguard user data. To enhance knowledge retrieval in offline mode, Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented using locally stored document embeddings. A graphical user interface (GUI) provides clear visual feedback and allows users to switch modes effortlessly. The modular, dual-mode architecture offers a balance between usability, accessibility, and privacy, making it suitable for applications in education, research, and professional domains. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the system delivers accurate, contextually relevant responses with low latency while maintaining strong privacy guarantees."

    "abstract": "In electric railway traction systems with asynchronous motors and rotor field-oriented control, the motor control is achieved by means of a four-quadrant converter (PWM step-up rectifier) and a voltage inverter. Under these conditions, the supply voltage and the current through the motor are distorted, and the motor load capacity decreases. Consequently, a specific phenomenon that may occur is the loss of capacity assuring prescribed torque followed by the improper operation of the entire system. The paper investigates this phenomenon and identifies a solution."

    "abstract": "Motorcycle noise is one of the dominant sources of urban sound pollution, posing risks to environmental comfort and public health. Conventional measurement using sound level meters is often inefficient for large-scale or longterm monitoring. To address this challenge, this study presents an automated motorcycle noise detection system that integrates Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. The dataset consists of 598 audio samples: 537 secondary data from Kaggle and 61 primary field recordings from real motorcycles under idle and constant gas conditions. MFCC was applied to convert raw audio signals into representative spectral features, which were then processed by a CNN to learn noise patterns effectively. The best CNN configuration (RMSprop optimizer with Uniform kernel and 80:20 data ratio) achieved 91.19% accuracy, with an F1-score of 0.82 for the noisy class. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining MFCC and CNN for real-time noise monitoring, offering a practical tool to support policymakers and environmental stakeholders in regulating vehicle noise emissions."

    "abstract": "The minimum-cost maximum-flow problem is a fundamental challenge in network optimization, with applications spanning logistics, telecommunications, and resource allocation. Traditional models assume precise arc capacities—an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios where parameters are uncertain. This article addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach to solving the minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in which arc capacities are represented as intervals, thereby accounting for data uncertainty directly within the database layer.The proposed method is implemented at the level of the PostgreSQL DBMS, leveraging its extensibility through SQL and the procedural language PL/pgSQL. The solution models the network as a database table and formulates the interval-valued problem. By exploiting PostgreSQL’s advanced features, including user-defined functions, an algorithm was developed that computes the robust maximum flow and subsequently determines its minimum cost, providing a guaranteed solution for all capacity realizations within the specified intervals.The article demonstrates that complex combinatorial optimization under uncertainty can be efficiently integrated directly into a relational database management system. The in-database implementation eliminates the need for data transfer to external application programs, enhances scalability for large network graphs, and provides a practical, robust decision-making tool for data-driven applications. Experiments on artificially generated networks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method."

This dual-model approach allows comparative evaluation and enhances system robustness, providing flexibility between faster inference and higher accuracy according to computational constraints and environmental conditions. The models achieved top-1 accuracies of 88.89% and 94.72%, respectively, and showed reliable real-time translation performance.

Voltage measurements can be conducted using a peak voltmeter or a digital recorder. During this type of test, recording the exact time of chopping (the time when disruptive discharges occur) is not necessary. However, this study aims to identify patterns in the behavior of different rated voltage insulator strings when tested with lightning impulse voltage, recording not only the peak value but also the time to chopping. It also seeks to determine the “disruptive effect,” as defined in the equal areas theory, which allows for the evaluation of disruptive voltage for impulse wave shapes that differ from standardized ones, based on the insulator's behavior during the up-and-down test under standardized lightning impulse voltage."

Experiments were conducted with three, four, and five epochs to analyze performance variations. Results show that training for four epochs consistently produced the best performance, achieving a Macro-F1 of 0.472, Micro-F1 of 0.634, and Average Precision of 0.662, while reducing Hamming Loss to 0.079. Extending training to five epochs led to a slight decline across most metrics, suggesting the onset of overfitting. At the label level, minority-class performance improved at four epochs but degraded at five, indicating a trade-off between overall effectiveness and fairness in representation. These findings highlight that epoch selection is a critical yet often overlooked factor in multi-label emotion classification. The study provides practical guidance for selecting epoch budgets to balance accuracy and fairness in imbalanced datasets."

It utilizes YOLO and DeepSORT techniques for object detection and tracking, and HRNet for human keypoint extraction. The skeleton stream employs ST-GCN/CTR-GCN techniques to represent spatiotemporal structure, while the RGB stream employs TimeSformer and VideoMAE techniques to capture visual semantics. Finally, a multimodal feature set is constructed through fusion, and Cross-Attention is leveraged to achieve multi-label classification, user engagement prediction, and security event identification across multiple task levels. The experiments use the SAV dataset released in 2024. Experimental analysis demonstrates that multimodal fusion significantly outperforms single-stream models in various classroom scenarios, with particularly significant improvements in robustness in experimental exploratory classrooms. In-depth ablation experiments, error case analysis, and teaching application testing demonstrate that the model achieves significant improvements in recognition accuracy and generalization, effectively assisting in teaching evaluation, process monitoring, and safety warnings. The introduction of deep learning technology into learning behavior analysis in physics classrooms provides a new quantitative tool for educational decision-making."

    "abstract": "The growth of weeds in cotton fields leads to significant crop yield losses, with increased weed growth occurring in areas between cotton plants. To manage this, it is crucial to classify the weeds to identify their presence and deploy automated machinery for removal. While Deep Learning techniques have been widely used for classification tasks, they come with the drawbacks of high energy consumption and substantial memory usage. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks have gained attention in image processing because of their compatibility with low-power neuromorphic hardware. This paper evaluates the performance of a Spiking Neural Network using the Integrate and Fire Neuron model to classify weeds in cotton fields. To increase computational efficiency, bilinear interpolation is employed during data preprocessing. A Pytorch-based library, Sinabs is used to convert a Convolutional Neural Network to a Spiking Neural Network. Three classes of cotton weed images from a publicly available source are used, and the results are presented in terms of accuracy, training time and neuron spiking output for sample images. The loss value for the network is 1.78. The accuracy values obtained for 3 classes of weeds are $84.47 \\%$ for Convolutional Neural Network and $\\mathbf{8 3. 3 4 \\%}$ for converted Spiking Neural Network."

    "abstract": "Starting from a basic antenna designed to operate at 2.4 GHz, this paper investigates systematic optimization of its geometry to enhance performance. After exploring shape modifications aimed at increasing either bandwidth or the gain of a single element, the optimized structure is employed to form antenna arrays that maintain the same bandwidth while achieving higher gain. Various array configurations and element spacings are examined to assess their influence on radiation characteristics. The results indicate that reducing the interelement distance improves the overall gain of the array. Corner rounding (filleting) has negligible impact on the S-parameters or gain, whereas chamfering the corners shifts the resonance to a higher frequency and reduces radiation efficiency. Three different spacings were considered between the antennas and for each of them chamfering and fillet were varied. Overall, the study demonstrates that arraying elements effectively increases antenna gain, in our case from 1.14 dB for an antenna to 4.57 dB for four antennas in an array, but careful consideration of the array's physical dimensions is essential. The principal contribution is demonstrating that the interaction between patchcorner geometry and inter-element spacing can be exploited to optimize array performance."

    "abstract": "Split Federated Learning (SFL) is a distributed machine learning framework where the models are split and trained on the server and clients. However, data heterogeneity and partial client participation result in label distribution skew, which severely degrades learning performance. To address this issue, we propose SFL with Concatenated Activations and Logit Adjustments (SCALA), in which activations from client-side models are concatenated as the input of the server-side model to centrally adjust label distribution across different clients, and logit adjustments in the loss functions of both server-side and client-side models are performed to deal with the label distribution variation across different subsets of participating clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the concatenation of activations reduces the impact of data heterogeneity, while logit adjustments in loss functions enhance the recognition of low-frequency labels at the cost of sacrificing the recognition of high-frequency labels."

It minimizes deviations from a target vehicle configuration while enforcing bounds on the expected values of quadratic constraints including states and controls, and fulfilling balance equations constraints. The problem uses a recent Linear-Quadratic (LQ) framework with stochastic quadratic constraints. Validation via two case studies shows that the method, despite disruptions, maintains proximity to references and satisfies all constraints, outperforming a traditional LQ controller and a heuristic controller, both of which lack the stochastic constraints. Furthermore, offline verification checks the covariance matrices' asymptotic limits to guarantee bound compliance."

However, in complex application scenarios such as target camouflage recognition, interference countermeasures, component-level feature extraction, and feature database construction, target recognition models face several challenges. These include coarse feature extraction, unclear decision-making rationales, weak adversarial robustness, and unreliable prediction results. These limitations pose a significant bottleneck to the stable transfer of intelligent models in noncooperative and non-open source environments. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Artificial intelligence (AI)-based target recognition represents a crucial component of intelligent remote sensing image explanation. In the field of target information perception for high-resolution spaceborne remote sensing images, there is an urgent demand for trustworthy intelligent recognition under complex adversarial conditions. In this article, we propose a new paradigm for trustworthy intelligent perception based on spaceborne detection. Specifically, we analyze the competitive mechanisms among decision-making factors within the feature space under adversarial conditions, enabling the extraction of target-invariant features and the integration of feature explainability with adversarial robustness. Finally, our approach aims to enhance the adaptability and reliability of the target perception models.</p> <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">This article first introduces our motivation, highlighting the reasons behind the uncertainty of current spaceborne intelligent perception capabilities under noncooperative conditions, which form the foundation for exploring trustworthy perception. Next, the article explains the three key components of trustworthy intelligence: feature invariance, feature explainability, and feature robustness. Then, based on cooperative game theory, we propose a trustworthy perception method that integrates these three elements, suggesting several feasible technical approaches along with reasonable analysis and expected results. Finally, the article concludes by summarizing the work and emphasizing the necessity and practical significance of spaceborne trustworthy intelligent perception.</p>"

    "abstract": "As corporate social responsibility (CSR) gains prominence, firms confront a strategic choice between symbolic CSR, which offers superficial signals and entails greenwashing risk, and substantive CSR, which eliminates this risk through genuine and impactful practices at a higher cost. Prior research primarily examined whether firms engage in CSR, with limited exploration on the choice between symbolic and substantive CSR once engagement is decided. This paper develops a game-theoretic model to examine firms' incentives for substantive CSR, and how these varies with market structures and relevant exogenous parameters, including price premium, greenwashing risk, and consumer boycotts. We find that firms implement substantive CSR only when the incremental marginal cost is sufficiently low, and this condition becomes more stringent under competition. Although competition discourages the adoption of substantive CSR, it increases consumer surplus and social welfare when substantive CSR is implemented. Counterintuitively, our paper demonstrates that price premium and consumer boycotts do not always promote substantive CSR under competition due to strategic price interactions. Furthermore, we derive the equilibrium CSR strategy structure and identify a dynamic set of the equilibrium structures that always includes the symmetric structures. Interestingly, a prisoner's dilemma, in which both firms implement Pareto-insufficient symbolic CSR, may arise when the set consists solely of the symmetric structures. Finally, we show that these results remain robust under model extensions and demonstrate that the presence of consumers who refuse to pay a price premium may surprisingly increase firms' prices and profits."

In this paper, we address the question of how to modify, during execution, the desired behavior while maintaining guarantees on the behavior, if possible; we define three types of modification: changing the maximum number of robots in a region of the workspace, changing the connectivity of the workspace, and redistributing robots. During execution, if the specification is modified, we update the controller by creating local patches. Given the starting and ending state of the patch, we jointly use a symbolic synthesis tool and a constraint programming solver to synthesize robot control. We demonstrate our approach in simulation."

    "abstract": "Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community."

A model-based theoretical framework is subsequently established, accompanied by a rigorous convergence proof for the modified iteration process. Subsequently, a data-driven version of bias-Lyapunov iteration is developed to learn an optimal control for Markovian jump linear systems with completely unknown dynamics. Simulation examples validate the efficacy and advantage of the proposed bias-Lyapunov iteration method."

In this study, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Fuzzy logic controller are proposed to tune the parameters of controller. The objective of these methods is to optimally tune the parameters of PID controller towards global minimum of tracking errors. Using the Root Mean Square of Error (RMSE) as the metric of evaluation, the numerical results showed that the Fuzzy PID controller with WOA optimized parameters by 77.3% on the xaxis and 66.7% on the z-axis as compared to the other implemented methods."

Despite these advances, the robustness of VLMs against adversarial attacks, particularly in surgical scene understanding via Visual Question Answering (VQA), is not well understood. These models are integral to surgical accuracy but may be vulnerable to data perturbations that can compromise patient outcomes. This paper introduces RoboSurg, a framework designed to protect VLMs against such adversarial threats in surgical environments. We tailor adversarial attacks to the surgical domain, exposing significant vulnerabilities in widely used models such as SurgicalGPT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and CLIP-ViL. RoboSurg incorporates multimodal adversarial training, advanced input preprocessing, and targeted architectural modifications to enhance the strength of these models. Our experimental results demonstrate that RoboSurg effectively lowers the impact of adversarial threats while maintaining model performance under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, the first study of adversarial attacks on VLMs in a surgical context is presented in this paper, and bringing AI solutions to the forefront of safety and reliability marks a significant achievement."

    "abstract": "In the field of personalized footwear and orthopedic sole manufacturing, acquiring accurate lower limb measurements is essential. While numerous image-based techniques—such as OpenCV with a reference object—have been explored for capturing foot dimensions, these methods often suffer from limitations including occlusion, perspective distortion, and missing or inaccurate parameters. To address these challenges, this study introduces an optimized predictive pipeline using the Gradient Boost algorithm to estimate foot length and horizontal breadth with accuracy. Unlike traditional predictive models that rely on generalized features such as BMI, gender, height, or weight, our model leverages refined anthropometric parameters from the ANSUR II dataset to achieve higher accuracy. The predicted values are used to generate a 2D outline of the sole, which is then converted into G-code compatible with CNC machines for contactless, precision-cut insole manufacturing. This approach significantly streamlines the production of custom orthopedic soles, offering scalable, non-invasive, and clinically relevant solutions for individualized foot care. Accurate determination of foot dimensions is critical to diagnosing and treating flat feet, diabetic foot ulcers, plantar fasciitis, and limb-length disparities. Traditional casting and manual mensuration methods are slow, error-prone, and rely on clinical judgment and skill, and commercial image-based solutions are commonly marred by imprecision due to occlusions and perspective distortions. The new Gradient Boost predictive pipeline offers a non-invasive, rapid, and accurate alternative by predicting horizontal breadth and foot length from anthropometric inputs. With automatic generation of CNC-compatible G-code from predicted mensuration, the system enables rapid production of customized orthopedic soles and insoles with minimal manual intervention. This elevates patient comfort, reduces risk of pressure-related injuries and damage, and enhances mobility outcomes, especially among diabetic, geriatric populations, and post-surgical individuals. The solution is interoperable with modern telemedicine and digital orthotics workflows and enables scalable deployment within rehab units, home-based environments, and hospital settings."

In the digital era, social media platforms like X provide abundant text data that can be leveraged to analyze public sentiment toward flood-related events. This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of the IndoBERT model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for sentiment classification on flood-related tweets in Indonesia. The analysis involves three different feature representation techniques Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word2Vec embeddings for contextual representation. Additionally, the impact of Chi- Square feature selection on classification accuracy is examined. The dataset consists of 1080 Indonesian-language tweets collected through a crawling process and labeled automatically using a pretrained sentiment classification model. Results indicate that sentiment in the dataset is dominated by the negative class (62.7%), reflecting public concern and criticism toward flood management efforts. SVM+TF-IDF achieved the highest score for accuracy about 92.35% without feature selection and 0.92 for the evaluation matric, while IndoBERT also demonstrated strong performance on the same dataset compared to Word2Vec and after Chi-Square feature selection. These findings suggest that frequency-based features remain effective for short-text sentiment tasks using SVM, while contextual embeddings from models like IndoBERT offer promising complementary approaches."

The model introduces a PASP-Path for small-object awareness, integrating Parallel Patch Attention (PPA) and Spatially Preserving Convolution (SPD-Conv) to enhance perception of small targets and critical local regions. The original detection head is replaced with a Detect_MBConv module, which combines inverted residual blocks and SE attention to significantly reduce computation and model size. Finally, the PIoU_v2 loss function is employed, incorporating geometric penalties and a non-monotonic attention mechanism to improve localization accuracy and convergence stability for medium-quality samples. Experimental results on a custom student behavior dataset show that PSM-YOLO achieves 87.9% mAP@50 while maintaining a compact model size of only 4.1 MB, striking a balance between accuracy and lightweight design suitable for embedded edge deployment. This study offers a practical algorithmic framework for small-object modeling and trustworthy deployment in smart education systems, with broad applicability in embedded AI, edge computing, and intelligent educational environments."

However, evaluating the quality of chatbot responses, particularly when underlying document sets evolve over time, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate methods for assessing changes in RAG-generated answers before and after an update of the underlying knowledge base. We construct a dataset of paired responses (baseline vs. updated) and explore a spectrum of evaluation strategies: from modern LLM-based judgments to lightweight small language models (SLMs) and classical pre-trained architectures such as BERT. Our study focuses on the central question: Is the updated response better, worse, or equivalent compared to the baseline? We report experimental results across different models, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and biases in automated comparative evaluation. The findings provide insights into practical approaches for response quality assessment in evolving RAG systems, offering a foundation for more robust and scalable evaluation pipelines in real-world applications."

This paper presents an agent-based simulation framework to investigate the interplay between team composition, resource limits, and behavioral thresholds in asymmetric UAV swarm engagements. The simulation features two opposing teams: a blue team employing Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for reconnaissance and Brown-Robinson game theory for specialized hunter drone tasking, and a red team utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for adaptive roster selection and spawn positioning, coupled with a rule-based tactical decision module. We specifically analyze the impact of three key parameters on the red team's performance: (1) the maximum allowable team weight, (2) a health-based retreat threshold, and (3) a firepower-imbalance-based retreat threshold. By systematically varying these parameters, this study aims to elucidate their influence on mission outcomes, drone survivability, and overall swarm effectiveness, offering insights into robust strategy development for autonomous UAV operations."

Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, which struggle with agility and scalability, microservices allow for independent scaling and management of system components, optimizing resource utilization. This paper presents a modular communication service based on microservices architecture, demonstrating how event-driven messaging (Kafka), WebSockets for real-time interactions, and MinIO for distributed storage enable scalable, low-latency communication.

    "abstract": "Block adjustment is necessary for high-precision processing and the application of satellite images. The key to ensuring the quality of block adjustment is obtaining sufficient, reliable, and evenly distributed tie points through image matching. However, the automatic image matching technology is affected by multiple factors, such as imaging geometry, radiation quality, land cover, imaging time, etc., which lead to observation anomalies such as weak connections and disconnection of images in an image block. Particularly, when the scale of an image block is large, various observation anomalies may exist, which can neither be found in block adjustment through counting the number of tie points nor can be detected by the test of the relative positioning accuracy of tie points after block adjustment, resulting in inhomogeneous internal accuracy of an image block and severely affecting the quality of block adjustment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an automatic detection method for observation anomalies based on accuracy propagation within an image block, which achieves the accurate detection of various observation anomalies in the block beforehand to ensure the quality of block adjustment."

This paper is a comparison of three CNN frameworks - VGGFace16, DenseNet-121, and a self-designed custom CNN - on real vs. fake face discrimination using a dataset of $140,000+$ images. We utilized Explainable AI (XAI) methods, i.e., SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), to promote the interpretability of our bespoke CNN model. Our methodology attains classification accuracy values above 95% for all models, with the custom CNN showing equivalent performance to pre-trained models and even better. The research shows the advantages of using XAI in deepfake detection while studying architectural trade-offs between computational efficiency and feature extraction. Quantitatively, our tailored CNN obtains an ROC AUC of $\\mathbf{0. 9 9 5 6}$-well above VGGFace16 (0.9601) and DenseNet-121 (0.9924)-and is computationally effective, whereas qualitatively, the application of SHAP and LIME provides transparent explanations of the decision process, improving model transparency and credibility for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Bandwidth part (BWP) was introduced by 3GPP as a 5 G New Radio (NR) feature in Release 15. The performance of a User Equipment (UE) in each BWP depends on various factors such as its positioning, channel conditions, and fading. Due to these factors, a UE may perform relatively better in one BWP as compared to another. Considering this variation in performance, dynamically choosing the best BWP for a UE helps in increasing the throughput and reducing the delay to achieve better spectral efficiency. In this work, we address this problem through an MDP (Markov Decision Process) formulation which is solved using a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) model. We highlight how our solution can also flexibly consider the different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) required for different service types and UE priority classes to achieve better system performance overall. Using a time window based approach, the inference overhead is also reduced, and we discuss methods to address some potential deployment issues. We test the solution in various scenarios, achieving improvements of up to 50 in delay and 17 in throughput."

While Tsetlin Machines (TMs) achieve competitive performance in static pattern recognition, they process samples independently, limiting the application to sequential learning requiring temporal dependencies. This paper introduces the Recurrent Tsetlin Machine (RTM), extending TMs to sequential learning by using clause outputs from previous time steps as the recurrent state. This approach preserves TM’s interpretable Boolean operations while enabling temporal pattern recognition. The RTM evaluation on the C-element learning demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to conventional TMs (>95% vs 57%), with the model naturally converging to Finite State Machine representations that autonomously discover Mealy-machine-like behaviour with deterministic state transitions. This work establishes the first successful recurrent extension of Tsetlin Machines, opening opportunities for interpretable sequential learning."

Sentiment labels positive, negative, and neutral were assigned using an automatic annotation approach with the TextBlob library. Feature representation was performed using GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), and classification was conducted using the Random Forest algorithm. The best classification performance achieved an accuracy of 64% with the 80:20 training-test split, with the neutral class yielding the highest F1-score (0.71).

    "abstract": "The thermal performance of power electronic systems is critically influenced by the ability to maintain uniform temperatures across semiconductor devices. In serially mounted semiconductor arrangements, forced-air cooling often produces a progressive heating effect, causing downstream devices to operate at higher temperatures. This non-uniform thermal loading leads to localised hotspots, accelerated material degradation, and reduced operational reliability. This paper investigates passive geometric optimisation of an air-cooled aluminium heatsink to enhance thermal uniformity across three serially mounted IGBTs. A computational numerical model was developed in ANSYS Fluent, using steady-state simulations and validated by experimental temperature measurements from a physical test rig. The baseline model demonstrated temperature differences across the length of the heatsink of up to 7.85°C at 100W, confirming the presence of a significant temperature gradient. Geometric modifications were evaluated in the form of a step-cut recess in the heatsink fins. The optimised geometry, with recess depths of 31 mm and 14 mm, reduced the temperature difference to 0.43°C under identical operating conditions, representing over 90% improvement compared to the unmodified design. The findings demonstrate that position-specific geometric tailoring of heatsinks offers a cost-effective and manufacturable solution to improve temperature synchronisation in multi-device power systems."

The finite-dimensional basis of the internal states of the medium is intended to solve the problem of determining the stress-strain state of a transversely isotropic body of rotation, which is under the influence of mass forces that change according to a cyclic law. The basis is constructed on the basis of a general solution for the medium, in which the spatial state is represented as a superposition of flat auxiliary states, for the formation of which a fundamental system of polynomials is used. After constructing a basis for a spatial state, it is orthonormalized and the desired state is expanded into a Fourier series according to the elements of the orthonormal basis. The problem comes down to finding the Fourier coefficients, which are quadratures.A solution is presented for a circular cylinder made of transversely isotropic siltstone and subject to the action of a mass force that varies according to the law of sine and cosine. The accuracy of the solution was assessed. The result is presented in graphical form."

    "abstract": "RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) performs well in a lossless network. However, its performance drops dramatically when packet loss occurs. This limitation stems from the shortcomings of traditional solutions in packet loss recovery, which are explicitly reflected in the two stages of packet loss detection and packet loss retransmission. For packet loss detection, they either rely on implicit detection, which leads to misjudgment or use explicit notification methods that cannot effectively detect multiple lost packets. For packet loss retransmission, they either adopt the Go-back-N mechanism, which is inefficient or implement selective retransmission that still fails to retransmit all missing segments accurately. To address these issues, we propose SNACK, a novel packet recovery mechanism that combines explicit notification and selective NACK(negative acknowledgment) retransmission. SNACK brings two key improvements. First, it precisely detects lost packets through dynamic window monitoring. Second, it adapts to retransmission using SNACK frames, which can selectively request missing packets. Our NS-3 simulation results show that SNACK achieves strong performance under packet loss. When the loss rate is 1%, SNACK keeps the throughput within 10% of the lossless case. In multiflow scenarios, it reduces the average FCT (Flow Completion Time) by 24.8% compared to existing methods. These results demonstrate that SNACK provides efficient loss recovery in various network conditions."

In this formation, the SAR satellite can frequently observe and image the calibration satellite under the side-looking acquisition geometry, and calculate the calibration factor(CF). The proposed method reduces reliance on groundbased calibration sites, enables calibration intervals to align with the orbital period, and extends the capability for inorbit radiometric performance evaluation. More importantly, the entire calibration process is performed in the space environment, free from distortions caused by atmosphere, ionosphere, ground clutter, multipath effects and ambiguities, ensuring a truly ‘end-to-end’ measurement process."

At the same time, the competing ferromagnetic contributions of Fe and Ni with the antiferromagnetic tendencies of Mn and Cr enable a wide range of magnetic responses. In this work, three FeNiCrMnAl alloys with varying Al content are synthesized and analyzed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The results show a consistent convergence between EDS and LIBS data, with some Mn discrepancies attributed to matrix effects. Magnetic characterization reveals predominantly soft ferromagnetic behavior with low coercivity and composition-dependent anisotropy, most notably in the Al-containing alloys.

Following maximum accuracy human detection, the instantaneous position of the detected person is determined as the target, and optimal path following toward this target is achieved using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The MPC algorithm predict the required steering angle in real-time to reach the detected person by considering the vehicle's current state and dynamic constraints, while the speed value is calculated according to the remaining distance to the target.

A three-tier architecture system including client, application server and database server is designed, and abnormal traffic identification is realized through four functional modules: data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and intrusion detection response. An experiment of the designed system is conducted with the KDD99 dataset as the test object, and its performance indicators are compared with those of traditional systems. The results show that the system has a detection accuracy of 95.6%, a false alarm rate of 3.2%, a missed alarm rate of 1.2%, and a detection speed of 2000 data packets per second. All indicators are better than those of traditional systems. This system can effectively improve network security protection capabilities and provide technical support for intrusion detection in complex network environments."

    "abstract": "Drones and artificial intelligence (AI) offer a transformative approach to crop disease detection, enabling rapid and precise analysis beyond traditional methods. In this study, we developed and programmed a custom-built drone equipped with four 1500 kV brushless motors, a flight controller, 60-amp ESC, GPS, and a DJI O3 video transmission system. The hardware was assembled onto a carbon fiber frame with 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) components, and a Raspberry Pi 5 was integrated for real-time inferencing. The AI model for crop disease detection was trained using drone collected data and publicly available datasets from Kaggle, leveraging PyTorch with Python3 on an HPC Cluster with an Nvidia H100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7453 CPU. Autonomous drone flight paths were planned using Litchi waypoint navigation software to create an autonomous point-to-point navigation flight path. Using the training data a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) vanilla model was developed for training and inferencing the crop diseases from the images used in the dataset. Four major crops-corn, potato, rice, and wheat- covering 10 distinct diseases were analyzed. The model achieved an accuracy between 75% and 95% for most cases, except for rice crops, where performance was lower due to the thin leaves providing fewer distinguishing features. This issue can be mitigated with additional image augmentation and fine-tuning the CNN model. Although several challenges were encountered in securing access to local farms for large-scale testing, preliminary evaluations in controlled environments-including select accessible field and park settings-yielded promising results. Field testing confirmed the drone's ability to capture high-quality images even in light rain and cloudy conditions. The system, which costs under $ 500, achieved a maximum flight time of 27 minutes, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional soil sensors and soil culture testing. The early identification of crop diseases enables targeted interventions, conserving resources, reducing excessive pesticide use, and increasing crop yields."

The proposed explanation only partly matched the dynamics of the observed Ron fluctuations and only one device reference was tested. In this work, higher voltage spikes are explored and a device from an other manufacturer is also studied. We demonstrate with a ngspice simulation how all observed dynamic Ron behaviors can be explained with a two-diode model of the gate stack."

This work proposes a novel and detailed hardware architecture for the MLR algorithm. The architecture supports both the training and testing phases of prediction operation. A linear system is solved in MLR to find the co-efficient vector. In this work, this linear system in the training phase is solved by the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm which is an iterative algorithm. CG algorithm supports maximum resource sharing and gives better accuracy than other iterative algorithms. The architecture also uses a Gold-Schmidt iterative divider to reduce hardware complexity. The architecture is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for validation of performance with a freely available database of student performance analysis with 5 independent variables. A relative signal-to-ratio (RSNR) of 36 dB is achieved in this work in estimating the co-efficient vector using the CG algorithm and an RSNR of 28 dB is obtained in the prediction of 256 samples. The proposed architecture is hardware efficient, supports online sample-wise training, and has less overall training time compared to all existing works. The architecture is easily applicable to all real-time applications and scalable for any parameter values."

    "abstract": "The efficiency of wireless communication networks has significantly advanced over the last decade, however, multifaceted challenges persist, especially in urban areas and highspeed environments that combat multipath fading and Doppler spread. Urban terrains characterized by dense infrastructure, high population density, and high-rise buildings cause signal interference, multipath propagation, and shadowing, thus resulting in poor reliability of communication links and quality of service (QoS). This paper investigates a RIS-assisted ZPOTFS system operating at mm-Wave (millimeter-Wave) frequencies for high-speed wireless scenarios to mitigate severe fading and Doppler spread limitations. Three different scenarios are modeled using appropriate 5G NR TDL channels. Performance measures, BER and throughput, are estimated and analyzed for different geographical scenarios featuring distinct surrounding dynamics, user speed, and array size of RIS. The results obtained demonstrate enhanced BER and throughput for RIS-assisted ZPOTFS systems, and offer insights for future system architecture in high-mobility 5 G and beyond 5 G (B5G) networks paradigm."

To address these challenges, various assistive technologies have been developed, including smart electronic white canes equipped with ultrasonic or ToF sensors and smartphone-based applications that offer obstacle detection and route guidance. One factor that causes anxiety for visually impaired people is losing the spatial orientation they are.

In this work, we propose IDTM, an IDS based on the Tsetlin Machine (TM), using its logic-based learning mechanism to perform accurate and explainable classification of network traffic using the CIC-IDS dataset. To address significant challenges associated with class imbalance and high dimensionality, we employ the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), random undersampling, followed by Min-Max normalization and tailored binarization strategies. Features are discretized according to their statistical distribution: logarithmic transformation for highly skewed time-based features, quantile binning for bursty rate-based features, and uniform binning for others. This ensures compatibility with TM’s binary input requirements. Subsequently, Variance Thresholding and Extra Trees-based feature ranking were used to reduce noise to allow the model to focus on only informative features. Experimental results show that the TM achieves a high test accuracy of 99.07% while significantly outperforming conventional models in terms of inference time, demonstrating its potential as a lightweight, interpretable, and real-time-capable IDS solution. Additionally, the interpretable results demonstrate the importance of the various features of the data."

Our proposed structure aims to address the challenges of integrating TM/CTM with deep learning frameworks for dense learning tasks. Experimental validation in the CamVid dataset demonstrates that CTM-UNet successfully converges during training, achieving competitive performance with mean IoU scores comparable to conventional UNet while employing Tsetlin machine components.

In order to address this, we propose a novel HOI detection framework that integrates generative feature augmentation supervised by contrastive learning to enhance the discriminability of generated features. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative mining strategy to distinguish semantically similar yet distinct interaction categories. The proposed approach employs a multibranch network that aggregates multiscale features during inference. Further, self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms are utilized to enrich semantic representations and strengthen comprehension of complex interactions. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection performance for unseen interaction categories, achieving state-of-the-art generalization and robustness in zero-shot scenarios."

Existing datasets for this task are primarily designed for image-to-image matching, lack textual annotations, and mainly contain pedestrian groups captured from ground-based surveillance, with limited aerial perspectives. Due to the inter-group diversity and intragroup complexity of pedestrian groups, existing methods struggle to achieve robust alignment between visual and textual features of groups. To address these limitations, we introduce two cross-modal group datasets. First, we construct UAV-T by adding fine-grained textual descriptions to the existing UAV dataset. Second, we construct a new dataset by synthesizing UAV-based group images from the AG-ReID.v2 dataset: pedestrians captured from the same viewpoint are concatenated to form groups, and corresponding textual descriptions are provided to enable text-to-image group matching. Moreover, we propose Member-Guided Multimodal Alignment (MGMA) framework, a cross-modal group matching framework that effectively learns group-level representations by extracting and aligning visual and textual features of group members. Specifically, it models individual group members via Bbox-guided Masked Image Modeling (BMIM) and Masked Group Attribute Modeling (MGAM) modules to enable cross-modal interactions of group features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves noticeable improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches on both the AG-Group and UAV-T datasets."

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is widely used to measure physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, and blood oxygen saturation, and it is easily integrated into the wearables due to its small size and affordability. In recent years, the morphological and temporal features of PPG signals have been used to comprehend the physiological mechanisms associated with healthy and pathological conditions. Despite its wide range of applications above water, its use underwater remains limited. This study examines the effect of waterproofing materials such as epoxy and silicon on the waveform features of the PPG signal. The PPG sensor used is MAX30102, and the materials are coated on its surface. The PPG signal is recorded from healthy participants for 5 minutes as they remain seated. The collected signal is pre-processed using a Chebyshev Type II bandpass filter, and six features, namely systolic peak, diastolic peak, dicrotic notch, peak-to-peak interval, systolic time and diastolic time, are extracted from the signal and compared with uncoated and coated surfaces. The signal features are also compared with different thicknesses of silicon coating. The signal quality index (SQI) for epoxy, silicone, and uncoated sensor surfaces has no significant difference. The systolic amplitude is decreased by $17 \\%$ for silicon and $46 \\%$ for epoxy. The peak-to-peak interval has no significant difference for the three cases, which suggests that the PPG signal frequency remains unaffected. The findings indicated that silicone is more suitable compared to epoxy for waterproofing, paving the way for future progress in wearable underwater health monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of feeder link switching in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) by leveraging low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations with multiple shells and multiple gateway (GW) deployments. Due to the high mobility of LEO satellites and frequent feeder link disruptions, it is critical to maintain reliable feeder link connectivity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework that combines virtual network embedding (VNE) with advanced feeder link switching strategies. To manage the trade-off between link quality and switching frequency, lower-level optimization maximizes the data transmitted per feeder link connection using a path-finding algorithm with bisection search. The upper-level VNE problem enhances the connectivity between the satellites in the LEO mega-constellation and the ground infrastructure by constructing a dedicated virtual network for NTN GWs. Simulation results based on the Starlink Gen II constellation demonstrate that our proposed method consistently ensures 100% satellite activation, while baseline benchmarks achieve 93% satellite activation rates in the real-world GW deployments. Our optimization framework is well-suited for multiple shell deployments of LEO mega-constellations with multiple GW supports, paving the way for globally connected NTNs."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent surveillance technology, the massive amount of multimodal data (e.g., videos, images, and text) has imposed higher demands on efficient information retrieval and security. Traditional single-modal retrieval methods struggle to meet practical requirements, making multimodal image-text retrieval a research hotspot in this field. Existing approaches, however, still face challenges in fine-grained semantic alignment and suffer from rigid matching mechanisms. To address these issues, this paper introduces SeaNcr, a novel framework that integrates cross-modal semantic entity alignment with non-correspondence reasoning. Our method constructs class-level entity representations enhanced by saliency-guided masking to capture discriminative semantic features. A pseudo-frozen asynchronous optimization strategy is introduced to maintain semantic consistency across modalities by associating stable entity representations with dynamically updated encoder features. Moreover, to overcome rigid matching, we design a non-correspondence reasoning module that jointly leverages intra-modal similarity and cross-modal mutual nearest neighbor constraints, optimizing matching flexibility and generalization. Extensive experiments validate that SeaNcr significantly enhances cross-modal feature representation and retrieval robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple person re-identification benchmarks."

    "abstract": "LoRa has emerged as a strong wireless communication technology for IoT devices. The security challenges of LoRa have also raised various concerns. We propose SymScrab, a simple physical layer solution that significantly improves the security of LoRa without affecting the communication performance or consuming more communication resources. SymScrab encrypts the message by scrambling the baseband samples with a pseudo-random permutation, which is easy to recover by the legitimate receiver who has the same permutation, but impossible for an adversary. We further propose a physical layer Message Integrity Check (MIC) that rejects spoofed packets because spoofed packets do not exhibit expected physical layer features. We provide a rigorous security analysis of SymScrab and prove guarantees for confidentiality and integrity. We implement SymScrab as an extension to the open-source implementation of LoRa, and test it with both over-the-air experiments and simulations. The results confirm that SymScrab does not negatively affect communication performance."

Firstly, we employ a neural network (NN) to approximate the nonlinear uncertainties. Then, an adaptive NN-based event-triggered (ET) feedback control scheme is designed. This scheme mitigates the chattering effect resulting from high-frequency switching by incorporating an adaptive boundary layer method. Notably, the proposed dynamic triggering function relies only on agents' local state, without continuous communication with neighboring agents. It is theoretically shown that consensus error is ultimately uniformly bounded. Additionally, Zeno behavior is also shown to be excluded. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Based on projected climatic trends, the U.S. dairy industry faces escalating heat stress challenges, with milk production losses projected to reach 1.4 kg/day per cow by the 2050s and 1.9 kg/day per cow by the 2080s, resulting in economic losses of $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. While extensive cooling mechanisms are in place, they cannot fully mitigate heat stress effects. Thermotolerance, influenced by physiological and behavioral traits, varies significantly among individual cows and is crucial for sustaining dairy productivity. This paper presents an approach for automatically monitoring and recognizing behavior for dairy cows potentially relevant to thermotolerance, which utilizes various Machine Learning (ML) (e.g., CNN and YOLOv8) and Computer Vision (CV) (e.g., Video Processing and Annotation) techniques aimed at quantifying key behavioral indicators, specifically drinking frequency, brush use-behaviors, and social interactions such as headbutting. We evaluated the developed system using two different video datasets. The first dataset was captured using cameras installed at a side angle, while the second dataset was obtained using top-down camera views. Evaluation results showed that the YOLOv8 and CNN models achieved classification accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, on the first dataset, while the second dataset yielded 94% for YOLOv8 and 96% for CNN. Beyond experimental validation, the model is currently deployed for large-scale analysis of over 38,000 video recordings from a commercial ranch in Texas. This deployment enables automated extraction of behavioral event counts, specifically drinking and brushing, for each video, providing high-resolution behavioral summaries at scale. These findings show the robustness and operational viability of the system. The insights gained from this work hold significant promise for advancing genetic selection and management practices, equipping the dairy industry to proactively address heat stress and enhance overall herd resilience in the face of evolving climatic challenges."

    "abstract": "As the sixth-generation (6G) networks evolve towards a deep integration of communication and computation (ICC), they face challenges of inherent interference and resource competition between heterogeneous services. To address this issue, this paper investigates an uplink ICC system enhanced by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), where SIM’s unique multi-layer structure transforms the wireless channel into a controllable, task-oriented medium. The system is designed to support the coexistence of over-the-air computation (AirComp) tasks, which require high-precision results, and traditional tasks that demand high-quality communication. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization framework aiming to minimize the total mean squared error (MSE) of all computation tasks while strictly guaranteeing the communication quality of service (QoS). To solve the highly non-convex problem of synergistically designing the system resources, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only converges rapidly but also achieves up to a 95.2% reduction in total computation MSE compared to an ICC system without SIM, while also significantly outperforming other benchmark schemes, validating the great potential of SIM in proactively managing multi-service conflicts and enabling efficient ICC."

Although QKD ensures information-theoretic security, its limited key generation rate poses challenges for scalable content delivery. To address this, we introduce a mechanism using random linear network coding in mesh topologies, where nodes adaptively collect and forward packets based on network conditions such as bandwidth and link quality. Evaluations show that our method enables low-latency delivery even under constrained bandwidth scenarios, and can suppress key usage compared to conventional IP multicast over single-tree topologies, depending on network scale and structure."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of distributed secure state estimation for cyber-physical systems under sparse sensor attacks. Traditional centralized methods struggle with high computational complexity in large-scale systems, while existing distributed approaches either require strong robustness constraints for graphs or face challenges due to local unobservability. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed adaptive saturation method. This method designs an adaptive saturation function for each node to limit the impact of attacks on the estimation residual. Additionally, it integrates a consensus protocol to enable cooperative estimation of nodes, effectively mitigating the influence of malicious attacks. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm ensures consensus estimation under fixed attack channels, with estimation errors ultimately bounded. Furthermore, by refining the saturation mechanism for each node, the algorithm is extended to scenarios with time-varying attacks. Simulation experiments validate that the proposed method effectively handles sparse sensor attacks, reduces computational complexity, and significantly enhances system robustness."

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of mean-square stability and stabilization under an energy harvesting sensor, where the sensor can harvest energy from the external environment. When the sensor's energy is insufficient to maintain regular communication between the sensor and the controller, the sampled data packets are regarded as missing. Otherwise, they can be successfully transmitted in the communication network. To address this problem, we first establish a continuous-time modeling framework for a class of randomly sampled systems with an energy harvesting sensor. Then, a corresponding discrete-time stochastic model is constructed. By establishing the equivalence between the continuous-time and resulting discrete-time systems, a stabilizing controller is designed to guarantee the mean-square stability of randomly sampled systems. In particular, the limit of the probability of successfully transmitting sampled packets is derived, which plays a critical role in the equivalence analysis of systems, as well as the controller design. Finally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design strategy, where both energy-harvestingconstrained and energy-harvesting-constraint-free scenarios are illustrated."

    "abstract": "Tracking moving targets is fundamental task in many applications of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). In practice, the visual information is hard to be processed in real time for detecting fast-moving and agile targets, and the conventional control method is difficult to track them. To address the challenge, a monocular vision based comprehensive framework for UAVs to track fast moving targets is proposed. In particular, the real-time visual target detection and measurement method with YOLOv8 is designed, and the model predictive contouring control is employed as the UAV control algorithm to optimize the control process, enabling the UAV to follow randomly moving targets. Finally, experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under realistic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging has demonstrated strong potential for the classification of Chinese herbal medicines (CHM). However, conventional push-broom systems rely on back-end PCs for spectral analysis, resulting in substantial data transfer overhead and limiting their applicability in real-time, energy-efficient edge scenarios. To address this, we propose an integrated sensing–computing processor. A complete hyperspectral imaging electronics system is developed, along with an dual-branch model, push-broom vision transformer (PBViT), which combines a frequency-domain encoding branch with an improved ViT architecture and contains only 0.075 MB of parameters. On the CHM dataset, PBViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with an OA of 0.978, AA of 0.942, and Kappa of 0.950, surpassing traditional machine learning, convolutional, and ViT-based methods. Leveraging quantization-aware training (QAT), the model is compressed to 8-bit precision with negligible accuracy loss. We further develop an FPGA-based accelerator for PBViT, achieving 502 GOPS throughput and 32.2 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\mathbf{s}$</tex-math></inline-formula> latency per <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$9\\boldsymbol{\\times} 9$</tex-math></inline-formula> patch, with a power consumption of 14.42 W.

This research designs a UPQC by optimally selecting the gains of a FOPIDC, the inductance and resistance values of filters, and the gain parameters for the PIC of the storage battery and wind energy systems. It also optimizes the parameters of DC-DC boost and buck-boost converters using the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). Additionally, this work employs a Levenberg-Marquardt Back propagation (LMBP) neural network (NN) control for accurate reference signal generation. The main goal is to address PQ issues like interruptions, sags, harmonic distortion, swell, DC-link voltage balancing, and reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the source current in a grid-connected system that integrates wind energy systems (WES), solar energy, and EVs. The study also introduces a novel power flow algorithm that manages the transfer of power between the renewable sources, grid, EVs and battery storage, thereby facilitating seamless power exchange between solar/wind/battery systems, the grid, and consumer/ industrial loads. This facilitates to ensure a consistent power supply, efficient demand fulfillment, and optimal use of generated power. The study demonstrates that the optimized UPQC, collectively with power flow management, can successfully address PQ issues and achieve efficient power sharing with reduced THD levels of 3.58%, 1.22%, and 4.36%. To exhibit the performance of the system comparison is carried out with standard genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms."

    "abstract": "Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for semantic segmentation (SS) in agriculture applications. However, cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS, disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, which decreases the performance of models pre-trained on complete SITS. Existing methods typically address this challenge by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may introduce noise and redundancy, whereas the data augmentation model can only handle limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address incomplete SITS more effectively. Specifically, we simulate temporal missing scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task constrains the model from selectively reconstructing temporal features, ensuring they align with the teacher’s complete representations and are beneficial for prediction. It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns and complete SITS. The experiments show strong generalization capabilities in multiple aspects: (1) Different SS tasks, including cropland extraction and crop classification; (2) Different study areas, including Hunan Province,Western France, and Catalonia; (3) Different sensors, primarily Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope; (4) Different numbers of time gaps, while retaining the model’s performance on complete SITS; (5) Different model architectures, including seven typical backbones.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a promising solution for emergency communications due to their rapid deployment and capability of flexible network formation. This flexibility enables UAVs to dynamically adjust their positions and link configurations to form stable multi-hop networks, thereby establishing resilient data links from isolated disaster areas to remote base stations. However, sustaining such a persistent UAV swarm network is challenging due to limited onboard energy, the scarcity of available UAVs, and complex coordination in emergencies. This paper aims to minimize the number of UAVs required while ensuring continuous multi-hop connectivity for all target areas under energy constraints. We propose a UAV swarm planning strategy based on non-fixed relay points (USP-NFRP), jointly optimizing UAV-to-target associations, trajectories, and the backhaul topology connecting target areas to the base station. First, we propose a periodic rotation path (PRP) method to efficiently manage UAV replacements and assignments at disaster sites. We also provide a mathematical proof of its effectiveness. Second, we propose a dynamic tree backhaul link (DTBL) method that ensures persistent and seamless network connectivity. It is achieved by adjusting the positional roles of relay nodes (fixed or non-fixed) during path planning and dynamically configuring tree-based backhaul links during UAV missions. Finally, we develop a max-min ant system-based path planning algorithm (MMAS-PP) to optimize UAV trajectories and the sequence of task executions. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy reduces the number of UAVs by up to 30.9% compared with baselines."

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the $21{ }^{\\text {st }}$ century, the development of info-communication technology, coupled with the growing demand for renewable energy sources, has made the need to rethink the electricity networks. The need for a more decentralised electricity network has emerged, in contrast to the large centralised system. A smart grid is an electricity network that uses information and communication technologies to gather information about the habits of suppliers and consumers, and then uses this information to automatically increase the efficiency, reliability, economy and sustainability of the grid. We are currently living in an era of energy transition, with smart grids operating mainly through pilot projects. In our research, we analysed in-depth interviews with smart grid experts, mainly practitioners, to find out how they perceive the problems and challenges of smart grid management. As little empirical research has been published so far on the attitudes of utilities of smart grids, our research is unique. We have found that smart grid experts with extensive experience focus primarily on utilities, in their view they are the key players in smart grids. In addition, some of them are aware of the complexity of smart grid management."

They can be applied to resource inventory management and energy problems, such as fuel and energy cost allocation. A software implementation of the algorithms in Python was developed and implemented. Quantitative performance evaluations of the swarm algorithms were obtained using three criteria: convergence rate, accuracy of the approximate solution, and stability of results across repeated runs. It was found that the bee colony algorithm demonstrated stability and the ability to perform global search, especially with increasing problem complexity. The particle swarm method demonstrates high convergence rates on smooth functions but is prone to premature stabilization at local minima."

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) and DT technologies offer promising avenues for early detection, their adoption in clinical settings introduces significant concerns around data security, system vulnerabilities, and model trust. In response, this paper proposes a novel, trusted medical AI framework that combines blockchain-based device authentication, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and DT technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy, data integrity, and system resilience. The proposed system leverages ResNet for lung condition classification from CT scans, augmented by Grad-CAM for visual explainability, enabling clinicians to interpret AI-driven decisions confidently. A blockchain-based whitelist mechanism authenticates medical devices before data contribution, mitigating risks of tampered or unverified input. Furthermore, the framework integrates explainable digital twin visualization to simulate patient-specific predictions and embeds a vulnerability detection layer to identify and mitigate software flaws in medical IoT and DT components. This comprehensive solution addresses key challenges in real-world healthcare: ensuring data authenticity, interpretability, and cyber resilience, paving the way for secure, transparent, and trustworthy AI-driven diagnostics."

The paper analyzes one of such systems, namely the stability of homeostasis functioning, which is characterized by a certain variability as a result of reaction to the external environment. Analysis of the state of homeostasis is especially important in studies of a human operator, whose professional activity is associated with the constant influence of destabilization factors, in particular, the operator of the aviation industry, in which the human factor occupies a special place. Therefore, the article considers the urgent task of developing methodological approaches to analyzing the stability of the state of operators based on existing biodata to obtain additional useful insights that will expand the understanding of the phase state of a biological object based on time series. The use of nonlinear dynamics methods makes it possible to analyze the phase state of an object and study the chaotic nature of its behavior, which in turn makes it possible, based on the additional information obtained, to assess the level of stability of the operator's functional state, which makes it possible to predict violations and, as a result, eliminate the threat of failure to fulfill duties in the professional sphere, and reduce the overall level of risk in the socio-technical system."

One of the indicators of energy security is gross oil consumption, the forecasting of which allows to see the prospective use of fuel types and changes in the structure of the energy balance. MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks were used to construct short-term forecasts for 2 years ahead. Time series of different lengths were considered with 80, 88, 126 initial points, which were the values of gross oil consumption of each month. Such data are available in national statistics since 2015. The simulation was performed with different neural network parameters. The number of hidden neurons was minimal (1 or 2) and maximal (4, 6, 8, 9). Identity, logistic, hyperbolic and exponential functions in various combinations were used as the activation functions of hidden neurons and the output neuron. A series of models were obtained, which were analyzed using network performance analysis and graphical visualization. Forecasts showed close results in all models in terms of convergence of calculated and actual values (at the level of 5–8%). Annual values of gross oil consumption were calculated using the best calculation model. During the modeling process, it was found that increasing the number of hidden neurons and the type of activation functions slightly affects the performance of neural networks, and increasing the length of the series improves the quality of the forecast. The quality of forecasts for the last two years was checked. The discrepancy between the predicted and actual annual values for these years was 7.7% and (-4.6%), and for the entire series of values, on average, it was (-1.4%). The use of neural networks for short-term forecasting showed satisfactory results, and the method can be used to forecast other indicators."

The framework incorporates a selector that actively employs the Gumbel distribution to dynamically pick the most effective sensors for the next sensing cycle. Rather than applying a single selector layer across all sensors, we introduce a patched forecasting approach to account for temporal patterns inherent in sensing cycles.

This research examined the efficacy of high-resolution imagery sourced from the SkySat earth imaging satellites combined with a random forest (RF) classification algorithm for detecting blackberry infestations in Australia. The study estimated the change in blackberry infestation between El Niño and La Niña seasons. The RF model using spectral information alone achieved a producer accuracy of 99.1% and a user accuracy of 98.7% while using the textural GLCM features alone, the producer accuracy was 91% and user accuracy was 95.5%. The combination of the spectral and textural GLCM features produced an RF model that achieved a producer accuracy of 98.2% while the user accuracy was 99.4%. The study observed that blackberry infestations were fivefold higher during the period coinciding with the climatic phenomenon La Niña, which was characterised by widespread changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures. This study paves the way for future investigations into satellite remote sensing and machine learning for managing WoNS in Australia."

It is shown that accurate modeling of the coupling coefficients of slot elements is a complex task that requires simplified theoretical models and experimental verification. It is established that slot elements provide stable frequency characteristics and effective spectrum compression in semi-symmetric ORs. Methods for estimating losses using Fresnel numbers, approximation formulas and adjustment parameters are proposed.

By contrast, the 1 GW case demonstrates a clear advantage of economies of scale: the unit investment cost declines significantly, reducing the LCOE to 0.0395 USD/kWh and shortening the payback period to 7.99 years. This substantial improvement illustrates the pivotal role that large-scale projects could play in overcoming cost barriers and achieving financial viability. Ultimately, this study highlights that while small projects represent the realistic entry point for Azerbaijan, long-term cost reductions and supportive policy measures will be crucial to enable the transition toward economically viable large-scale SPT development."

    "abstract": "The article presents a composite anomaly detection method for energy consumption data that can be effective when there are collective anomalies in data. This method comprises three key stages. Stage one detects change points for time series properties to split the series into segments. At stage two, the segments are classified for collective anomalies presence using anomaly analysis methods that work well for collective anomalies. The result of the second stage is the detection of collective anomalies in the data. At stage three, collective anomalies are excluded from the data, and only the remaining point anomalies are searched for using the anomaly analysis methods effective in point anomaly detection. The advantage of the proposed complex approach is that it allows for a high data anomalies detection efficiency."

    "abstract": "The possibility of using a linear antenna array with a non-equidistant arrangement of elements to create a radiation power flux density to ensure wireless energy transmission was analyzed. The antenna array was supposed to be powered with equal amplitude without the ability to control the phase of the signal in individual antenna elements. Such scenarios of using an antenna array can occur when organizing virtual antenna arrays, for example, on mobile media. To minimize the influence of the radiation patterns of individual antenna elements, the study was conducted using the example of half-wave dipoles in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the dipoles. The effect of the placement of antenna elements in the centers of even or odd Fresnel zones of an equivalent focusing system on the properties of the antenna array was studied by numerical simulation. The dependences of the radiation pattern and the gain coefficient on the equivalent focal length, and the frequency dependences of the array gain for different focal lengths are obtained. The behavior of the radiation power flux density generated by the antenna array on the distance from the center of the array is shown. The spatial distributions of the radiation power flux density created by a non-equidistant antenna array and an equidistant array with the same aperture size are compared. Despite the use of a single and suboptimal method for controlling the antenna array parameters, such a structure can be used for wireless charging of low-power devices."

The paper proposes an integrated quality index formed from weighted objective metrics, namely, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, the structural similarity index, and the correlation coefficient. These metrics are calculated for luminance and color-difference signals. Tables of metric values are provided for six intermediate images corresponding to six different exposures, from underexposed to overexposed. The quality index is calculated for each intermediate image involved in the reconstruction of the high-dynamic-range image. Using the set of quality indices, a probability density function is constructed, and statistical metrics are determined. The proposed method allows to predict the quality of the reconstructed high-dynamic-range image, taking into account the contribution of each intermediate image with different exposure times. Based on the analysis of statistical moments, a conclusion is drawn regarding the possibility of optimizing the number of intermediate images."

In this paper, we propose a simple and flexible approach based on evolutionary computation to generate weekly meal plans observing structural, numerical as well as harmony constraints, using a configurable dietary rule base and a limited food database. The method is based on a set of ontologies for modeling expert concepts, a structural model, and a rule base with three types of dietary rules that can describe a wide range of requirements. Besides, we propose an extension of the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm to support the enforcement of the rules, and a reinforcement learning based mutation operator. The approach has been validated in a smallscale proof-of-concept study with a limited set of foods and rules. The results show the viability of the proposed mutation operator and that the effect of dietary rules can be controlled via the model parameters. Further work is needed to extend the proposed approach to more realistic food and rule bases."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the deployment of information-stealing malware, with keyloggers emerging as a persistent threat to individuals, enterprises, and critical information systems. Among these, Snake Keylogger, a.NET-based malware first identified in November 2020, has gained notoriety for its credential-stealing and keylogging capabilities. It primarily propagates through phishing and spear phishing campaigns, typically utilizing malicious Office documents or PDFs to deliver downloader scripts via PowerShell. Once executed, Snake Keylogger captures keystrokes, steals saved credentials, extracts clipboard data, and takes screenshots to exfiltrate sensitive information. As of 2025, Snake Keylogger has continued to evolve, adopting advanced evasion techniques such as process hollowing, the use of suspended child processes for payload injection, and heavily obfuscated code, all of which complicate detection and response efforts. Notably, security reports indicate increasing prevalence and spikes in zero-day detections, underscoring its continued threat to both personal and organizational cybersecurity. In this work, the results of static and dynamic analysis of a snake keylogger are presented. The findings from this analysis contribute to the development of more robust detection, defence, and mitigation strategies against Snake Keylogger and similarly evolving malware familie"

    "abstract": "The influx of massive network device nodes has increased the security threats faced by complex network systems. However, the application of traditional active defense technologies to complex network systems always assumes that the occurrence of network attacks and their impact on the system can be evaluated. In other words, complex network defense systems can achieve robustness against predictable network attacks, but they may still remain fragile when facing unpredictable attacks, or even “Black Swan” attacks. Inspired by the antifragility exhibited by flora and fauna in ecosystems, this paper innovatively studies the antifragility security defense mechanism in the field of network security, aiming to enhance the security defense capabilities of complex network defense systems. Firstly, we define the concept of antifragility for the complex network defense system. Then, the antifragility complex network defense system model is constructed, which includes cyber deception module, service redundancy module and learning and evolution module. To evaluate whether the complex network defense system model possesses antifragility, we propose an antifragility assessment method for the complex network defense system, which analyzes how the system benefits under network attack pressures. Finally, the security and reliability of the antifragility complex network defense system are verified through experiments."

First, analyzed the circuit topology and basic control principle of the three-phase AC-DC-AC converter, and then constructed a simulation circuit model of the three-phase AC- DC-AC converter in the MWORKS software environment. analyzed the DC bus ripple voltage characteristics and the output voltage waveforms of the three-phase Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) inverter before and after adding the decoupling circuit. Simulation results show that the ratio of the maximum fluctuation range of the ripple voltage to the DC component decreases from 4.5% before decoupling to 0.4%, the DC bus voltage is significantly improved, and the waveform distortion degree of the output voltage of the SPWM inverter is also obviously reduced."

This paper proposes an autonomous navigation system that does not rely on GPS, GNSS or external markers. It instead utilizes custom navigation algorithms in place of traditional positioning systems. The navigation system employs a stereo depth camera, LiDAR, and an optical flow sensor. To process environmental data more efficiently, the system employs a 'tunnel vision' approach, which narrows the field of view to reduce computational load. This is complemented by a sliding window algorithm for processing the area in a linear manner, systematically searching for landable/landing zones. These algorithms can be effectively applied in GPS-denied environments, such as disaster-stricken areas, to facilitate rapid assessment and mapping of affected zones."

During the teaching process, based on the OBE concept, through mixed teaching methods such as “combination of virtual and real elements + project-driven approach”, students were enabled to make a transformation from “receiving teaching” to “guiding learning”. During the teaching process, based on the implementation of the “student-centered” teaching model, students are fully enabled to autonomously construct their learning patterns in terms of emotions, cognition, and other aspects. Utilizing AI intelligent tools and information technology to optimize teaching content and improve informationbased teaching resources has enhanced learning outcomes. At the same time, a diversified evaluation system has been established, with an increase in process-based evaluations.

    "abstract": "Accidents involving powered two-wheelers, such as motorcycles and scooters, pose significant safety risks, particularly under low-visibility conditions. Rapid detection and response to these incidents are crucial to minimize injuries and fatalities. This paper presents the development of a system for indicating a fallenpowered two-wheeler that will alert nearby people about the fallen two-wheelers. It will enhance visibility where it cannot be directly visible owing to dark or geometrical conditions with audible loud sirens and lights. The system was designed using a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer, a microcontroller, and an alarm system to enhance accident detection and alert mechanisms. MEMS accelerometer continuously monitored the orientation and motion of the two-wheeler. Upon detecting an abnormal tilt or sudden impact that is indicative of a fall, the microcontroller processes the accelerometer data to confirm the occurrence of an accident. Once confirmed, the system activates an integrated alarm comprising visual (light) and auditory (sound) signals. These alarms are designed to penetrate low-visibility conditions, such as fog, rain, or darkness, ensuring that nearby individuals or emergency responders quickly locate the fallen vehicle. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective solution to enhance road safety for powered two-wheeler(PTW) users, potentially reducing response times and improving outcomes in accident scenarios. The implications of this system will make PTWs safer and inspire simplicity and modularity in their implementation in the PTW industry."

We assessed the screening accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the GPT-4o Mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models, as well as a human rater. We also compared the time and costs of completing the title/abstract screening by two human raters versus one human assisted by LLMs. LLMassisted screening required less time and money than two human raters, but it was also less accurate, resulting in extra work to rescreen discrepancies. Nevertheless, combining LLMs with the human ratings improved the quality of the screening output. Our results suggest that the tested LLMs are not as reliable as expert humans, however, they can assist in the title/abstract screening process and improve the quality of work with very low extra resources."

This project attempts to restore high-frequency details from such low-resolution inputs using a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm. Although classic interpolation or CNN-based approaches try pixel-level precision, they tend to fail to reconstruct realistic textures and sharp structures. To address this, we use a super-resolution model with perceptual quality adversarial training that emphasizes visual realism over minimizing reconstruction error. This is also illustrated on a chosen image region of pixels, and it really leads to notable improvement in edge sharpness and texture coherence. Performance is measured quantitatively in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics with values of 31.09 dB and 0.8313 respectively and further confirmed in terms of visual comparison and pixel-wise error heatmaps. With emphasis laid on both qualitative and quantitative measures, this project demonstrates a successful approach to the problem of rendering high-resolution imagery from poor-quality data."

    "abstract": "Training a neural network for pixel based classification task using low resolution Landsat images is difficult as the size of the training data is usually small due to less number of available pixels that represent a single class without any mixing with other classes. Due to this scarcity of training data, neural network may not be able to attain expected level of accuracy. This limitation could be overcome using a generative network that aims to generate synthetic data having the same distribution as the sample data with which it is trained. In this work, we have proposed a methodology for improving the performance of ANN classifier to identify built-up pixels in the Landsat7 image with the help of developing a simple GAN architecture that could generate synthetic training pixels when trained using original set of sample built-up pixels. To ensure that the marginal and joint distributions of all the bands corresponding to the generated and original set of pixels are indistinguishable, non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and Ball Divergence based Equality of Distributions Test have been performed respectively. It has been observed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the ANN model for built-up classification have continuously improved from 0.9331 to 0.9983 and 0.8277 to 0.9958 respectively, with the inclusion of generated sets of built-up pixels to the original one."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation faces critical challenges from blurred boundaries and inter-patient anatomical variations, which significantly limit clinical applications. Traditional U-Net architectures, constrained by the local receptive fields of convolutional operations, fail to effectively model long-range dependencies and lack adaptive feature fusion strategies for diverse anatomical characteristics, resulting in low segmentation accuracy for small organs and large boundary localization errors. To address these issues, we propose DSM-UNet, a novel architecture integrating dual-path Swin Transformers and Mamua dlocks with cross-level skip connections. The network employs an innovative dual-branch synergy mechanism. the Swin branch captures gloval anatomical structural relationships through hierarchical window attention, while the Mamba branch dynamically models individual anatomical variations via selective state-space processing. Cross-level s.ip connections enable multi-scale feature complementarity, specifically enhancing boundary details and small-organ feature representation. Experimental results on the Synapse multi-organ abdominal dataset demonstrate that DSM-UNet achieves an average Dice score of $80.12 \\%$, outperforming the current model SwinUNet by $0.99 \\%$, with particularly significant improvements in organs susceptible to individual variations (e.g., gallbladder and left kidney). On the ACDC cardiac dataset, DSM-UNet attains an $88.47 \\%$ Dice score for myocardium segmentation, a $\\mathbf{2 . 8 5 \\%}$ improvement over SwinUNet, while maintaining comparable boundary distance error (HD). Ablation studies further validate that the Mamba module’s adaptability to individual variations and cross-level connections’ boundary refinement contribute $\\mathbf{1 . 2 \\%}$ and $\\mathbf{0 . 8 \\%}$ Dice improvements, respectively. In summary, DSM-UNet effectively balances global structural modeling and dynamic individual adaptability through the synergistic integration of Swin and Mamba, providing an efficient and robust solution for medical image segmentation challenges."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an architecture for high-level drone navigation with reinforcement learning (RL) while providing low-level stability via a pre-tuned proportional-integralderivative (PID) controller. In contrast to traditional navigation that uses only hand-crafted control policies, our method adopts deep reinforcement learning for planning waypoint-based trajectories and stability through Bayesian optimization (BO)tuned PID control. The framework integrates a model-free RL algorithm -proximal policy optimization (PPO) - to learn optimal navigation policies, where the BO-tuned PID controller is responsible for stabilizing thrust, roll, pitch, and yaw. Our approach is deployed in a 3D PyBullet simulation environment where the drone follows given waypoints and steers around obstacles. The hybrid RL-BO-tuned-PID method guarantees accurate tracking through RL’s adaptability and classical control’s robustness. By experimental verification, we show that our framework performs stable flight and efficient waypoint navigation and surpasses the RL-only baselineline methods in convergence rate, trajectory smoothness, and control stability. This work contributes to the field of autonomous aerial robotics by offering a systematic way of combining RL with BO-tuned PID control for improved drone navigation and stability in turbulent environments where altitude must be maintained and the drone should not drift away."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of cyberattacks demands more intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to identify or mitigate the effects of malicious activities in networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in many tasks, current approaches using zero-shot and few-shot classification have shown limited results for flow-based intrusion detection, with zero-shot yielding poor performance for the more complex attack types and few-shot exhibiting high variance. This paper introduces X-Flow, a two-stage explanation-guided approach that leverages LLM-generated explanations to enhance LLM-based network intrusion detection. X-Flow generates class-level natural language explanations from labeled data, which are then injected into the classification prompt of another LLM for real-time detection. Evaluated on the CIDDS-001 dataset across five LLMs, X-Flow improves macro F1-score over zero-shot classification, with substantial improvements across all the models, with gains of 12.9 to 39.2 points in the more competitive models GPT-4.1 and Gemma 27B. X-Flow also improves over few-shot classification in competitive models, achieving better F1-score, precision, and reduced variance, though gains are more modest. We find that smaller models with poor baseline performance show limited benefit from enriched prompts, suggesting they may require stronger interventions to acquire domain-specific knowledge from tabular IDS datasets. X-Flow also outperforms a recently proposed deep learning method explicitly trained on CIDDS-001 by up to 17.6 F1-score points. Our findings show that providing human-readable context in the prompt can effectively transfer knowledge from labeled IDS datasets, increasing the effectiveness and interpretability of LLMs in flow-based intrusion detection with a computational cost similar to that of few-shot prompting. We also release the generated explanations as a dataset to facilitate broader cybersecurity applications."

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly multimodal large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for addressing these critical safety issues. This paper presents the development of a lightweight embedded system designed to detect hazardous driving behaviors such as subtle drowsiness or mobile phone usage by drivers. The system leverages the Gemini API, an advanced multimodal LLM capable of realtime image analysis, enabling efficient and accurate detection of accident-prone behaviors without extensive local computing resources. Our proposed solution comprises three modules: continuous image capture of the driver, image analysis via Gemini API, and real-time auditory alerts triggered upon detection of risky behaviors. Initial evaluations demonstrate high accuracy, minimal latency, and robust performance under realistic conditions, validating our hypothesis that utilizing cloud-based multimodal LLMs significantly enhances the detection of driver distraction and fatigue. Future work includes adapting the system to mobile devices, utilizing smartphone front cameras, and exploring open-source models for cost-effective deployment."

    "abstract": "A key difficulty in solving multi-objective optimization problems is that multiple solutions may be considered optimal, without a clear criterion for selecting among them. Traditionally, this issue is resolved by involving a decision maker, a domain expert familiar with the task at hand. Their involvement results in an interactive optimization process, but one that cannot be automated efficiently. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose replacing the decision maker with a Large Language Model (LLM), which would be responsible for guiding the optimization in the appropriate direction. The goal of our work is thus to develop an LLM-based decision support system capable of assisting and directing a multiobjective Epsilon-constraint optimization procedure to identify the most suitable solution. Large language models represent a promising alternative to human expertise, as they possess a level of generalizable knowledge and human-like reasoning skills. In addition, they are capable of generating creative ideas, which can be particularly useful for tasks requiring the identification of connections between data points."

    "abstract": "Introns, as non-coding sequences in eukaryotic genes, play important roles in gene regulation and the maintenance of genome stability. Transposable elements (TEs), as the major components of repetitive genomic sequences, exert particularly important regulatory functions within introns. Although existing deep learning tools have made progress in TE classification, there is still a lack of models specifically designed for plant intronic TEs. To address this gap, this study proposes IntronTE, a deep learning classification model designed for plant intronic TEs. The model transforms DNA sequences into vector representations through k-mer embedding, and employs a hybrid architecture that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a squeeze-and-excitation based on a residual network (SE-ResNet) module for hierarchical feature extraction. Within a multi-task learning framework, IntronTE simultaneously classifies TEs at both the order (4 classes) and the superfamily (16 classes) levels. Using five-fold cross-validation on a filtered dataset of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6 2, 1 1 7}$</tex> TE sequences, IntronTE achieved average accuracies of 97.20 % at the order level and 96.25 % at the superfamily level. In independent tests on Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and soybean, the classification accuracy exceeded 90% across all species, with maize and soybean achieving over 97 % in both accuracy and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 1}$</tex>-score.

    "abstract": "The requirementfor accurate anomaly detection in cellular infrastructure is not merely a technical necessity, but a fundamental requirement in maintaining service quality and user satisfaction in this era of massive connectivity. Any disruption, no matter how minor, to the 4G LTE networks we rely on—from total outages to subtle performance degradation—has a tangible impact. To address this urgency, our research launched a head-to-head comparison among four leading candidates: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and the unexpected champion, XGBoost. Interestingly, we decided to test them ‘naked’—directly against hourly KPI data from networks in Indonesia, rich in mobility and throughput metrics, without any ‘assistance’ such as SMOTE. The goal was to test their inherent robustness on imbalanced real-world data. And from the result, XGBoost emerged as the best performer: achieving an astonishing accuracy of 99.69% and a near-perfect F1 score of 99.85%. While Support Vector Machines also showed commendable strength (F1 98.04%), the other two competitors, KNN (96.25%) and Random Forest (96.51%), struggled, especially in distinguishing minority classes and producing too many false positives. The conclusion is crystal clear: In the face of the harsh class imbalance endemic to network data, XGBoost proves its fundamental superiority in classifying diverse anomalies. This is an algorithm that should be at the forefront of future mobile monitoring system design, allowing us to move from mere monitoring to true proactivity."

    "abstract": "Computation task offloading is crucial in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, especially for time-sensitive applications requiring decentralized decision-making and coordination among multiple edge servers. Most existing Deep Rinforcement Learning (DRL)-based offloading methods rely on value-based or policy-based algorithms under centralized frameworks or distributed settings that rarely explicitly address independent decision-making by edge devices. In particular, discrete Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) remains largely unexplored for IIoT task scheduling. This paper formulates distributed task scheduling as a partially observable Markov decision process, where each device independently makes offloading decisions to maximize long-term task completion while minimizing processing delay. Core system elements are mapped into state, action, and reward spaces. DSAC is applied to handle the discrete and uncertain environment. Experiments in a simulated IIoT setting with 5 edge servers and 20 devices show DSAC outperforms Proximal Policy Optimization method and the REINFORCE mehtod, and performs comparably to D3QN with a long short term memory component, which uses a more complex network. These results demonstrate DSAC’s efficiency and suitability for dynamic, decentralized IIoT task scheduling, making it a promising approach for future edge computing systems."

Formulas have been derived that determine the energy of an electron and the average rate of increase of its thermal energy both within the framework of a non-resonant \"collisional\" model of microwave radiation energy absorption by plasma and within the framework of a resonant \"collisionless\" model in the electron cyclotron resonance zone. The threshold value of the electric field strength of the microwave discharge and the microwave generator power required to ignite and maintain the discharge are determined.

The ST inversion commonly applies linear regression method that account primarily for shipborne bathymetry errors, while often neglecting the potential uncertainties in altimetry-derived gravity data. To address this question, we draw on the idea of total least squares, which has been widely applied in numerical analysis. In this study, we propose an improved linear regression framework for ST inversion: we use high-precision multibeam shipborne bathymetry data (MSB1) as a constraint to iteratively determine the optimal weight ratio between bathymetry and gravity data, and subsequently construct initial weight matrices; then the Robust Weighted Total Least Squares (RWTLS) method is applied to estimate regression parameters, and the corresponding ST model is constructed. A case study is conducted in a region of the South China Sea (113°∼118°E, 13°∼19°N). Comparisons with the check data (MSB2) and existing models (topo_27.1, ETOPO2022, and SDUST2023BCO) indicate that the overall accuracy of the constructed ST model is approximately 150 m. And compared with traditional method, the application of RWTLS improves ST inversion accuracy, with power spectral density analysis further revealing a significant enhancement in topographic energy within the 12∼30 km wavelengths. Moreover, we find that the improvement in ST accuracy is mainly concentrated in offshore waters; in these areas, altimetry-derived gravity data tend to have greater uncertainty, nevertheless, the improved method effectively enhances the reliability of ST modeling by jointly accounting for the errors in both bathymetry and gravity data. This study proposes a robust inversion framework that considers multi-source data uncertainties, offering a novel strategy for robust linear ST modeling."

    "abstract": "Large-scale distributed wireless networks provide infrastructure-free and cost-effective connectivity, supporting applications from disaster recovery to global digital inclusion. However, multi-hop communication introduces scalability challenges, as point-to-point (P2P) capacity decreases with the number of intermediate relays (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hop count</i>). The growth rate of the expected <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hop count</i> with network expansion is primarily governed by the underlying interaction patterns among network users. Thus, this study focuses on the critical role of multi-hop communication and user interaction probability, which empirical evidence shows it decays as a power law with geographic distance. We present a comprehensive analysis of network scalability, from capacity estimation to empirical evaluation of real-world interaction patterns. The capacity estimation problem is decomposed using a novel analytical methodology, along with symmetric topology selection and geometric partitioning, to overcome the complexities inherent in previous models. The estimated P2P capacity bounds, derived from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">expected</i> hop count, surpass previous benchmarks. Specifically, when the power-law exponent exceeds a critical threshold, the expected hop count remains stable and P2P capacity is sustained; otherwise, the hop count grows and capacity declines as the network scales. Accordingly, an analytical method is devised to relate real-world interaction patterns to the power-law exponent, quantified by the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">contact distribution</i>.

Consequently, multi-hop communication does not fundamentally hinder the wide-scale deployment of distributed wireless networks. This capacity-based analysis provides a clear perspective on scalability under realistic interaction patterns and underscores the promising future of such networks, as well as their potential for widespread deployment."

To address these limitations, we We present ChatKID, an identity-based group key distribution protocol. At the architectural level, ChatKID employs an asymmetric design to address the resource imbalance between the group owner and group members in group key distribution. At the technical level, it develops a novel polynomial-based key derivation method that drastically improves key update efficiency, while its compliance with the SM9 cryptographic standard enables easy integration with numerous systems. We provide formal analyses of correctness and security, including resilience against five common attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle, replay), and achieve forward and backward secrecy. Subsequently, we compare ChatKID with recent protocols and demonstrate its significant advantages in both storage and communication overhead. Notably, for group members—typically resource-constrained mobile devices—ChatKID reduces overhead by one to two orders of magnitude (i.e., to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1/10\\sim 1/100$</tex-math></inline-formula>) compared to others. Furthermore, we compare ChatKID with mainstream instant messaging applications and demonstrate advantages in terms of connection dependency, computational overhead, communication overhead, and storage requirements. Finally, simulation experiments indicate its superior performance in typical instant messaging scenarios. Taken together, these results suggest that ChatKID holds significant promise for advancing group key distribution in real-world instant messaging applications."

    "abstract": "The evolution beyond the Fifth Generation (5G) of mobile communications systems is expected to exploit different advanced radio access techniques, such as distributed multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) or network slicing, together with an extensive support of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions for different aspects of network optimization. These systems will also benefit from the evolution of edge computing technologies through the availability of computing and storage capabilities that will span from the radio access network nodes to the cloud, forming an edge-to-cloud compute continuum. The availability of these features will provide the beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks with an increased flexibility for deploying the different AI/ML-based optimization functionalities, trading-off aspects such as delay requirements, computational complexity or availability of data for feeding the AI/ML models. In this context, this paper takes as a reference the evolved edge computing architecture of the VERGE project and presents a pipeline with the required functionalities for the lifecycle management of AI/ML models in edge-enabled B5G systems. This pipeline is particularized for the deployment of two specific AI-driven solutions used for capacity sharing in network slicing and for D-MIMO power control."

With varied parameter settings, DUCA and Pro-DUCA not only extend a collection of existing consensus optimization methods to solve the dual problem that they used to be inapplicable to, but also aid in offering new efficient algorithms to the literature. The proposed unified algorithms are shown to achieve <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(1/k)$</tex-math></inline-formula> convergence rates in terms of optimality and feasibility, providing new or enhanced convergence results for a number of existing methods.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the event-triggered adaptive control problem with a global fixed-time prescribed performance function (PPF) for the thermoacoustic system with multiple acoustic modes and multiple time delays nonlinear flame response coupling characteristics. First of all, the acoustic model coupled with the flame response subject to multiple unknown time delays is presented to describe the general thermoacoustic systems. Subsequently, an adaptive controller is proposed within the fully actuated system (FAS) framework, thereby ensuring the stability of the thermoacoustic system. Next, by constructing a global fixed-time PPF, the dynamic constraint on the system output pressure is achieved, ensuring that its transient and steady-state performance indicators meet the design requirements. What's more, an event-triggered scheme (ETS) optimized in collaboration with the global fixed-time PPF is proposed, which significantly reduces the frequency of actuator actions and communication resource consumption while maintaining the system transient performance. Furthermore, the FAS architecture is employed to design the controller, which effectively avoids the non-differentiability issue of the virtual control at event-triggered instants. Finally, simulation studies verify the superior performance and practical feasibility of the proposed controllers."

    "abstract": "Falls pose a significant risk to the lives and independence of elderly individuals, raising widespread concern in public healthcare. Timely and accurate prediction of fall events prior to impact is essential for enabling effective interventions and minimizing potential injuries. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Graph Convolutional Network (Uni-GCN) that simultaneously performs skeleton-based pose prediction and fall detection within a multi-task learning framework. The proposed model captures both spatial and temporal dependencies in human motion through a shared graph-based encoder, followed by two task-specific decoders for future pose prediction and fall classification. A unified loss function is introduced to jointly train both tasks, combining prediction loss and classification loss in a mutually beneficial manner. Additionally, we employ a two-stage transfer learning approach to address the challenge of limited data in fall datasets, by pretraining the model on large-scale datasets and fine-tuning it on fall-specific data. Experimental results on public fall datasets Le2i, URFD, and UP-Fall demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 99.15%, 99.42%, and 99.96%, respectively. Notably, our system is capable of predicting fall events approximately 480 milliseconds before impact, enabling proactive response. In addition, we deploy our model on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super edge device, validating its real-time performance and feasibility for deployment in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "With the rising global cancer incidence, addressing cancer has become a major international priority. Efficient cancer treatment methods are in high demand. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an effective targeted treatment for cancer. The tunable beam-shaping assembly significantly enhances the versatility of BNCT. In practical applications, measuring clinical parameters at the aperture is a complex and time-consuming task. However, measuring these parameters is necessary as they are more intuitive and ensure that treatment plans are set without errors compared to neutron energy spectra. In this work, we propose a method for predicting clinical parameters, such as advantage depths, defined as the depth at which the tumor-to-normal tissue dose ratio reaches unity, based on neutron energy spectra using backpropagation (BP) neural networks. It can quickly analyze neutron energy spectra within a short time. The models exhibit excellent convergence during the training process. Upon validation with the datasets, the predicted results closely match the calculations from PHITS. Moreover, when applied to actual beam-shaping assembly (BSA) designs, whether involving Li targets or Be targets, the models demonstrated high accuracy in their predictions. The time required for predictions using the models is instantaneous compared to the time needed for Monte Carlo simulations. This method can be combined with neutron energy spectrum detectors to develop specialized instruments for measuring clinical parameters in BNCT, paving the way for the wider adoption."

A physics-consistent RHS model is established, and the information-theoretic dispersion is derived in closed form using the Mellin transform method, we derive a closed-form probability density function of the RHS-induced channel gain. Then, we apply second-order Taylor expansion and saddle point approximation to obtain analytical expressions for the mutual information and unconditional information variance, which explicitly capture the amplitude-induced anisotropic variance. Finally, leveraging the Berry–Esseen theorem, the closed-form achievability and converse bounds are established which quantify the impact of RHS design parameters, blocklength <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>, and average error probability ϵ on the rate. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that RHS reduces the variance of the effective channel power by 35–50% in required blocklength compared with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) under identical resource budgets. The findings identify RHS as a physically scalable and mathematically tractable architecture for short-packet 6G communication."

Unlike computationally intensive deep learning models, our approach does not require end-to-end training and leverages structural events in the data to efficiently identify informative subsequences. We validate our method on 47 univariate datasets from the UCR/UEA archive.

    "abstract": "In today’s world of interdependencies, hardware security is viewed as a crucial component in system designs and production. As Integrated circuits (ICs) become more complex with the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain, one of the significant threats to hardware security is the Hardware Trojans (HTs). Hardware Trojans are malicious alterations intentionally implanted into a circuit to compromise its performance, reliability or security. There are many Machine- Learning (ML) based hardware trojan detection techniques proposed over the years which yielded better results than traditional methods but they still continue to encounter challenges with ad-hoc feature selection, detection accuracy and black-box nature of machine learning models. The proposed work presents a comprehensive structure to detect HTs at the gate-level netlist using machine learning techniques based on Graph Learning (GL). To overcome constant feature engineering associated with structural features, the gate-level-netlist is converted into Data Flow Graph (DFG) from which structural and graph centrality measures are extracted along with functional features thereby considering heterogenous features to increase the detection accuracy and coverage. It provides efficient techniques to overcome ad-hoc feature selection by incorporating techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) where they also contribute towards the explainability of the blackbox model’s interpretations serving dual purpose. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is used as a classifier. The experimental results projected that the proposed SHAP based XGBoost model evaluated on combinational circuits from TrustHUB benchmarks achieves a remarkable accuracy of 99.16%."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of mass appraisal of market value. In the context of developed markets, numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of distinguishing, among all characteristics describing the object of valuation, those factors that are suitable for solving the classification task, while the remaining pricing factors are used to solve the regression task – namely, estimating the most probable price. Despite the demonstrated efficiency of this multi-model approach, there is no widely accepted methodology for separating descriptive features into classification and pricing categories. The aim of this study is to scientifically substantiate the effectiveness of decomposing features into classification and pricing groups through statistical analysis of expert assessments of feature importance. The hypothesis tested in this study suggests that features with high importance (as determined by mean, median, or mode) and high dispersion (i.e., a high coefficient of variation) should be treated as classification factors, whereas features with high importance and low dispersion should be treated as price-forming factors. Materials and Methods. Passenger vehicles are selected as the objects of valuation. The vehicle database used for developing mass appraisal models contained three million records. To assess the influence of various vehicle parameters on price, a survey was conducted among 18 experts – professional market participants. The mean, median, and mode of expert assessments were used to rank the importance of the factors, while variance and coefficient of variation were applied for feature decomposition. A variety of mass appraisal models were developed using both classical regression methods and machine learning techniques (gradient boosting, random forest, and artificial neural networks), with and without the separation of pricing factors. Results. The models that incorporated the separation of pricing factors demonstrated an average increase of 5–7% in the coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) compared to models that used all features as a single set. Conclusion. The proposed approach to mass appraisal can be adapted to other types of valuation objects. The method based on statistical analysis of expert evaluations of feature importance is of a universal nature. This defines its practical significance, as appraisers and analysts in various domains often face substantial resource demands – time, computational, human, and financial – for constructing reliable mass appraisal models of market value."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and validation of a smart buoy prototype, built on a compact computing platform and an integrated set of acoustic, atmospheric, and pressure sensors. The system is intended for real-time monitoring of environmental parameters relevant to maritime security, ecosystem protection, and the management of critical offshore infrastructure. Experimental trials demonstrated the device's capability to record variations in temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as to detect nearby objects and predefined acoustic signals associated with potentially hazardous scenarios. Comparative analysis against reference values highlighted a concordance of 93.6% for atmospheric measurements and 91.3% for acoustic detections, confirming the system's reliability under real operating conditions. The results validate the concept of a modular and autonomous buoy, offering practical applications for maritime monitoring and the prevention of critical events."

    "abstract": "Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to robustly interpret highly cluttered, and complex real-world images and scenes. To enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks."

The algorithm computes magnetomotive force, flux density, and surface current density, verifies rotor torque against impeller demand, and then uses pressure–flow calculations to obtain lift height and discharge. Simulations with field-typical parameters indicate continuous irrigation with reduced energy use versus conventional operation, enabling real-time PV irrigation control in high-insolation regions (e.g., Fergana Valley)."

    "abstract": "Congestion control (CC) is a critical technology for improving the performance of data center networks with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). Existing end-to-end CCs find appropriate congestion signals and calculate the congestion window size based on the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) model. Custom host protocol stacks and Inband Network Telemetry (INT) enable CCs to leverage congestion signals that reflect more comprehensive network status. However, these CCs still face a long time for draining up queues, link underutilization, and frequently tuning several hyperparameters. We attribute these issues to the limitations of the AIMD model and the reliance on time-varying congestion signals. An ideal CC should drain queues and fully utilize link capacity at each decision point. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel congestion control algorithm called FCC, which achieves per-flow fairness and efficiency within one control loop without tuning any hyperparameter. FCC collects per-hop flow information through INT, optimizes link utilization based on a fair bandwidth allocation model, and drains the queue by a time-invariant congestion signal. Our evaluations show that FCC reduces the flow completion time (FCT) of short flows by up to 86 %."
