    "abstract": "This paper documents our efforts in releasing the printed and audio book of the translation of the famous novel The Little Prince into the Chakavian dialect, as a computer-readable, AI-ready dataset, with the textual and the audio components of the two releases now aligned on the level of each written and spoken word. Our motivation for working on this release is multiple. The first one is our wish to preserve the highly valuable and specific content beyond the small editions of the printed and the audio book. With the dataset published in the CLARIN.SI repository, this content is from now on at the fingertips of any interested individual. The second motivation is to make the data available for various artificial-intelligence-related usage scenarios, such as the one we follow upon inside this paper already -- adapting the Whisper-large-v3 open automatic speech recognition model, with decent performance on standard Croatian, to Chakavian dialectal speech. We can happily report that with adapting the model, the word error rate on the selected test data has being reduced to a half, while we managed to remove up to two thirds of the error on character level. We envision many more usages of this dataset beyond the set of experiments we have already performed, both on tasks of artificial intelligence research and application, as well as dialectal research. The third motivation for this release is our hope that this, now highly structured dataset, will be transformed into a digital online edition of this work, allowing individuals beyond the research and technology communities to enjoy the beauty of the message of the little boy in the desert, told through the spectacular prism of the Chakavian dialect."

    "abstract": "This paper elaborates on the implications of the relationship between the Second and Third Laws and provides a comprehensive formal and historical justification for the logical redundancy of the Nernst heat theorem. By revisiting the Nernst-Einstein debate, the underlying hypotheses that lead to the traditional view of the Third Law as an independent postulate are examined. It is argued that the historical rejection of Nernst's proof -- motivated by Einstein's insistence on the practical non-performability of cycles at absolute zero -- overlooks the fact that a universal Second Law already precludes such cycles, rendering an independent Third Law an unnecessary complexity. Ultimately, the Nernst theorem is shown to be an essential consistency regulator rather than an independent physical discovery."

    "abstract": "Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI."

    "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation."

    "abstract": "The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \\textbf{ARM} (\\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \\textbf{R}otation-aware \\textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation."

    "abstract": "This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users."

We investigate how maternal breastfeeding during this period has shaped offspring health and human capital outcomes in the UK. We use a within-family design, comparing children who were breastfed to their sibling(s) who were not. Our results show that breastfeeding increases adult height, as well as fluid intelligence, but does not affect educational attainment, nor adult BMI. In further analyses, we examine whether and how this impact varies with individuals' genetic \"predisposition\" for these outcomes, proxied by the outcome-specific polygenic index. We find that the \"height-returns\" to breastfeeding are larger among those genetically predisposed to be taller, with no genetic heterogeneity for the other outcomes, though we note that power in the within-family GxE analysis is more limited. Overall, our estimates suggest that breastfeeding plays a non-negligible role in child development."

However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU."

Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios."

    "abstract": "High-harmonic generation (HHG) from liquids offers a potential pathway to attosecond spectroscopy in chemically complex and disordered environments, yet fundamental questions remain open: whether liquid harmonic emission preserves well-defined attosecond synchronization, and whether harmonic emission can involve simultaneous contributions from multiple quantum trajectories with distinct excursion times despite strong disorder and scattering. Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG. All observations are well reproduced by semiclassical recollision simulations. These results place liquid HHG on the same conceptual footing as gas- and solid-phase HHG and establish a robust foundation for attosecond-resolved spectroscopy of ultrafast electronic and chemical dynamics in liquid environments."

While group algebras are known to be symmetric over any field, it is natural to ask whether this property extends to Hecke algebras. To study this, we introduce the new concepts of $p$-$S$-permutation groups (for a prime $p$) and $S$-permutation groups. A \\emph{ $p$-$S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group whose associated Hecke algebra is symmetric over every field of characteristic $p$. An \\emph{ $S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group that is a $p$-$S$-permutation group for all primes $p$. In this paper, we study Hecke algebras from a group-theoretical perspective and we show that several classes of permutation groups are $p$-$S$-permutation groups and $S$-permutation groups in our sense. This result represents a substantial extension of earlier work by Li and He.

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of turbulent skin-friction drag (TSD) generation is of fundamental and practical importance for designing effective drag reduction strategies. However, many previous studies adopted correlation analysis to reveal the causal map between turbulent motions and TSD generation, an approach that is potentially risky as correlation does not necessarily imply causation. In this study, a novel causal inference method called Liang-Kleeman information flow (LKIF) is utilized for the first time to identify the velocity-induced causal structures related to TSD generation in a turbulent channel flow. The statistical properties of the causal structures are comprehensively investigated. The positive and negative causal structures, defined by their signs and respectively associated with an increase and decrease in TSD information entropy, promote and suppress the generation of extreme TSD. Particularly, we find that the underlying physics of causal structures is essentially associated with the processes of streamwise streaks and rolls approaching or receding from the extreme events. Results indicate that the physics-informed LKIF framework can reveal a more explicit and interpretable causal relationship than correlation analysis."

While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoiréing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BinaryDemoire."

In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \\emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q>1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \\textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\\tilde{O} (K_P d/\\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\\tilde{O} (L_φd\\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $φ$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \\emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale."

Our algorithm promotes efficient exploration of the target distribution by combining global sampling mechanisms with a delayed weighting procedure. The proposed weighting mechanism plays a key role by enabling rapid resampling in regions where the proposal distribution is poorly adapted to the target. Our sampling algorithm is shown to be geometrically convergent under mild assumptions and is illustrated through various numerical experiments."

Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Stars with masses between roughly 1 and 8~$M_\\odot$ end their lives on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when intense mass loss takes place. The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira~A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira~A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5}~M_\\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200~years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira~A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $\\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\\times10^{-10}$, and $4\\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO. The strong variation in brightness of the different features identified in the polarized-light images is puzzling. We suggest that an asymmetric stellar radiation field preferentially illuminates specific regions of the circumstellar envelope at a given time, producing a lighthouse-like effect."

    "abstract": "Misinformation on social media poses a critical threat to information credibility, as its diverse and context-dependent nature complicates detection. Large language model-empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) present a promising paradigm that enables cooperative reasoning and collective intelligence to combat this threat. However, conventional MAS suffer from an information-drowning problem, where abundant truthful content overwhelms sparse and weak deceptive cues. With full input access, agents tend to focus on dominant patterns, and inter-agent communication further amplifies this bias. To tackle this issue, we propose PAMAS, a multi-agent framework with perspective aggregation, which employs hierarchical, perspective-aware aggregation to highlight anomaly cues and alleviate information drowning. PAMAS organizes agents into three roles: Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker. Auditors capture anomaly cues from specialized feature subsets; Coordinators aggregate their perspectives to enhance coverage while maintaining diversity; and the Decision-Maker, equipped with evolving memory and full contextual access, synthesizes all subordinate insights to produce the final judgment. Furthermore, to improve efficiency in multi-agent collaboration, PAMAS incorporates self-adaptive mechanisms for dynamic topology optimization and routing-based inference, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAMAS achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and trustworthy way for misinformation detection."

    "abstract": "Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures."

However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows."

Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training."

In this work, we study two approaches aimed at improving the symmetry properties of such an approximation scheme: one based on a quadrature rule for the Haar measure on the compact Lie group encoding the continuous symmetry of interest and one based on a random sampling of that Haar measure. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that the quadrature augmentation leads to exact symmetry preservation in polynomial models, while the random augmentation has only square-root convergence of the symmetrization error."

    "abstract": "AI agents that autonomously interact with external tools and environments show great promise across real-world applications. However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment.

While modified phase-field equations have been developed to mitigate volume loss, their effectiveness has not been systematically assessed in the context of fully developed turbulent flows. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of several representative volume-corrected phase-field models in direct numerical simulations of droplet-laden homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Our results reveal that, at sufficiently high Weber numbers, none of the existing models provides satisfactory droplet-volume preservation. To address this limitation, we then propose a simple yet effective modification of the conservataive Allen-Cahn equation by incorporating a curvature-dependent counter-diffusion correction. Direct numerical simulations in turbulent regimes demonstrate that the proposed model achieves conservation of droplet volume in a statistical sense, while avoiding common adverse effects, such as numerical instability, violation of global mass conservation, increased computational cost, artificial coarsening, or enhanced spurious velocities."

Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance (\"a bit more to the right\", \"now, stop.\") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios.

The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth in the parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has created a high demand for efficient compression techniques. As a hardware-agnostic and highly compatible technique, low-rank compression has been widely adopted. However, existing methods typically compress each layer independently by minimizing per-layer reconstruction error, overlooking a critical limitation: the reconstruction error propagates and accumulates through the network, which leads to amplified global deviations from the full-precision baseline. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), a LLMs compression framework that jointly optimizes intra-layer reconstruction and inter-layer error compensation. SAES-SVD is composed of two novel components: (1) Cumulative Error-Aware Layer Compression (CEALC), which formulates the compression objective as a combination of local reconstruction and weighted cumulative error compensation. Based on it, we derive a closed-form low-rank solution relied on second-order activation statistics, which explicitly aligns each layer's output with its full-precision counterpart to compensate for accumulated errors. (2) Adaptive Collaborative Error Suppression (ACES), which automatically adjusts the weighting coefficient to enhance the low-rank structure of the compression objective in CEALC. Specifically, the coefficient is optimized to maximize the ratio between the Frobenius norm of the compressed layer's output and that of the compression objective under a fixed rank, thus ensuring that the rank budget is utilized effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures and tasks show that, without fine-tuning or mixed-rank strategies, SAES-SVD consistently improves post-compression performance."

In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent.

At larger heights, diffracted fields from the square edges dominate and convert the lattice into a Bloch-type configuration. Over a range of intermediate heights, crossover between the evanescent SPP and edge diffraction gives rise to rich rapid topology evolutions. The switching is accompanied by nucleation of off-boundary vortex-anti vortex pairs in the in-plane spin phase, producing height-dependent fractional site charges. Our findings are analytically formulated by linear superposition of SPPs in the plasmonic regime and Stratton-Chu model in diffraction regime and confirmed via full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulations."

Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$ interfaces. The roughness is modeled as a Gaussian random field characterized by two parameters: the root-mean-square roughness amplitude $σ$ and the transverse correlation length $ξ$. These parameters are extracted from the literature and molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $σ$ and decreases slightly with $ξ$, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $σ$ and $ξ$. These results paint a quantitative and intuitive picture of Josephson energy variability induced by surface roughness, with direct relevance for junction design."

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to $19.36$% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks."

    "abstract": "We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at $z_{\\rm grism}=5.58$. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\\rm spec}=3.2439\\pm0.0002$. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\\rm 1mm}=0.99\\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\\rm e,1mm}=0.73\\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\\pm0.01$ kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (log$M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}\\sim10.6$), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($τ_{\\rm dep} \\sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe."

In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget."

We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $α= -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys."

Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions. Our findings advance the understanding of wave-mediated thermal transport in disordered photonic structures and suggest strategies for tailoring nanoscale heat management via engineered disorder."

The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can perform both communication and sensing tasks using the same frequency band and hardware, making it a key technology for 6G. As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs."

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090."

In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming critical infrastructure for enterprise applications, driving unprecedented demand for GPU-based inference services. A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \\emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \\emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics."

    "abstract": "High-fidelity digital twins rely on the accurate assimilation of sensor data into physics-based computational models. In structural applications, such twins aim to identify spatially distributed quantities--such as elementwise weakening fields, material parameters, or effective thermal loads--by minimizing discrepancies between measured and simulated responses subject to the governing equations of structural mechanics. While adjoint-based methods enable efficient gradient computation for these inverse problems, the quality and stability of the resulting estimates depend critically on the choice of sensor locations, measurement types, and directions. This paper develops a rigorous and implementation-ready framework for Fisher-information-based sensor placement in adjoint-based finite-element digital twins. Sensor configurations are evaluated using a D-optimal design criterion derived from a linearization of the measurement map, yielding a statistically meaningful measure of information content. We present matrix-free operator formulas for applying the Jacobian and its adjoint, and hence for computing Fisher-information products $Fv = J^\\top R^{-1} Jv$ using only forward and adjoint solves. Building on these operator evaluations, we derive explicit sensitivity expressions for D-optimal sensor design with respect to measurement parameters and discuss practical strategies for evaluating the associated log-determinant objectives. To complement the general framework, we provide analytically tractable sensor placement results for a canonical one-dimensional structural model, clarifying the distinction between detectability and localizability and proving that D-optimal placement of multiple displacement sensors yields approximately uniform spacing."

Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings."

TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task.

Motivated by these findings, we propose $\\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors.

Using the same set of laser beams as required for the initial Doppler laser cooling operation, we detune the laser frequencies to produce a narrow two-photon dark resonance. The process achieves a 1/e cooling time constant of 108(8) $μ$s, ultimately reducing the mean thermal axial mode occupation from 72(23) to 1.5(3) in 800 $μ$s as measured by resonantly probing an electric quadrupole transition near 729 nm. A parametric drive is applied to the trap electrodes which coherently exchanges the axial mode occupation with that of each radial mode, allowing for three-dimensional sub-Doppler cooling using only the axially-propagating laser beams. This sub-Doppler cooling is achieved for an axial oscillation frequency of $ω_z = 2π~\\times~$221 kHz, which places the motion well outside of the Lamb Dicke confinement regime at the Doppler laser cooling limit. Our measured cooling rate and final mode occupation are in good agreement with a semiclassical model which combines a Lindblad master equation solution for ion-photon interactions with classical harmonic oscillator motion of the trapped ion."

    "abstract": "Prior work on fairness in large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on access-level behaviors such as refusals and safety filtering. However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits."

Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify a number of point groups and 2D material candidates (e.g., BiF$_3$, ZnI$_2$, and Ru$_4$Se$_5$) that host this quantum Christoffel nonlinear magnetization. More importantly, this nonlinear magnetization allows the quantum Christoffel symbol to be probed by optical techniques such as magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy or transport measurements such as tunneling magneto-resistance. This quantum Christoffel nonlinear magnetization gives a paradigm of how geometry dictates physics."

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \\(O(|G| \\cdot |D|^6)\\), where \\(|G|\\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art."

    "abstract": "Unconventional superconductivity presents a defining and enduring challenge in condensed matter physics. Prevailing theoretical frameworks have predominantly emphasized electronic degrees of freedom, largely neglecting the rich physics inherent in the lattice. Although conventional phonon theory offers an elegant description of structural phase diagrams and lattice dynamics, its omission of nuclear quantum many-body effects results in misleading phase diagram interpretations and, consequently, an unsound foundation for superconducting theory. Here, by incorporating nuclear quantum many-body effects within first-principles calculations, we discover a lattice quantum disordered phase in superconductors H3S and La3Ni2O7. This phase occupies a triangular region in the pressure-temperature phase diagram, whose left boundary aligns precisely with Tc of the left flank of the superconducting dome. The Tcmax of this quantum disordered phase coincides with the maximum of superconducting Tc, indicating this phase as both the origin of superconductivity on the dome's left flank and a key ingredient of its pairing mechanism. Our findings advance the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity and establish the lattice quantum disordered phase as a unifying framework, both for predicting new superconductors and for elucidating phenomena in a broader context of condensed matter physics."

Motivated by the observation that the limit system is well-posed in Lp-based spaces for p\\in[2, \\infty), we extend the low-frequency analysis to this full range, thereby providing a more unified framework for studying such relaxation limits. The core of our proof consists in establishing refined product and commutator estimates describing sharply the interactions between the high, medium, and low-frequency regimes. A key observation underlying our analysis is that the product of two functions localized at low frequencies generates only interactions between low and medium frequencies, never purely high-frequency ones. Consequently, for a suitable choice of frequency threshold, the high-frequency projection of the product of two functions localized low frequencies vanishes."

We investigate the relationship of mm and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission with variations in the temperature and coronal plasma emission measure obtained from SDO/AIA and GOES data. The results show that the enhanced mm emission at the post-impulsive phase of the flare coincides with the increase of EUV emission, indicating a connection with moderately hot (~1 MK) plasma.

We present EarResp-ANS, the first system enabling fully on-device, real-time RR estimation on commercial earphones. The system employs LMS-based adaptive noise suppression (ANS) to attenuate ambient noise while preserving respiration-related acoustic components, without requiring neural networks or audio streaming, thereby explicitly addressing the energy and privacy constraints of wearable devices. We evaluate EarResp-ANS in a study with 18 participants under realistic acoustic conditions, including music, cafeteria noise, and white noise up to 80 dB SPL. EarResp-ANS achieves robust performance with a global MAE of 0.84 CPM , reduced to 0.47 CPM via automatic outlier rejection, while operating with less than 2% processor load directly on the earphone."

    "abstract": "In this work, we study sequential contracts under matroid constraints. In the sequential setting, an agent can take actions one by one. After each action, the agent observes the stochastic value of the action and then decides which action to take next, if any. At the end, the agent decides what subset of taken actions to use for the principal's reward; and the principal receives the total value of this subset as a reward. Taking each action induces a certain cost for the agent. Thus, to motivate the agent to take actions the principal is expected to offer an appropriate contract. A contract describes the payment from the principal to the agent as a function of the principal's reward obtained through the agent's actions. In this work, we concentrate on studying linear contracts, i.e.\\ the contracts where the principal transfers a fraction of their total reward to the agent. We assume that the total principal's reward is calculated based on a subset of actions that forms an independent set in a given matroid. We establish a relationship between the problem of finding an optimal linear contract (or computing the corresponding principal's utility) and the so called matroid (un)reliability problem. Generally, the above problems turn out to be equivalent subject to adding parallel copies of elements to the given matroid."

    "abstract": "While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, \"sliceable\" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

D3PIA incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment. This design enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. We evaluate our model using the POP909 dataset, a widely used benchmark for piano accompaniment generation. Objective evaluation results demonstrate that D3PIA preserves chord conditions more faithfully compared to continuous diffusion-based and Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, a subjective listening test indicates that D3PIA generates more musically coherent accompaniments than the comparison models."

To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly. Our code is available at https://github.com/aintdoin/FaithRL."

However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline."

    "abstract": "Malware detection and classification into families are critical tasks in cybersecurity, complicated by the continual evolution of malware to evade detection. This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis."

    "abstract": "LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter."

Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analysis suggests that LiMgZr2H12 reaches a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 60.8 K at ambient pressure. Compared with MgZrH6, Li doping significantly increases the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the electron density of states near the Fermi level (EF) and enhances the EPC constant of the LiMgZr2H12 structure.

However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings."

    "abstract": "Code generation has advanced rapidly with code-focused large language models (LLMs), especially on snippet-level tasks. However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests. We release RAL-Bench at https://github.com/Wwstarry/RAL-Bench. ."

    "abstract": "Warm Dense Matter lies at the frontier between condensed matter and plasma, and plays a central role in various fields ranging from planetary science to inertial confinement fusion. Improving our understanding of this regime requires experimental data that can be directly compared with theoretical and numerical models over a broad range of conditions. In this work, a pulsed-power experiment is described in which thin metallic foils, confined within a sapphire cell, are Joule-heated to achieve the expanded warm dense matter regime. Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities."

    "abstract": "Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize images that faithfully preserve the identities of multiple reference subjects while following textual instructions. However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency."

This study aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid electromagnetic (EM) simulation framework for efficient and accurate assessment of such interactions. Methods: A hybrid EM strategy integrating the Huygens' Box (HB) method with sub-gridding was implemented in an FDTD solver (Sim4Life). RF coil models for mouse and rat head were simulated with and without intracortical (IC) and epicortical (EC) graphene-based micro-transistor arrays. Three-dimensional multi-layered probe models were reconstructed from two-dimensional layouts, and transmit field ($B_{1}^{+}$), electric field ($E$), and specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions were evaluated. Performance was benchmarked against conventional full-wave multi-port (MP) simulations using Bland-Altman analysis and voxel-wise percentage differences. Results: HB simulations reduced computational time by approximately 70-80%, while preserving spatial patterns of $|B_{1}^{+}|$, $|E|$, and SAR, including transmit-field symmetry and localized high-field regions. Deviations from MP were minimal for $|B_{1}^{+}|$ (median $Δ$% 0.02-0.07% in mice, -3.7% to -1.7% in rats) and modest for $|E|$ and SAR, with absolute SAR values remaining well below human safety limits. Graphene-based arrays produced negligible effects on RF transmission and SAR deposition. Conclusion: The HB approach enables computationally efficient, high-resolution evaluation of EM interactions involving microscopic probes in MRI environments, supporting simulations that are otherwise impractical with full-wave MP modeling."

    "abstract": "To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking \"what kind of tone do you want?\" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines."

This implies that a condition \"the finite element space has to be sufficiently rich\" in the form of a resolution condition - typically imposed for discrete well-posedness - is not an artifact from the proof by a compact perturbation argument but necessary for discrete stability of the Galerkin discretization."

Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised object-centric learning models, particularly slot-based architectures, have shown great promise in decomposing complex scenes. However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

While hierarchical approaches mitigate this issue by decomposing tasks, most existing methods rely on separate high- and low-level networks and generate only a single intermediate subgoal, making them inadequate for complex tasks that require coordinating multiple intermediate decisions. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought paradigm and propose the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a novel framework that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given a state and a final goal, CoGHP autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by the primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step that conditions subsequent predictions. To implement this efficiently, we pioneer the use of an MLP-Mixer backbone, which supports cross-token communication and captures structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action. Across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks."

Most importantly, convergence and understanding of fundamental PPO advantages remain widely open. Under standard theory assumptions we show how PPO's policy update scheme (performing multiple epochs of minibatch updates on multi-use rollouts with a surrogate gradient) can be interpreted as approximated policy gradient ascent. We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success. Additionally, we identify a previously overlooked issue in truncated Generalized Advantage Estimation commonly used in PPO. The geometric weighting scheme induces infinite mass collapse onto the longest $k$-step advantage estimator at episode boundaries. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction can yield substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signal, such as Lunar Lander."

Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer.

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies."

The objective is to maximize the overall EE subject to constraints on the monostatic transmitter power budget, the minimum communication data rate, and the maximum allowable sensing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and challenging due to the fractional objective function and the unit-modulus constraints of the RIS coefficients. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient solution framework that combines Dinkelbach's method with error reformulation techniques to transform the problem into a more tractable form. We then apply the successive convex approximation approach within each iteration to handle the non-convex components, yielding a computationally efficient solution.

Replicating a mixed- methods design, the proposed study explores the effects of the divergent degrees of brand awareness on the consumer buying behaviour, loyalty and repeat purchase behaviour. The machine learning analytical tools utilize the ability to analyze large amounts of data to identify minute trends and predictive indications that historic methods might miss. The focus is on the role of digital marketing channels, such as social media platforms, where AI-based analysis of the sentiment and the engagement will present fine-grained views of consumer-brand interaction. The paper continues to analyze cognitive and emotional aspects of brand perceptions discussing the ways and dynamics of building loyalty. The outcomes demonstrate that brand recognition plays a key role in the purchase process and that conversational analytics supported by AI can streamline the segmentation of the audience, predict the purchase patterns, and channelspecific actions. The findings reaffirm the tactical value of incorporating AI in brand management with the view of promoting specific outreach, enhancing customer retention, and the ability to gain competitive advantage sustainably in a dynamic market. These insights can be useful in business, marketing and policies that are aimed at understanding the volatile relationships between brand awareness and consumer behaviour in an age of digitalization."

The proposed dynamic model is found to be in agreement with experimentally measured acceleration and strain signals in terms of both acceleration and outer race forces, thus validating its accuracy."

    "abstract": "Inverse photoemission spectroscopy is an important method for studying the surface electronic structure of materials. It can reveal the conduction band structure of a material. Combined with photoemission spectroscopy, complete electronic structure information can be obtained. Therefore, it is a crucial scientific instrument for characterizing the detailed electronic structure of a material across energy bands. In recent years, with the continuous advancement of materials science and surface physics, the demand for high-resolution inverse photoemission spectroscopy has continued to increase. This thesis first introduces the basic theory of inverse spectroscopy. Then, a high-resolution inverse photoemission spectroscopy system based on a sector-shaped deflection energy analyzer and a monochromator was designed, and its theoretical energy resolution was calculated. Finally, future research priorities for inverse spectroscopy are outlined to provide a reference for subsequent related research."

Scratch card-based IFAT® was developed by Epstein and made available to the teaching community through a commercial channel. Despite several advantages, grading using IFAT® cards for a final exam of a typical first-year course requires several manual hours. To ease this tedious process, this paper discusses an automated approach for grading exams conducted using scratch card-based IFAT. An algorithm that uses the OpenCV image processing library that can detect scratched, unscratched, and varying degrees of partially scratched boxes with high accuracy has been developed and implemented to create a logical representation of the IFAT® card. Our tool demonstrated a high degree of precision (>99%) for an assessment involving 39 cards of 10 questions, each with 5 scratch boxes."

Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) reduces this burden using image-level labels, but existing methods based on Class Activation Maps (CAM) often capture only small discriminative object regions, yielding incomplete pseudo masks. We introduce a CAM-SAM fusion framework that combines the semantic cues of CAM with the strong boundary localization capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Specifically, we propose Semantic-Aware Prompting (SAP), where highresponse CAM peaks to guide SAM in generating detailed masks, and a Mask Fusion Algorithm that intelligently integrates CAM and SAM outputs to produce reliable pseudo labels. Evaluations on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show that our method produces sharper and more complete masks, leading to significant improvements in segmentation accuracy over CAM-only baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating foundation models into WSSS for high-quality segmentation with minimal supervision."

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection is a core task for ensuring the stability of modern industrial, financial, and operational systems. However, most existing methods model data in the time domain, which presents challenges in capturing global periodic anomalies and subtle structural changes, and they are susceptible to local noise. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for anomaly detection named Multivariate time frequency anomaly detection(MTFAD). The core idea of MTFAD is to shift the main analysis process from the traditional time domain to the frequency domain. Specifically, the framework first maps the input sequence to the frequency domain via Fourier Transform and innovatively introduces a Frequency Patching strategy to decompose the spectrum into multiple frequency patches representing different frequency bands. The model's training is jointly supervised by a time-frequency dual-loss function, ensuring consistency in both the waveform and spectral structure of the reconstructed signal. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that MTFAD can effectively identify diverse anomaly patterns and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods on several key metrics, providing a new perspective for time series anomaly detection by combining time and frequency domains."

Moreover, intelligent emotion prediction enhances adaptability and responsiveness in brain-computer interface systems, thereby improving the efficiency of human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid deep learning model for emotion detection using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The framework first performs optimal channel selection, followed by the extraction of band power features from four EEG frequency bands. The resulting feature sets are then used to validate One-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long-Short Term Memories (LSTM), and a hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM model using 5-fold cross-validation. Among them, the 1D CNN-LSTM model achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 95.00 %, precision of 95.93 %, recall of 95.07 %, and an F1-score of 95.50 % for arousal classification. Similarly, this model achieves an accuracy of 94.85 %, precision of 95.12 %, recall of 95.02 %, and an F 1 -score of 94.95 % for valence classification. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework offers a robust and generalizable solution for emotion recognition, making it a promising approach for practical applications."

    "abstract": "Smart Dynamic Wireless Charging Lane for EVs Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining global momentum; however, long-distance travel remains limited due to insufficient access to fast-charging infrastructure, particularly in highway and remote settings. Additionally, high ambient temperatures in regions like the GCC increase battery drain due to air conditioning loads, further exacerbating range anxiety. This research proposes a smart dynamic wireless charging lane that enables continuous inductive power transfer to EVs during motion, powered by a hybrid renewable system combining solar panels and hydrogen fuel cells. The embedded transmitter coils, designed with a switching frequency of 85–150 kHz, are capable of achieving up to ∼85% power transfer efficiency at standard highway speeds (60 km/h). The system architecture includes a mobile application for real-time energy monitoring and lane interaction, integrated with the vehicle via onboard receivers. The energy management strategy prioritizes solar input where available, with hydrogen storage units serving as backup to ensure reliability in low-radiation conditions. The system is capable of supplying a net SoC gain of 17–21% over a 2 km lane segment at 60 km/h, extending vehicle range by up to ∼120 km in emergency or off-grid environments. Safety measures include insulated coils and authenticated EV access control to ensure user protection and system integrity. This approach minimizes reliance on centralized grid infrastructure by decentralizing energy delivery and enhances EV usability in infrastructure-constrained regions. The proposed system aligns with national sustainability and smart mobility objectives, contributing to reduced emissions and increased renewable energy utilization."

This paper introduces the Contrastive and Reinforcement-enhanced Summarization System (CSRS), a novel hybrid framework that integrates contrastive semantic pretraining with reinforcement learning optimization to enhance summary fidelity and factual consistency. The model first employs a contrastive alignment module to maximize semantic coherence between the source and target summaries, followed by a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes task-specific rewards based on ROUGE-L, factual consistency, and coherence metrics. Experiments conducted on ArSumNews and Arabic Gigaword datasets demonstrate that CSRS achieves a ROUGE-L score of 43.12, outperforming AraBART and AraT5 by 3.6% and 2.8%, respectively, while improving BERTScore (F1) to 88.4. Furthermore, contrastive pretraining reduces semantic drift by 15% compared with conventional cross-entropy training. These results confirm the effectiveness of integrating semantic representation learning with reward-based optimization, offering a robust, contextually faithful, and human-oriented summarization framework for Arabic. The proposed CSRS sets a new benchmark in Arabic abstractive summarization and provides a foundation for future multimodal and crosslingual extensions."

We consider a typical shallow-water propagation model, where the rich position information embedded in multipath delays and amplitudes offers the potential to achieve the above purpose. Specifically, we exploit the frequency-domain input-output relationship of pilot subcarriers to construct a measurement model and incorporate joint processing of multiple OFDM symbols to enhance localization performance. To characterize random fluctuations in path gains caused by scattering from the rough surface and bottom, we introduce the Rician fading model. Under this assumption, each complex path amplitude comprises a deterministic component associated with the source position and a random perturbation. To fully leverage the parametric model, we adopt the stochastic maximum likelihood principle. The resulting high-dimensional optimization problem is iteratively solved by the developed expectation-maximization-type algorithm. In addition, a stable initialization scheme is designed to strive for convergence to the global optimum. To quantitatively evaluate the sensing capability of the integrated system, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound on the mean square error of the localization result and elucidate the performance gain from the joint processing. For completeness, we also present a tailored communication processing chain for symbol detection. Simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing matched field processing-based positioning techniques."

Existing object encoding approaches typically rely on appearance-based representations, leading to poor performance in environments with multiple visually similar objects, which can compromise downstream task accuracy. Inspired by human perception of objects through both appearance and structure, we introduce DGOE, a novel object encoding method, which adopts a dual-graph embedding scheme. Rather than treating object representation as a single-level appearance encoding problem, DGOE explicitly models object discriminability through a dual-level structural formulation, decomposing it into intrinsic inner-object structure and cross-object relational context. DGOE leverages graph structures as the carrier to integrate object intrinsic appearance and cross-object spatial features. This unified framework leads to more distinctive and reliable object representations. Additionally, we use multi-head self-attention to learn cross-object graph structures for extracting cross-object spatial features. Experimental evaluations on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in object-level matching tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness."

The IERND is designed to enhance the noise tolerance in kinematic parameter learning.

Recently, processing-in-memory (PIM) has been getting increasing popularity as one of the emerging technologies for future computing with a focus on data-centric operations due to increasing applications which deal with large amounts of data. 2T DRAM has advantages at high-speed inference operations, cell scalability with truncation of the bulky capacitor, and full Si processing-capability, which makes the 2T DRAM PIM more favorable in chip implementation. However, the 2T DRAM cell has a weakness in that it is highly susceptible to coupling, because the storage node (SN), where data is stored, exists between the two transistors at floating state. This work investigates the cause of the CC and explains how to the precharge voltage is used to reduce the effect of CC in 2T DRAM. Furthermore, the disturbance based on the data stored in each cell of a 32 × 32 array is analyzed to determine its impact on read operations.

Model aggregation occurs automatically due to the superposition property of the wireless channel. We derive a novel upper bound on the convergence of the optimality gap of OTA-FL that applies to any choice of device transmit powers and receiver scaling. The bound is based on less restrictive assumptions compared to the literature. It leads to the insightful concept of an effective learning rate that captures the dependence of the convergence of OTA-FL on the gains of the channels between the devices and the parameter server. We jointly optimize the transmit powers and the receiver scaling to minimize the error floor implied by the bound while controlling the effective learning rate. This leads to a novel controlled descent algorithm (CDA) and a new variant that adapts the effective learning rate. CDA can be implemented using a low overhead protocol. We benchmark CDA against several transmit power, receiver scaling, and device selection schemes. For both linear regression and multi-class logistic regression, CDA requires fewer iterations and a lower sum energy to achieve a target optimality gap or testing accuracy."

    "abstract": "Data-driven methods enable online assessment of error states in magnetic-array-type current sensors, and long-term measurement stability can be enhanced through further self-error correction. However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as 2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup> in relative error and 2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup> rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor’s error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method."

    "abstract": "Needle-based interventions are routine in clinical practice, yet clinicians lack reliable, precise, real-time estimates of the tip-to-target distance—–a key determinant of safety and efficiency. To bridge this critical clinical gap, physics-based models that maps electrical bio-impedance (EBI) measurements to the absolute tip-to-target distance by leveraging tissue-intrinsic electrical properties encoded in EBI are presented in this work. A tripolar electrode configuration is adopted to ensure tool-independence and broad compatibility across instruments and anatomical sites. The optimal layout of electrode radius, inter-electrode spacing, and placement was identified through a systematic parametric study. The model was validated across finite-element simulations, saline solution experiments, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> layered tissue. In all settings, proximity distance estimates were accurate and robust across different insertion angles. In simulation, it achieved 0.55 mm RMSE/1.06 mm MAE when the target layer was less conductive than the first layer and 0.40 mm RMSE/1.21 mm MAE when it was more conductive. In saline, four insertion angles yielded millimeter errors with no angle dependence. In <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> layered tissue, accuracy remained near the millimeter level across angles (RMSE 1.00–1.13 mm and MAE 1.30–1.58 mm), which is slightly lower than saline yet consistent across orientations. Together, these results establish a general, instrument-agnostic framework for absolute proximity distance sensing during needle interventions with the potential to enhance safety and efficiency in minimally invasive procedures. Furthermore, by first focusing on a two-layer model, this work provides a clear pathway to multi-layer tissue modeling and broader anatomical generalization."

    "abstract": "Internal combustion engines have long been the backbone of mechanical motion in automotive and industrial systems. However, increasing focus on sustainable alternatives and the need to reduce carbon emissions has driven innovation in electromagnetically driven systems. This paper presents a simulation-based design of a V8 solenoid engine — a system that replaces conventional fuel-based combustion with electromagnetic linear actuators (solenoids) to mimic piston-like motion. Unlike traditional electric motors, solenoids offer high instantaneous torque and direct electromagnetic force application, making them suitable for high-load, low-speed applications such as educational EV prototypes or automation systems. The primary aim of this research is to explore the feasibility, energy efficiency, and mechanical performance of such a system through simulation tools. We use Proteus to simulate solenoid activation via control circuitry and Fusion 360 to model the mechanical components, including the pistons and crankshaft. By integrating circuit-level control with realistic mechanical modeling, this project bridges the gap between electronics and mechanical motion, serving as a proof-of-concept for solenoid-based engine alternatives in future electromechanical systems."

In this work, a compact two-port CP-DRA is modelled and refined in ANSYS HFSS for operation near 28 GHz to support 5G MIMO deployments. Circular polarization is accomplished through geometric shaping of the resonator and an offset ground aperture that excites orthogonal modes with approximately 90° phase separation. The realized design provides excellent impedance matching at 27.36 GHz(|S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</inf> | ≈ - 38 dB), an axial ratio under 3 dB, and inter-port isolation close to -30dB. The antenna features a broadside gain of 5.5 dBi while exhibiting greater than 95 % radiation efficiency. The associated diversity analysis revealed an ECC of <0.02, diversity gain of ~ 10 dB, and CCL of <0.1 bits/s/Hz. The innovation lies in the compact dual-feed architecture that maintains high isolation and stable circular polarization without additional decoupling networks. The findings corroborate that the suggested Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna (CP-DRA) presents an efficient and dependable platform for 28 GHz 5 G MIMO systems."

This choice yields strong perceptual obfuscation at low computational cost while keeping the encoder unmodified. By designing the scrambling in a precinct-wise manner aligned with the JPEG XS packetization, the impact on rate-distortion (RD) performance is minimized, preserving compression efficiency.

    "abstract": "The advent of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies in wireless communication systems has opened new frontiers for high-data-rate applications. However, mmWave signals are highly susceptible to atmospheric impairments, particularly rain attenuation, which significantly degrades system performance. This paper investigates the impact of rain attenuation on the efficiency of wireless communication systems operating in the mmWave band, focusing on frequencies ranging from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. A comprehensive analysis is conducted using empirical rain attenuation models, including the ITU-R P. 838 and P. 837 recommendations, to estimate the specific attenuation under various rainfall intensities. The study evaluates the effects of rain on signal degradation, link budget, and system availability. Simulation results demonstrate that rain attenuation introduces substantial signal loss, which can reduce link reliability and throughput in mmWave systems. Strategies such as adaptive modulation, power control, and site diversity are discussed to mitigate these effects. The findings underscore the critical need for robust design and planning of mmWave wireless links to ensure efficient and reliable communication in rain-prone environments."

The integrated decision making and planning approach captures the coupling between these two modules, offering enhanced interpretability and intelligence. However, in highly dynamic complex driving environments, existing integrated modeling approaches suffer from high time complexity or poor applicability. In this article, we present a soluble and intelligent framework called Integrated Decision Making and Planning (IDMP), which decompose the AD decision making and planning problem into two layers: optimal trajectory selection layer and optimal trajectory tracking layer. The optimal trajectory selection layer leverages historical planning information to predict the ego vehicle’s trajectory and employs a fast decision making strategy based on the predicted trajectory to select the optimal path, which is subsequently tracked to achieve a tightly coupled decision making and planning module. Based on these, we designed a closed-loop structure composed of upper-layer decision guidance and lower layer planning feedback. Finally, we validated the proposed framework through comparative experiments using the CARLA-SUMO simulation. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method has advantages in a series of complex autonomous driving scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of training data reduction in the Augmented Real-Valued Time-Delay Neural Network (ARVTDNN) on the performance of digital predistortion (DPD). The training data was reduced using two methods: one that removes samples based on a threshold applied to the envelope amplitude of the PA output signal, and another that employs random sampling. The resulting models were evaluated and compared in terms of Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics, demodulated signal constellations, and ARVTDNN training time, in order to identify the most effective reduction method. To compress the training data while minimizing degradation in model performance, it is important to extract samples with a well-balanced amplitude distribution. In particular, when the random sampling method was applied, it was confirmed that a 50% reduction in data resulted in only a 2.6 dB degradation in ACPR, while the training time was reduced by approximately 57.5%. This level of performance degradation remains within the acceptable range defined by the 3GPP standard (TS 38.104), demonstrating that the proposed method satisfies current regulatory requirements."

This paper presents an empirical investigation of a passenger weight detection system that uses air suspension and tire pressure sensors on an 18.75-meter articulated battery overhead bus. The focus is on measurements conducted at bus stops during typical operational cycles. Through static tests conducted in a workshop and on-route at-stop tests that simulated passenger events (20 kg to 80 kg), the performance of the system was evaluated under various conditions, including kneeling and vehicle pre-loading. The results demonstrate that the approach maintains a high level of accuracy for non-kneeling scenarios even on-route (e.g., 80 kg: MPE -0.24%, StdDev PE 1.02% for front entries). However, kneeling operations caused significant performance degradation, as initial events were obscured and measurement variability increased. While the tire pressure sensor showed a good averaged calibration fit, its single-event accuracy during on-route kneeling tests was limited (StdDev PE 8.32% for 80 kg). Pressure changes induced by passenger weight were notably modified in size by vehicle pre-loading, underscoring the necessity for adaptive calibration. While the research validates the potential of direct, pressure-based measurement systems for determining weight on-route, successfully deploying them in real-world conditions requires integrating advanced signal processing algorithms and self-adapting calibration protocols."

For this purpose, fast multi-tau correlators have been developed in dedicated hardware, in software, and on FPGAs. However, for methods such as X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS), which requires to calculate the autocorrelation function independently for hundreds of thousands to millions of pixels from high-resolution detectors, current approaches rely on offline processing after data acquisition. Moreover, the internal pipeline state of so many independent correlators is far too large to keep it on-chip. In this work, we propose a design approach on FPGAs, where pipeline contexts are stored in off-chip HBM memory. Each compute unit iteratively loads the state for a single pixel, processes a short time series for this pixel, and afterwards writes back the context in a dataflow pipeline. We have implemented the required compute kernels with Vitis HLS and analyze resulting designs on an Alveo U280 card. The design achieves the expected performance and for the first time provides sufficient throughput for current high-end detectors used in XPCS."

They are caused by sustained pressure, friction, and moisture on the skin, which causes tissue injury and infection if not treated promptly. Although different monitoring systems exist, most of them are expensive, do not provide real-time feedback, or monitor only specific parameters. All of them do not offer an all-around solution that incorporates motion, pressure, and environmental inputs, all of which are necessary in the early detection and prevention of pressure ulcers. In this study a sensor-based detection system for patient movement that uses Force Sensitive Resistors, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a motion sensor, all interfaced to an Arduino microcontroller and an LCD display for real-time monitoring is used. The system is designed to sound alarms in cases of prolonged pressure on body regions, prolonged inactivity in the patient's movements for some period, and when temperature and humidity levels rise beyond comfort zones. All the sensors operate cooperatively to determine quickly any factors that pose risk, with warning offered through buzzers and LEDs. The system effectively identified the high-risk condition and responded by sounding the alarm appropriately. The findings show the system to be capable of monitoring key changes in patient status so that caregivers can react in a timely manner. This project illustrates the potential of low-cost embedded systems to improve patient safety by preventing pressure ulcers through early intervention, thus enabling improved healthcare outcomes in clinical, elderly care, and home settings."

In practice, the effective boost inductance deviates from its nominal value due to tolerances, temperature, aging, and operating condition dependence. This degrades the MPCC current prediction and increases input current distortion, especially near the voltage zero crossing point. The proposed controller incorporates an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that estimates the inductance online at every sampling instant and injects it into the MPCC prediction model. A 2 kW FPGA-based TPPFC converter experimental setup is used to evaluate the method for two inductors (2.5/5.0 mH) and two load conditions (1/2 kW). Experimental results demonstrate that EKF-based inductance adaptation improves current prediction and sinusoidal current shaping without compromising power factor (PF) or efficiency. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical solution for accurate MPCC implementation in TPPFC converters."

Unlike conventional methods, our approach enforces a critical constraint ensuring the number of cluster transmit antennas exceeds user antennas, thereby guaranteeing sufficient independent spatial streams. Subsequent to cluster formation, we implement fully distributed power allocation, substantially reducing system overhead compared to centralized alternatives. We derive closed-form expressions for the average sum rate (ASR) and ergodic sum rate (ESR) lower bounds under distributed operation, and develop a graph convolutional network (GCN) power allocation algorithm. Simulation results validate the superiority of our approach."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an internal model control (IMC) strategy for an inverter-based autonomous microgrid (MG) considering time delay. The system is modeled with two parallel inverters connected with multiple linear loads and incorporates communication delay associated with measurement blocks. The IMC controller is properly tuned with the help of a filter. parameter and utilized to control active and reactive power sharing. Furthermore, the time delay is modeled using Pade. approximation and the test system is investigated with uniform and non-uniform delay. The key performance indicators, like Overshoot, steady-state accuracy, and settling time demonstrate that the IMC controller provides better mitigation of high-frequency oscillations under both uniform and non-uniform delay. The proposed model efficacy is compared with a conventional controller, and the results indicate that IMC application in distributed energy systems mitigates high-frequency oscillations associated with inherent time-delays."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an analysis of the dual role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of multimedia security, examining how these models can both strengthen defensive capabilities and introduce new vulnerabilities within modern content ecosystems. As LLMs increasingly interface with multimedia workflows-ranging from text-image generation pipelines to cross-modal retrieval and content moderation-their susceptibility to attacks such as data leakage, prompt injection, and jailbreaks raises critical concerns for the integrity and trustworthiness of multimedia platforms. We focus our analysis on privacy-oriented threats, including model inversion and membership inference, and discuss their implications for systems that process or generate multimedia content. Building on this risk landscape, we outline principles for improving the robustness and resilience of LLM-driven multimedia applications, highlighting strategies suited to in-the-wild threat scenarios. Indeed, we explore the constructive application of LLMs within cybersecurity frameworks, such as the Cyber Kill Chain, demonstrating how these models can be leveraged for threat detection, risk assessment, and automated defensive operations."

Prior solutions either fail to guarantee stall-free playback, introduce prohibitive overhead, or neglect prediction inaccuracies. We propose Opt360, a DASH-compliant optimization framework that generalizes tile assignment into multi-tier priority zones, incorporates prediction accuracy and window length directly into the optimization, and enforces hard constraints on stalls and quality switches. The resulting mixedinteger formulation, coupled with a segment-internal tile scheduler, adapts to diverse viewport models while remaining real-time feasible. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Opt360 ensures smooth playback, remains resilient to viewport variations, and effectively utilizes bandwidth for improved video quality, even under challenging network conditions."

    "abstract": "Critical workloads are stored in cloud data centers and require a continuous availability of the service; however, these telemetry streams are highly dimensional and complex, and it is difficult to perform timely anomaly detection. Old thresholding and linear statistical models are not always good at modeling non-linear dependencies and dynamic multitenant behavior, resulting in delayed or inaccurate alerts. To counteract these problems, a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) model is used to estimate heterogeneous cloud measurements in the form of hierarchical tensors and train compact latent images of normal operations. The CAE is that which makes use of dualpath convolutional encoding to make use of spatial-temporal correlations and probabilistic reconstruction-error modelling of adaptive thresholding. The framework was tested on large-scale datasets of Google Cluster Trace and Alibaba Cloud, scoring 97.4 % precision, 96.1 % recall, 96.7 % F1-score, and 0.985 AUC while maintaining an average inference latency of 180 ms and 2.1GB GPU memory. The results indicate the effectiveness of the method in real-time and scalable detection of anomalies and its possible impact on improving reliability and resilience in cloud data centers."

Their performance directly affects system efficiency, depending on parameters such as gain and input impedance matching with the rectifier circuit, which are essential for maximizing power transfer. The physical configuration of antennas must often be adapted to different environments and installation constraints. In this context, integrating antennas into window structures in buildings or vehicles presents a promising approach, offering a large surface area for energy collection without compromising usable space. To enable this integration while maintaining the optical properties of the window, this work investigates the use of glass as the dielectric substrate and a graphene-based film as the conductive element. Various deposition techniques for applying graphene onto glass substrates are evaluated, with emphasis on measuring electrical conductivity, and scattering parameters. These experimental results support the design of a patch antenna, optimized for operation at 5,8 GHz using CST Studio Suite software. A prototype is fabricated based on the selected graphene film, and its scattering parameters are measured and compared to both simulation results and to those obtained from a reference antenna of identical geometry using copper as the conductive material. This comparative analysis assesses the viability of graphene as a conductor in antenna applications."

The discussion covers their mathematical foundation in linear programming and duality, and shows how shadow prices on limits such as generation, ramping, transmission, reserves, and emissions reveal real-time and structural grid challenges. Practical uses include control room operations, flexibility procurement, planning, and carbon policy. The limitations and sensitivities of duals are outlined, and a roadmap is proposed for embedding them in India’s regulated SCED framework.

Reconstructed data thus obtained is subjected to a few ultrasound image processing techniques to generate final output images. These resulting images are then compared with those obtained using ground truth technique (i.e. full data based Delay and Sum (DAS) beamforming). We also applied recently proposed Frequency Domain Beamforming (FDB) technique on ARFI dataset (instead of DAS) for comparison and evaluation purposes.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based soft sensor technology plays an important role in industrial process monitoring, however anomalous data such as sensor faults and missing values can severely compromise the predictive performance and reliability of the models. Most existing approaches address only a single type of anomaly, making it difficult to cope with the complex scenarios of multiple coexisting anomalies in real industrial environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a unified two-stage data preprocessing strategy that integrates anomaly detection and isolation with data reconstruction. In the first stage, a parallel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Residual Network (ResNet) architecture is employed for fault detection and isolation to identify and separate abnormal data. In the second stage, an improved masked autoencoder model is applied to reconstruct the data at the detected anomaly positions, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of fault detection and data reconstruction across different anomaly magnitudes.

    "abstract": "Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion battery packs is essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of energy storage systems. However, the cross-domain transfer health prognosis from single cells to packs faces two major challenges: nonlinear and asynchronous degradation behaviors, and multimodal noises that violate the single-Gaussian assumption commonly used in traditional models. To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated framework for lithium-ion battery packs RUL prediction, synergistically combining an adaptive step-size differential model decomposition based on local curvature (ASDMD), and a Gaussian mixture model-based Unscented Transformation (GMM-UT). ASDMD adaptively regulates differential step sizes by local curvature estimation, ensuring the reduction of noise interference in smooth degradation phases and accurate capture of inflection points in steep degradation phases. GMM is employed to simultaneously model the statistical distributions of measurement noise and differential noise, while the UT realizes probabilistic propagation across domains. Three comparison methods are conducted to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improved prognostics performance for battery packs. In the migration prediction from battery cells to battery packs, the root mean square error for RUL prediction is less than 4 %, providing reliable guidance for maintenance scheduling and second-life utilization of battery systems."

Traditional imaging techniques, such as RGB (visual) and thermal imaging, each present unique strengths and limitations within SAR contexts. To determine the most effective approach, we evaluated RGB, thermal and multispectral image fusion image datasets using the YOLO algorithm and four distinct path planning algorithms to optimize SAR missions: Scanline Fill, Quadrant Scanline Fill, Geocentric Fill, and Random Fill. We define multi-spectral image fusion as overlaying RGB and thermal imagery, enabling a combined view that leverages both modalities.

    "abstract": "Turbochargers are widely used in highperformance internal combustion engine systems such as automobiles, aerospace, and marine applications. The floating ring bearing (FRB)-rotor system, as the core component, directly dictates turbocharger performance and durability. Its defining dual-oil-film structure enhances vibration damping on one hand, but simultaneously gives rise to significant nonlinear dynamic challenges, such as oil whirl, subsynchronous vibration, and bifurcation. A lubrication model for the FRB is developed based on the Reynolds equation with JFO cavitation boundary conditions. This model is then integrated with a finite element rotor model to establish a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of the turbocharger FRB-rotor system. Based on this, speed-up simulations were conducted for the system under balanced conditions and under different unbalanced conditions, systematically analyzing oil film instability behavior. The research results indicate that unbalanced excitation has a significant regulatory effect on oil whirl shedding, and the system may enter a chaotic state under specific operating conditions. Additionally, through methods such as waterfall plots, Poincare maps, and bifurcation analysis, the evolutionary of the system's nonlinear response was revealed. The findings deepen the insight into the physical mechanisms governing oil film instability in turbochargers, thereby contributing to the theoretical foundation needed for enhanced system design and more accurate vibration fault diagnosis."

Despite rapid advancements, most of the existing IRS researches still focus on a single-beam reflection. In this paper, a multibeam configuration for IRS is proposed, which is established based on 2-bit PIN diode unit cells with high reflectivity. Its reflection phase configurations are optimized by using genetic algorithm. To achieve the multi-beam operation, the IRS is configured by dividing into smaller sub-arrays, and each is independently configured to steer the reflected beam toward the desired direction. For computational demonstration, an IRS prototype composed of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$16 \\times 16$</tex> unit cells is characterized, which can yield 2, 3, and 4-beam steering with low side-lobe level.

    "abstract": "The Indian cities have established air pollution as a critical environmental and health concern which affects the entire nation. The study evaluates Bengaluru’s Air Quality Index (AQI) data from 2017 to 2024 through detailed timebased and statistical methods. The research demonstrates that air pollution levels reach their peak during winter months from December to February but decrease substantially during the monsoon period from June to August. The 2020 COVID-19 lockdown resulted in substantial reductions of AQI values because of reduced human activity. The highest pollution levels occurred in 2019, but the AQI readings stayed mostly between 75 and 135 which falls under the ‘Moderate’ category. The pollution levels show a pattern of higher readings on weekdays because of vehicle and industrial emissions. The research demonstrates how urban growth interacts with weather conditions and human-made pollution sources to produce air quality changes. The research findings establish a data-based framework which enables urban planners to create effective sustainable air-quality management strategies for Bengaluru"

The amplifying metasurface is designed based on a receiving, amplifying, and polarization-converted reradiating scheme. To ensure wideband performance, a cross-aperture coupled patch unit cell is meticulously designed. According to simulation results, the amplifying metasurface exhibits a gain variation between 0 and 14 dB within the 7.1-9.9 GHz. The designed amplifying metasurface is then fabricated as a prototype and experimentally measured. The experimental measurements demonstrate good agreement with the simulated results. With the increasing demand for the high-capacity network, the proposed amplifying metasurface aligns with the key requirements of future wireless systems, particularly in scenarios requiring dynamic coverage control and signal enhancement."

    "abstract": "The rise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is accelerating the growth of the low-altitude economy (LAE), enabling mobility beyond conventional ground-based transport. However, aerial vehicles or flying vehicles (FVs) in LAE environments face significant communication challenges due to high mobility, frequent handovers between base stations (BSs), and the susceptibility of mmWave bands to blockage and path loss. Reactive handover mechanisms—triggered only after link degradation—often lead to disconnections and degraded service quality, particularly in dense urban areas. Moreover, uneven FV distribution can cause BS load imbalances, further compromising quality of service (QoS). To address these challenges, we propose a proactive BS association framework for intelligent handover management using artificial general intelligence (AGI). Our approach leverages deep learning to jointly predict future received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and BS load, enabling an autonomous decision algorithm to select optimal BSs for stable, high-throughput connectivity while minimizing unnecessary handovers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint prediction-based strategy significantly reduces handover frequency and improves average throughput compared to reactive, single-metric base-lines and two additional benchmark predictors introduced for extended evaluation. These findings underscore the potential of predictive, AGI-driven mobility management to enhance the stability and performance of communication networks in the emerging LAE ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a secure approach to protecting client data privacy by remaining data local. However, semi-honest central servers expose clients to the risk of membership inference attacks (MIA). Differential privacy is often used to defend against MIA in FL, but the differential privacy-based federated learning (DP-FL) still faces the risk of privacy leakage for bit scenarios. This paper designs a novel neuron membership inference attack (NMIA) strategy under semi-honest central servers and bit scenarios, which can compromise DP-FL and obtain client privacy information. Specifically, NMIA generates an inference attack model with low computational overhead by training only in small-scale neurons. The attack model analyzes the gradient outputs of the FL clients and effectively infers information about specific client data. Sufficient conditions for the success of the NMIA have been theoretically proven. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the NMIA strategy in bit scenarios, two differential privacy protection methods for randomized response encoding applicable to federated learning for bit scenarios (BDP-FL) are proposed. Experimental results show that NMIA can easily defeat traditional DP-FL, achieving an attack accuracy of over 99%, while NMIA’s attack accuracy in bit scenarios is about 20% higher than the existing attack strategies. In addition, NMIA can still defeat the optimized encoding BDP-FL with an attack accuracy of up to 90%, while the symmetric encoding BDP-FL can only mitigate NMIA at the cost of severe FL utility loss."

This study innovatively integrated multi-source remote sensing parameters via Google Earth Engine to systematically compare three feature space models (Albedo-NDVI, Albedo-MSAVI, Albedo-KNDVI) and five machine learning algorithms for AD monitoring, while applying the Optimal Parameter Geographic Detector (OPGD) to quantify natural-anthropogenic driving mechanisms. High-resolution AD classification (5-year intervals, 2000–2020) revealed spatiotemporal dynamics, with machine learning models consistently outperforming feature space models. Random Forest (RF) achieved the highest accuracy (97.7%) and Kappa coefficient (0.967), effectively distinguishing non-desertified areas from extreme desertification. Temporal analysis showed a significant AD reversal: total desertified area declined to 30,166.35 km² by 2020, driven by ecological policies and climate amelioration. OPGD analysis indicated soil texture as the strongest single driver (q > 0.48), but factor interactions (e.g., SD ∩︀ LU) exerted greater explanatory power, highlighting compound effects of natural and anthropogenic factors. This study provides a robust framework for high-precision AD monitoring in semi-arid agro-pastoral zones, supporting global efforts toward zero land degradation."

Existing deep learning methods typically adopt fixed-depth architectures for all inputs, disregarding variations in structural complexity among varying targets. This results in redundant computation in non-target background and limited accuracy for specific types of underground targets. In response, we propose the Category-driven Depth-Scalable Inversion (CDSI) framework that integrates target classification with category-driven inversion. CDSI simultaneously extracts dynamic features (i.e., the wave changing information) via specific reservoir computing and captures spatial features through a convolutional network. A cross-attention mechanism fuses these features to predict the target category. Guided by the predicted category, a depth-scalable inversion network further adjusts its depth to reconstruct permittivity maps. Experimental results on synthetic 3D GPR datasets demonstrate that CDSI consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency."

In this paper, to facilitate circuit prototyping, a simplified configuration is considered, in which series capacitors are placed on both sides of the gyrators. The dispersion equation for this structure is derived, and numerical analysis shows that its characteristics closely match those of the original configuration over a wide frequency range, except near the higher cutoff frequency. Furthermore, since it has been confirmed that the dispersion diagrams of the E-CRLH-TL and the conventional CRLH-TL coincide under a specific structural condition, the simplified version is shown to maintain similar transmission performance while offering improved ease of implementation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a control strategy for small-scale photovoltaic (PV) inverters to introduce synthetic inertia into the power grid. As the participation of renewable sources increases and conventional synchronous generators decrease, grid stability may be affected since PV inverters lack inherent inertia. A current control model for the DC-Link is proposed to improve the inertia, integrating a two-stage single-phase inverter with a bidirectional boost converter and a battery bank. This system acts as a synthetic inertia source, using battery charge and discharge to smooth power transitions and enhance grid stability. Based on the Swing Equation of synchronous generators, the strategy implements a virtual inertia response, reducing oscillations and improving system dynamics. Simulations on a 3 kW inverter show improved response time and smoother transitions, indicating this approach is a promising solution to increase renewable energy integration while maintaining grid stability."

The growing use of VR applications to handle sensitive personal data necessitates the development of authentication methods that are both secure and practical.

This study presents the first VR authentication framework that integrates knowledge-based PIN entry with behavioral biometrics derived from cross-device input modalities, incorporating both controller and hand-tracking trajectories to enhance the security. We evaluate a Siamese network designed to process variable-length motion data using a pilot dataset of 26 participants performing four distinct PIN-entry tasks.

    "abstract": "Condition monitoring (CM) is vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of rotating machinery in industrial applications. Despite significant advances in signal processing and machine learning techniques, progress in CM research remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality degradation datasets. Acquiring such data, particularly for fault prognostics, faces multiple challenges. First, constructing an experimental test rig requires substantial investment and multidisciplinary expertise in mechanical design, control systems, and measurement technologies. Second, generating meaningful prognostic datasets demands large numbers of bearing failures under diverse operating conditions to adequately represent different degradation patterns. Third, the degradation process often takes several days to months, making it both time- and resource-intensive. As a result, few comprehensive datasets are publicly available due to commercial confidentiality and limited test capacities. To address these challenges and contribute to the CM community, we present the KU Leuven Bearing Prognostics Setup (KUL-BPS), a novel, modular, and cost-effective Accelerated Lifetime Testing (ALT) platform designed for systematic bearing degradation testing. Unlike existing ALT setups, which are often limited to low loads <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(&lt;10 \\text{kN})$</tex>, low speeds (<3000 RPM), or artificially induced faults, KUL-BPS offers several key advantages: (a) It supports high loads up to 35 kN and speeds up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$18,000 \\text{RPM}$</tex>, enabling realistic wear and fatigue processes; (b) It utilizes a robust self-aligning bearing, which is easy to install, inspect, and replace; (c) It allows experiments under both constant and time-varying load-speed profiles to reflect real-world operating conditions. Furthermore, KUL-BPS enables synchronized acquisition of multiple sensing modalities, including vibration, torque, speed, force, acoustics, displacement, and temperature, facilitating comprehensive CM studies. The platform also supports virtual sensing research, such as estimating internal forces or torques from indirect measurements."

This paper presents a rigorous technical analysis of the evolutionary pathway for TUoS charges, drawing upon well-established international benchmarks. Utilizing a comprehensive phased modeling approach—progressing from a simple postage stamp model to the current peak-coincident framework and finally to an advanced zonal pricing methodology—this study applies a simplified DC load flow analysis, executed in a Python environment, to a representative model of the Saudi national grid. The modeling results provide quantifiable evidence of significant locational disparities in network costs, demonstrating that a strategic transition to a zonal model would substantially enhance economic efficiency by providing transparent, cost-reflective signals to guide optimal generation siting and demand-side management. Furthermore, this analysis establishes a technically robust and defensible foundation for calculating precise wheeling charges between zones—an important institutional enabler for third-party market access and competition, in line with broader liberalization goals. This study also offers practical insights into how Saudi Arabia's tariff structures could align with global technical practices, helping to support the Kingdom's Vision 2030 objectives for economic and energy diversification. The analysis is conducted with full respect for the significant progress already achieved by the national utility and regulator, and is intended solely as a technical contribution to the ongoing dialogue on strengthening the Kingdom's energy sector governance for a sustainable and efficient future [1]."

In addition, Monte Carlo-based measures of risk including De-Risked Wind Power Availability (DWPA) and Weighted Annual Revenue Reliability (WARR) are employed to quantify the impact of uncertainty in the market returns. A case study of a 1 GW offshore installation off the coast of Tamil Nadu illustrates a mean capacity factor of about 48% and a levelized cost of energy of 65–75 USD/MWh.

The vibration measurement principle is derived in detail, and multiple experiments are conducted with sound sources placed up to 10 meters away. The results verify that the proposed method effectively acquires various types of sound signals at long range while maintaining robustness against environmental noise. This work demonstrates the feasibility of microwave-based acoustic sensing as a promising alternative to conventional methods for remote sound acquisition."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel control strategy for regulating the rotor speed of the Electromagnetic Frequency Regulator (EFR) in Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRESs), based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC). The EFR, which couples wind and photovoltaic sources through a single-stage power conversion system, requires accurate speed control to ensure stable output frequency in the synchronous generator. Unlike conventional Proportional - Integral (PI) controllers, which are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, ADRC actively estimates and compensates both internal and external perturbations, thus improving overall system robustness. Simulation results show that ADRC reduces speed oscillations by up to 80% during load variations and maintains frequency deviations within 2% of the nominal value, without overshoot. These results underscore ADRC's effectiveness in enhancing stability and power quality in hybrid renewable energy applications."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) have significantly impacted encrypted database management, particularly in secure data querying. However, FHE poses notable performance challenges, especially in processing aggregation queries. These challenges stem from the need to homomorphically evaluate selection predicates via a linear scan over encrypted rows and from the resultant accumulation of redundant data. Overcoming these limitations necessitates innovative solutions that transcend traditional FHE optimizations. We propose a scheme, named Accelerated Homomorphically Encrypted DataBase (AHEDB), to enhance the efficiency of aggregation queries in homomorphically encrypted databases. In the scheme, we employ Encrypted Multiple Maps (EMM) to reduce the computational load inherent in homomorphic operations, thereby achieving significant improvements over existing encryption schemes. We further introduce Single Range Cover (SRC) algorithm for range and equality indexing to address potential security vulnerabilities. We implement our scheme and conduct comparative analyses with FHE-based database system. Our experiments demonstrate that our scheme offers significant advantages in querying overheads, striking a balance between security and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Aerospace actuators must deliver high-speed, high-precision performance while withstanding extreme temperatures and environmental variations, which pose significant challenges to their positioning accuracy and reliability. To address these issues, this article proposes a fault decoupling and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for distributed piezoelectric stack actuators (PSAs), enabling self-diagnosis and self-recovery. A temperature perturbation observer (TPO) is designed to estimate temperature-induced disturbances, and a fault decoupling sliding mode observer (FDeSMO) is developed to decouple layer breakdown faults from lumped disturbances. The coordination between the two observers allows accurate detection of broken layers under temperature variations. Subsequently, a fault-tolerant controller is integrated to reallocate control signals and ensure system stability. Experimental results validate the proposed scheme, demonstrating its ability to detect fault and maintain reliability under the fault occurrence and temperature variation (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\textbf{19}\\!\\boldsymbol{\\sim}\\!\\textbf{60}\\,{}^{\\boldsymbol{\\circ}}\\textbf{C}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>).

At first, a multi-index evaluation system covering electrical and cooling characteristics is constructed, and the entropy weight method is adopted to determine the weights for comprehensive risk quantification. Secondly, a deep reinforcement learning model based on SAC is established to achieve dynamic risk prediction under continuous operating conditions. Finally, multi-scenario experiments and comparative analysis with other mainstream early-warning methods demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves effective early quench warning, with prediction errors consistently maintained within acceptable ranges."

However, transforming this data into a simulation-ready model is complex and time-consuming. This study introduces an automated framework to generate city-scale traffic simulation models using open data, including road networks, traffic signals, and vehicle volumes. Built on the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), the pipeline streamlines data processing and integrates real-world inputs into simulation components. The framework combines multiple open datasets through hybrid data synthesis, ensuring consistent road–signal coordination and enhancing traffic-flow realism and spatial resolution. Applied to a real urban center, the resulting models showed strong alignment with observed traffic patterns, supporting validity. As data collection, real-time monitoring, and spatial resolution advance, the framework’s applicability and precision will improve. By enabling efficient and reproducible model generation, this approach contributes to scalable traffic simulation and lays the groundwork for urban digital twin applications."

    "abstract": "Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control has long been the backbone of many industrial control systems due to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity of design, and robustness. Internal Model Control (IMC) is one of the most effective approaches for tuning PID controller parameters. Typically, first-order low-pass filters are employed in the IMC-based process control, where the filter has only one tuning parameter, namely closed-loop time constant, $\\lambda$. Even when a second-order filter is used, it still has only one tuning parameter. This study investigates the effect of second-order filtering with two userdefined parameters and employs analog filter denominator polynomials to determine the initial controller parameters. A novel second-order filtering model is proposed for first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) processes, and second-order low-pass Butterworth and Bessel polynomials are utilized to derive initial PID tuning parameters. The performance of the resulting controllers is evaluated through simulations in terms of setpoint tracking, load disturbance rejection, and robustness to model uncertainties for two FOPTD processes."

Traditional deep learning based perception systems, while powerful at detecting objects, often lack interpretability and fail to generalize in ambiguous or unseen conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Graph architecture that integrates neural perception with symbolic reasoning for context aware scene understanding. The system employs a convolutional vision model to perform object detection, distance estimation from raw driving footage. The extracted spatial information is then structured into a symbolic scene graph, where nodes represent entities such as vehicles, lanes and the camera mounted car. Edges in the graph encode spatial and semantic relations, including distance, lane occupancy and proximity warnings. This hybrid representation enables the system to infer high level contextual insights such as collision risk and optimal maneuver zones. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach supports interpretability, logical reasoning about spatial interactions."

    "abstract": "Traditional encryption techniques face serious threats from the rapid development of quantum computing, which could soon compromise many classical algorithms. To address this, new quantum-resistant security methods are needed to protect private data and communications. This paper proposes a hybrid encryption approach that integrates quantum key distribution (QKD) with a simplified 3×3 advanced encryption standard (AES) key matrix, creating a lightweight system. The objective is to provide an efficient encryption method suitable for devices with limited processing power, such as IoT devices. The model was simulated using Qiskit, achieving an average quantum bit error rate of 0.00%, protocol efficiency of 49.72 %, and quantum fidelity of 1.000 under certain conditions. During eavesdropping scenarios, the error rate increased to 16.90 %. The simplified AES achieved a 50.14 % avalanche effect and an encryption time of 0.3073 ms, reducing latency by 17 % compared to standard AES. These results suggest that combining QKD with lightweight AES can provide quantum resilience and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for secure communication in the post-quantum era."

The wider the slot, the lower the loss in simulation and measurement. At slot widths of 40 μm and 50 μm, the losses are reduced by 37% and 40% at 140 GHz as compared with the traditional GCPW. At 300 GHz, the losses are reduced by 27% and 34%."

Numerical results are provided that show superiority of our proposed approaches over the benchmark schemes in achieving higher sum-rates. In particular, it is demonstrated that one of our proposed approaches achieves up to 3.68 times higher sum-rate when compared to the benchmark schemes."
