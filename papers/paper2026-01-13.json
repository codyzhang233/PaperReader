    "abstract": "Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks. (The GS-Net toolbox will be released soon.)"

    "abstract": "The Contract Net Protocol (1980) introduced coordination through contracts in multi-agent systems. Modern agent protocols standardize connectivity and interoperability; yet, none provide formal, resource governance-normative mechanisms to bound how much agents may consume or how long they may operate. We introduce Agent Contracts, a formal framework that extends the contract metaphor from task allocation to resource-bounded execution. An Agent Contract unifies input/output specifications, multi-dimensional resource constraints, temporal boundaries, and success criteria into a coherent governance mechanism with explicit lifecycle semantics. For multi-agent coordination, we establish conservation laws ensuring delegated budgets respect parent constraints, enabling hierarchical coordination through contract delegation. Empirical validation across four experiments demonstrates 90% token reduction with 525x lower variance in iterative workflows, zero conservation violations in multi-agent delegation, and measurable quality-resource tradeoffs through contract modes. Agent Contracts provide formal foundations for predictable, auditable, and resource-bounded autonomous AI deployment."

In this paper, we show that Malcev theories and their models admit a well-behaved deformation theory, generalizing the classical deformation theory of rings and modules. As our main example, we prove that the Postnikov tower of a Malcev theory $\\mathcal{P}$ is a tower of square-zero extensions, and that all of this structure is preserved by passage to $\\infty$-categories of models. This allows us to control the difference between the $\\infty$-categories $\\mathrm{Model}_{h_{n+r}\\mathcal{P}}$ and $\\mathrm{Model}_{h_n\\mathcal{P}}$ for $r \\leq n$, and forms the basis of a ``cofibre of $τ$'' formalism in our approach to unstable synthetic homotopy theory. As an application, we derive from this a variety of new Blanc--Dwyer--Goerss style decompositions of moduli spaces of lifts along the tower $\\mathrm{Model}_{\\mathcal{P}}\\to\\cdots\\to\\mathrm{Model}_{h\\mathcal{P}}$."

Unlike existing evaluations that focus on narrow, well-defined tasks, APEX-SWE assesses two novel task types that reflect real-world software engineering work: (1) Integration tasks (n=100), which require constructing end-to-end systems across heterogeneous cloud primitives, business applications, and infrastructure-as-code services, and (2) Observability tasks (n=100), which require debugging production failures using telemetry signals such as logs and dashboards, as well as unstructured context. We evaluated eight frontier models on APEX-SWE. Gemini 3 Pro (Thinking = High) performs best, with a Pass@1 score of 25\\%. Our analysis shows that strong performance is primarily driven by epistemic reasoning, defined as the ability to distinguish between assumptions and verified facts, combined with agency to resolve uncertainty prior to acting. We open-source the APEX-SWE evaluation harness and a dev set (n=50)."

Using 50,390 decisions from 2,938 participants, we introduce two methodological advances to address this gap. First, we cluster behavioral trajectories by their temporal shape using Dynamic Time Warping, yielding distinct and theoretically interpretable behavioral types. Second, we apply a hierarchical inverse Q-learning framework that models decisions as discrete switches between latent cooperative and defective intentions. This approach reveals a large (21.4%) and previously unmodeled behavioral type -- Switchers -- who frequently reverse intentions rather than commit to stable strategies. At the same time, the framework recovers canonical strategic behaviors such as persistent cooperation and free-riding. Substantively, recognizing intentional volatility helps sustain cooperation: brief defections by Switchers often reverse, so strategic patience can prevent unnecessary breakdowns."

In the context of linear perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime the density of states is derived from the orthogonality of states in the solution space of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away. Unlike quasi-normal modes the modes are not directly observable outside of $\\sim 3 M$ but, being external to the horizon, they affect the propagation of null rays near the black hole. The characteristic frequencies, around 100 Hz for solar mass black holes, are discussed in relation to possible observations."

The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate."

    "abstract": "We consider semi-coherent binary systems that are subject to simultaneous failures of its components. These are systems whose components can be either working or failed; the system can also be working or failed depending on the state of the components; and repairing a component cannot cause the system to fail. We consider that one or more components can fail simultaneously, allowing us to model external shocks and disasters. For this, we use the Lévy-frailty Marshall-Olkin (LFMO) multivariate distribution to model the failure times of the components. We aim to answer in which states of the system we should repair the components. This is a challenging question, as the number of repair policies grows super-exponentially in the number of components. To tackle this, we propose a simple family of repair policies, which we call $r$-out-of-$n$:R repair policies, where one repairs all failed components when the system fails or when there are $r$ or more failed components. Our main contribution is that we derive exact and simple expressions for key performance-evaluation quantities of the system operating under our proposed repair policies. That is, we give explicit expressions for the mean time-to-failure of the system, mean time-to-repair, probability of system-failure before repair, and component- and system-repair rate. We also give expressions for the expected cost and long-term average cost, when there are components' and system repair cost. The only relevant parameters involved in the derived expressions are the structural signature of the system, and the Laplace exponent associated to the LFMO distribution."

In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases."

To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning."

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal. Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost."

Aïdékon (2013) obtained and described the convergence in law, as time $n$ goes to infinity, of $M_n-m_n$, where $m_n$ is an explicit function. Equivalently, he identified the limit of $\\mathbb{P}(M_n > m_n + x)$, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. More recently, Luo (2025) gave an asymptotic equivalent for the upper large deviation probability, that is $\\mathbb{P}(M_n > m_n + xn)$, for $x > 0$. In this work, we study an intermediate regime, called upper moderate deviation. We obtain, under close-to-optimal integrability conditions, an asymptotic equivalent for $\\mathbb{P}(M_n > m_n + x_n)$, where $x_n$ is such that $x_n \\to \\infty$ and $x_n = O(\\sqrt{n})$. Our proof is based on a strategy due to Bramson, Ding, and Zeitouni (2016). As a byproduct, we obtain information about the typical behavior of particles contributing to such deviations. Finally, we apply our main result to show the convergence in law of the centered maximum of a two-speed branching random walk in the mean regime and describe its limit."

While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models."

Evaluated on a multimodal next-song recommendation (i.e., playlist continuation) benchmark, FusID achieves zero ID conflicts, ensuring that each token sequence maps to exactly one song, mitigates codebook underutilization, and outperforms baselines in terms of MRR and Recall@k (k = 1, 5, 10, 20)."

    "abstract": "Recent developments in natural language processing highlight text as an emerging data source for ecology. Textual resources carry unique information that can be used in complementarity with geospatial data sources, thus providing insights at the local scale into environmental conditions and properties hidden from more traditional data sources. Leveraging textual information in a spatial context presents several challenges. First, the contribution of textual data remains poorly defined in an ecological context, and it is unclear for which tasks it should be incorporated. Unlike ubiquitous satellite imagery or environmental covariates, the availability of textual data is sparse and irregular; its integration with geospatial data is not straightforward. In response to these challenges, this work proposes an attention-based approach that combines aerial imagery and geolocated text within a spatial neighbourhood, i.e. integrating contributions from several nearby observations. Our approach combines vision and text representations with a geolocation encoding, with an attention-based module that dynamically selects spatial neighbours that are useful for predictive tasks.The proposed approach is applied to the EcoWikiRS dataset, which combines high-resolution aerial imagery with sentences extracted from Wikipedia describing local environmental conditions across Switzerland. Our model is evaluated on the task of predicting 103 environmental variables from the SWECO25 data cube. Our approach consistently outperforms single-location or unimodal, i.e. image-only or text-only, baselines. When analysing variables by thematic groups, results show a significant improvement in performance for climatic, edaphic, population and land use/land cover variables, underscoring the benefit of including the spatial context when combining text and image data."

    "abstract": "The deconfining transition in $SU(3)$ gauge theory, traditionally interpreted through the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model as a sharp third-order phase transition in the large-$N_c$ limit, appears as a smooth crossover in lattice QCD. This work demonstrates that the transition is topologically smoothed into a crossover by incorporating the fractal momentum space structure inherent to thermofractals. By matching the non-extensive $β$-function to one-loop QCD results, a fundamental scaling of the thermofractal index $q$ is derived as a function of the number of flavours $N_f$. It is proven that applying a $q$-deformed derivative operator $\\mathcal{D}_q$ to the $q$-logarithm of the eigenvalue distance results in a non-extensive measure that effectively smears the topological stiffness of the gauge vacuum. A unified master equation for the Polyakov loop $\\langle L \\rangle$ is presented, governed by the thermofractal index $q$ and a single variance parameter $σ^2(T)$ that scales as $T^{1/(q-1)}$. The observed phase dynamics are shown to be asymptotic limits of this unified density: a ``soft'' algebraic growth $\\langle L \\rangle \\propto T^{11}$ in the 1D string-like confined regime for $N_f=0$, and a rapid $1 - \\langle L \\rangle \\propto T^{-21}$ suppression in the 3D deconfined volume for $N_f=3$. This approach provides a microscopic foundation for partial deconfinement theory and reproduces lattice QCD data with a reduced $χ^2 \\approx 1.12$, offering a rigorous reconciliation between matrix model topology and the continuous QCD crossover."

    "abstract": "Political corruption is inherently an affiliation process linking agents to corruption cases; yet it is often studied via one-mode projections that connect co-offenders within the same scandal, implying a loss of information that potentially confounds properties of agents and cases. Here, we adopt a bipartite representation to analyze datasets of corruption scandals in Brazil and Spain spanning nearly three decades. By tracking the temporal growth of these networks, we quantify density and redundancy measures to capture partner reuse and co-occurrence across cases. Networks in both countries become progressively sparser over time, and agent redundancy is systematically higher than case redundancy, indicating a small cadre of recidivists who recombine largely with novice partners rather than forming durable co-offending ties. These networks exhibit near-exponential degree distributions, reflecting low recidivism and likely high coordination costs and secrecy constraints of large-scale scandals. Our bipartite view further reveals a moderate cross-mode disassortative degree mixing between agents and cases, with high-degree agents distributing their activity across small cases and large scandals mainly comprising low-degree participants. Finally, identifying atypical individuals within the bipartite structure reveals criminal trajectories marked by a gradual rise in network embeddedness that can appear ordinary in agent-projected networks."

    "abstract": "Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817."

    "abstract": "For a given quantum state used in sensing, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable by an unbiased estimator of an unknown parameter, determined by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown parameter from measurements on a physical system. Thus, a central goal in quantum parameter estimation is to find a measurement, described by a POVM, that saturates the QFI (achieves maximum CFI), and thereby achieves the QCRB. In the idealization that one uses pure states and unitary encodings for sensing, discontinuities can appear in the CFI but not the QFI. In this article, we demonstrate that these discontinuities are important features, quantifying how much Fisher information is lost in the presence of noise. We refer to this as the Fisher information \"fragility\". We present a simple framework for understanding how discontinuities increase fragility through Jensen's inequality, and demonstrate how one can use this framework to design more robust POVMs for quantum advantage in metrology."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "The unification type of an equational theory is defined using a preorder on substitutions, called the instantiation preorder, whose scope is either restricted to the variables occurring in the unification problem, or unrestricted such that all variables are considered. It has been known for more than three decades that the unification type of an equational theory may vary, depending on which instantiation preorder is used. More precisely, it was shown in 1991 that the theory ACUI of an associative, commutative, and idempotent binary function symbol with a unit is unitary w.r.t. the restricted instantiation preorder, but not unitary w.r.t. the unrestricted one. In 2016 this result was strengthened by showing that the unrestricted type of this theory also cannot be finitary. In the conference version of this article, we considerably improved on this result by proving that ACUI is infinitary w.r.t. the unrestricted instantiation preorder, thus precluding type zero. We also showed that, w.r.t. this preorder, the unification type of ACU (where idempotency is removed from the axioms) and of AC (where additionally the unit is removed) is infinitary, though it is respectively unitary and finitary in the restricted case. In the other direction, we proved (using the example of unification in the description logic EL) that the unification type may actually improve from type zero to infinitary when switching from the restricted instantiation preorder to the unrestricted one. In the present article, we not only determine the unrestricted unification type of considerably more equational theories, but we also prove general results for whole classes of theories. In particular, we show that theories that are regular and finite, regular and locally finite, or regular, monoidal, and satisfy an additional condition are Noetherian, and thus cannot have unrestricted unification type zero."

The algorithm is motivated by the nonlinear additive Schwarz method and exploits the domain-decomposition-inspired additive architecture of FBPINNs, in which local neural networks are defined on subdomains, thereby localizing the network representation. Parallel, subdomain-local quasi-Newton corrections are then constructed on the corresponding local parts of the architecture. A key feature is a novel nonlinear multi-preconditioning mechanism, in which subdomain corrections are optimally combined through the solution of a low-dimensional subspace minimization problem. Numerical experiments indicate that MP-LBFGS can improve convergence speed, as well as model accuracy over standard LBFGS while incurring lower communication overhead."

These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them."

    "abstract": "Accurate and generalisable segmentation of stroke lesions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for advancing clinical research, prognostic modelling, and personalised interventions. Although deep learning has improved automated lesion delineation, many existing models are optimised for narrow imaging contexts and generalise poorly to independent datasets, modalities, and stroke stages. Here, we systematically evaluated stroke lesion segmentation using the nnU-Net framework across multiple heterogeneous, publicly available MRI datasets spanning acute and chronic stroke. Models were trained and tested on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T1-weighted MRI, and evaluated on independent datasets. Across stroke stages, models showed robust generalisation, with segmentation accuracy approaching reported inter-rater reliability. Performance varied with imaging modality and training data characteristics. In acute stroke, DWI-trained models consistently outperformed FLAIR-based models, with only modest gains from multimodal combinations. In chronic stroke, increasing training set size improved performance, with diminishing returns beyond several hundred cases. Lesion volume was a key determinant of accuracy: smaller lesions were harder to segment, and models trained on restricted volume ranges generalised poorly. MRI image quality further constrained generalisability: models trained on lower-quality scans transferred poorly, whereas those trained on higher-quality data generalised well to noisier images. Discrepancies between predictions and reference masks were often attributable to limitations in manual annotations. Together, these findings show that automated lesion segmentation can approach human-level performance while identifying key factors governing generalisability and informing the development of lesion segmentation tools."

We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \\texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies."

This makes complex rules practical and auditable, helping close the gap between technical progress and what healthcare actually needs. We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps.

Unlike prior financial benchmarks, QuantEval integrates a CTA-style backtesting framework that executes model-generated strategies and evaluates them using financial performance metrics, enabling a more realistic assessment of quantitative coding ability. We evaluate some state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe substantial gaps to human experts, particularly in reasoning and strategy coding. Finally, we conduct large-scale supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning experiments on domain-aligned data, demonstrating consistent improvements. We hope QuantEval will facilitate research on LLMs' quantitative finance capabilities and accelerate their practical adoption in real-world trading workflows.

    "abstract": "We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fréchet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions. Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods. At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone."

Although the reliability of SAPF in space environments has been thoroughly studied, its reliability in ground environments during storage is always ignored, potentially leading to system failure. This paper aims to investigate the reliability of SAPF in storage environments, focusing on the effects of temperature and relative humidity. Firstly, the relationship between the performance degradation of SAPF and aluminum corrosion is identified. Next, considering the presence of two distinct stages in the influence of temperature on aluminum corrosion, a novel degradation model accounting for the degradation mechanism transition is developed. Additionally, a parameter analysis method is proposed for determining SAPF degradation mechanism based on experimental data. Then, a statistical analysis method incorporating an improved rime optimization algorithm is employed for parameter estimation, and the reliability model is established. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identifies two distinct stages in the impact of temperature on SAPF performance degradation. Furthermore, the proposed degradation model outperforms traditional degradation models with unchanged degradation mechanism in terms of degradation prediction accuracy, extrapolation capability and robustness, indicating its suitability for describing the degradation pattern of SAPFs."

    "abstract": "While recent research has systematically documented political orientation in large language models (LLMs), existing evaluations rely primarily on direct probing or demographic persona engineering to surface ideological biases. In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques."

Let $G$ be one of the Lie groups $\\mathrm{PSL}(n)$, $\\mathrm{PSp}(n)$ (for even $n$), or $\\mathrm{PSO}(n)$ (for odd $n$). In this paper, we construct the symplectic groupoid integrating the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii Poisson structure associated to $G$ and prove that it is Morita equivalent to the quasi-symplectic groupoid integrating the Dirac structure on $Y_n(\\mathbf{C})$, where $Y_n(\\mathbf{C})$ denotes the quotient of the space of quasi-periodic non-degenerate curves by homotopies preserving the monodromy."

    "abstract": "Data curation is a critical yet under-researched step in the machine translation training paradigm. To train translation systems, data acquisition relies primarily on human translations and digital parallel sources or, to a limited degree, synthetic generation. But, for low-resource languages, human translation to generate sufficient data is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a framework that screens source sentences to form efficient parallel text, ensuring optimal MT system performance in low-resource environments. We approach this by evaluating English-Hindi bi-text to determine effective sentence selection strategies for optimal MT system training. Our extensively tested framework, (Lexical And Linguistically Informed Text Analysis) LALITA, targets source sentence selection using lexical and linguistic features to curate parallel corpora. We find that by training mostly on complex sentences from both existing and synthetic datasets, our method significantly improves translation quality. We test this by simulating low-resource data availabilty with curated datasets of 50K to 800K English sentences and report improved performances on all data sizes. LALITA demonstrates remarkable efficiency, reducing data needs by more than half across multiple languages (Hindi, Odia, Nepali, Norwegian Nynorsk, and German). This approach not only reduces MT systems training cost by reducing training data requirement, but also showcases LALITA's utility in data augmentation."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in search-augmented large reasoning models (LRMs) enable the retrieval of external knowledge to reduce hallucinations in multistep reasoning. However, their ability to operate on graph-structured data, prevalent in domains such as e-commerce, social networks, and scientific citations, remains underexplored. Unlike plain text corpora, graphs encode rich topological signals that connect related entities and can serve as valuable priors for retrieval, enabling more targeted search and improved reasoning efficiency. Yet, effectively leveraging such structure poses unique challenges, including the difficulty of generating graph-expressive queries and ensuring reliable retrieval that balances structural and semantic relevance. To address this gap, we introduce GraphSearch, the first framework that extends search-augmented reasoning to graph learning, enabling zero-shot graph learning without task-specific fine-tuning. GraphSearch combines a Graph-aware Query Planner, which disentangles search space (e.g., 1-hop, multi-hop, or global neighbors) from semantic queries, with a Graph-aware Retriever, which constructs candidate sets based on topology and ranks them using a hybrid scoring function. We further instantiate two traversal modes: GraphSearch-R, which recursively expands neighborhoods hop by hop, and GraphSearch-F, which flexibly retrieves across local and global neighborhoods without hop constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GraphSearch achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to supervised graph learning methods, setting state-of-the-art results in zero-shot node classification and link prediction. These findings position GraphSearch as a flexible and generalizable paradigm for agentic reasoning over graphs."

We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding.

Existing benchmarks for evaluating AFC systems, however, are largely limited in terms of task scope, modalities, domain, language diversity, realism, or coverage of misinformation types. Critically, they are static, thus subject to data leakage as their claims enter the pretraining corpora of LLMs. As a result, benchmark performance no longer reliably reflects the actual ability to verify claims. We introduce Verified Theses and Statements (VeriTaS), the first dynamic benchmark for multimodal AFC, designed to remain robust under ongoing large-scale pretraining of foundation models. VeriTaS currently comprises 24,000 real-world claims from 108 professional fact-checking organizations across 54 languages, covering textual and audiovisual content. Claims are added quarterly via a fully automated seven-stage pipeline that normalizes claim formulation, retrieves original media, and maps heterogeneous expert verdicts to a novel, standardized, and disentangled scoring scheme with textual justifications. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that the automated annotations closely match human judgments. We commit to update VeriTaS in the future, establishing a leakage-resistant benchmark, supporting meaningful AFC evaluation in the era of rapidly evolving foundation models. We will make the code and data publicly available."

In this spirit, enhancing energy transport has recently been of special interest. Exciton--exciton annihilation is commonly used to quantify energy transfer in excitonic systems, and has been recently applied to investigate transport dynamics in polaritonic systems. However, the interpretation of experimental findings is challenging without a microscopic theory that accounts for the various nonradiative relaxation channels determining the quasiparticle diffusion length. In this work, we develop a microscopic model for polariton annihilation based on exciton--exciton annihilation and propose an exciton--photon annihilation as the decisive process that competes with exciton--exciton annihilation. The interplay between exciton--exciton and exciton--photon annihilation ultimately governs the annihilation dynamics and sets the fundamental limit to the transport efficiency. Our model explains recent experimental results and demonstrates that increased annihilation rates might serve as an explicit fingerprint to differentiate between the response of polaritons and other untargeted effects."

Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Our experiments validate the feasibility and advantages of entropy as a self-triggering signal, reveal that even a 4B small-scale experience model can significantly boost the performance of larger agent models."

Therefore, we propose surveillance schemes for systemic risk, which allow to detect misspecified systemic risk forecasts in an \"online\" fashion. This enables daily monitoring of the forecasts while controlling for the accumulation of false test rejections. Such online schemes are vital in taking timely countermeasures to avoid financial distress. Our monitoring procedures allow multiple series at once to be monitored, thus increasing the likelihood and the speed at which early signs of trouble may be picked up. The tests hold size by construction, such that the null of correct systemic risk assessments is only rejected during the monitoring period with (at most) a pre-specified probability. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the good finite-sample properties of our procedures. An empirical application to US banks during multiple crises demonstrates the usefulness of our surveillance schemes for both regulators and financial institutions."

As an application, we determine the image of the Hitchin morphism restricted to the smallest closed stratum of the Dolbeault moduli space when $X$ is smooth. This allows us to determine the image of the Hitchin morphism from the Dolbeault moduli space when $X$ is a hyperelliptic or abelian variety in characteristic $p\\ge0$.

Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT."

Instead, superconductivity emerges as robust filaments at geometric nodes, forming a pair density wave. This state features a sign-reversing order parameter, detectable via impurity-induced zero-energy modes. Our findings reveal a unique geometric origin for filamentary superconductivity, offering new perspectives on strain-tuned quantum phases in Dirac materials."

This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings. In doing so, we clarify the sources of discrepancies in the literature and offer a unified perspective on excited-state engineering strategies in two-dimensional TMDs."

Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task."

The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment."

Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes."

Beginning with a baseline model that has deficiencies, including inadequate demographic representation and prediction uncertainty, we document an enhancement process guided by AI certification requirements. The enhanced system achieves higher accuracy with improved reliability metrics and comprehensive fairness across demographic groups. We focused our assessment on two of the six Fraunhofer catalogue dimensions, reliability and fairness, the enhanced system successfully satisfies the certification criteria for these examined dimensions. We find that the certification framework provides value as a proactive development tool, driving concrete technical improvements and generating documentation naturally through integration into the development process. However, fundamental gaps separate structured self-certification from legal compliance: harmonized European standards are not fully available, and AI assessment frameworks and catalogues cannot substitute for them on their own.

This paper introduces a more flexible framework that allows for multidimensional unobservables and non-additive separability, and provides sufficient conditions for identifying the average treatment effect on the treated. An empirical application to job displacement reveals substantially smaller long-run earnings losses compared to the standard DID approach, demonstrating the framework's ability to account for unobserved heterogeneity that manifests as differential outcome trajectories between treated and control groups."

Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states. We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states. Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems."

Evaluated on a next-generation HPC platform, MatrixPIC achieves significant performance gains. In Laser-Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) simulations, it delivers up to $2.63\\times$ speedup in total runtime. For third-order deposition, the core kernel is accelerated by $8.7\\times$ over the baseline and $2.0\\times$ over the best hand-optimized VPU implementation. Moreover, MatrixPIC reaches $83.08\\%$ of theoretical CPU peak performance, nearly $2.8\\times$ higher than a highly optimized CUDA kernel on a data center GPU. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of matrix-oriented co-design for accelerating PIC simulations on emerging CPU architectures."

    "abstract": "Tool-Integrated Reasoning has emerged as a key paradigm to augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with computational capabilities, yet integrating tool-use into long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of training data and the challenge of integrating tool-use without compromising the model's intrinsic long-chain reasoning. In this paper, we introduce DART (Discovery And Reinforcement of Tool-Integrated Reasoning Chains via Rollout Trees), a reinforcement learning framework that enables spontaneous tool-use during long CoT reasoning without human annotation. DART operates by constructing dynamic rollout trees during training to discover valid tool-use opportunities, branching out at promising positions to explore diverse tool-integrated trajectories. Subsequently, a tree-based process advantage estimation identifies and credits specific sub-trajectories where tool invocation positively contributes to the solution, effectively reinforcing these beneficial behaviors. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like AIME and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that DART significantly outperforms existing methods, successfully harmonizing tool execution with long CoT reasoning."

    "abstract": "We present a compact slit-based interface that enables reflection mode conversion in an elastic plate by transforming an incident lowest-order antisymmetric Lamb mode into a reflected lowest-order symmetric Lamb mode. The interface is realized by introducing inclined vacuum slits along the lateral sides of the plate. This geometry intentionally breaks symmetry and produces a strongly localized, vortex-like deformation near the slit tips, which provides an efficient coupling pathway from the antisymmetric incident response to a symmetric reflected component. The conversion is quantified in a consistent, field-based manner by extracting the reflected antisymmetric level from the standing-wave envelope on a probe line placed sufficiently far from the slits, and then inferring the converted symmetric energy under a lossless assumption with only two reflected propagating channels. The proposed design delivers strong low-frequency conversion and sustains broadband half-power operation, while parametric studies confirm that the performance is tunable and robust over a wide range of slit angles and widths."

By engineering slot couplers with an effectivemedium channel for impedance and modal matching, the waveguide achieves a fractional 3-dB bandwidth of 40% with a maximum coupling efficiency of 90% in the WR-2.2 band (330-500 GHz). By employing a broadband uni-traveling-carrier photodiode transmitter and sub-harmonic mixer receivers, we achieve an aggregated data rate of 0.8 Tbit/s with quadrature amplitude modulation schemes across 14 channels from 330-600 GHz. The effective-medium-slot waveguide platform yields robust broadband coupling with enhanced mechanical protection, offering reliable interconnects for ultra-high-speed terahertz integrated systems."

However, unleashing this potential requires bridging the critical gap between abstract reasoning and physical actuation, a capability we term tool intelligence. In this article, we explore the landscape of tool engineering to empower agentic AI in communications. We first analyze the functionalities of tool intelligence and its effects on communications. We then propose a systematic review for tool engineering, covering the entire lifecycle from tool creation and discovery to selection, learning, and benchmarking. Furthermore, we present a case study on tool-assisted uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectory planning to demonstrate the realization of tool intelligence in communications. By introducing a teacher-guided reinforcement learning approach with a feasibility shield, we enable agents to intelligently operate tools. They utilize external tools to eliminate navigational uncertainty while mastering cost-aware scheduling under strict energy constraints.

By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a \"Skepticism Trap\" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination.

The Wishart distribution, $S=W_0W_0^\\top\\sim\\mathcal{W}_m(n,σ^2 \\boldsymbol{I}_m)$, used for computing the output marginal variance is derived in closed form using expectations of zonal polynomials via James' theorem and a Laplace-integral expansion of $(α\\boldsymbol{I}_m+S)^{-1}$.

Monte Carlo experiments confirm the theoretical estimates. Furthermore, empirical analysis was performed to quantify that, using current He or Kaiming initialization with scaling $1/\\sqrt{n}$, the output variance is $0.41$, whereas the new parameterization with $10/ \\sqrt{n}$ for $α=1$ results in an output variance of $0.9$. The findings clarify why deep $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz networks suffer rapid information loss at initialization and offer practical prescriptions for choosing initialization hyperparameters to mitigate this effect. However, using the Higgs boson classification dataset, a hyperparameter sweep over optimizers, initialization scale, and depth was conducted to validate the results on real-world data, showing that although the derivation ensures variance preservation, empirical results indicate He initialization still performs better."

To address this challenge and improve positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GPS/INS fusion network (BGFN) based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). The BGFN architecture integrates a spiking Transformer with a spiking encoder to simultaneously extract spatial features from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and capture their temporal dynamics. By modeling the relationship between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments, the network leverages both current and historical IMU data to estimate vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through real-world field tests and experiments on public datasets. Compared to conventional deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate that BGFN achieves higher accuracy and enhanced reliability in navigation performance, particularly under prolonged GPS outages."

Recent advances in the study of magnetic topological materials have highlighted their intriguing anomalous Hall and thermoelectric effects, arising primarily from large intrinsic Berry curvature. Here, we report observation of a large room-temperature (RT) anomalous Nernst effects (ANE) of S_xy^A ~ 1.3 μV K^(-1) in the kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) ErMn6Sn6, which is comparable to the largest signals observed in known magnetic materials. Surprisingly, we further found that a significant topological Nernst signal at RT and peaking a maximum of approximately 0.2 μV K^(-1) at 180 K, exactly coupling with ANE in the spiral AFM state, originates from the real-space nonzero spin chirality caused by incommensurate spin structure. This study demonstrates a potential room-temperature thermoelectric application platform based on Nernst effect, and provides insights for discovering significant anomalous and topological transverse transport effects in the incommensurate AFM system."

    "abstract": "Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has attracted considerable attention due to its potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure."

    "abstract": "In domains such as biomedicine, materials, and finance, high-stakes deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires injecting private, domain-specific knowledge that is proprietary, fast-evolving, and under-represented in public pretraining. However, the two dominant paradigms for private knowledge injection each have pronounced drawbacks: fine-tuning is expensive to iterate, and continual updates risk catastrophic forgetting and general-capability regression; retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) keeps the base model intact but is brittle in specialized private corpora due to chunk-induced evidence fragmentation, retrieval drift, and long-context pressure that yields query-dependent prompt inflation. Inspired by how multimodal LLMs align heterogeneous modalities into a shared semantic space, we propose Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which treats private expertise as an additional expert modality and injects it via a compact, representation-level interface aligned to the frozen base model, avoiding prompt-time evidence serialization while enabling plug-and-play specialization and scalable multi-domain composition with reliable selective activation. Across two private scientific QA benchmarks (immunology adjuvant and catalytic materials) and mixed-domain evaluations, GAG improves specialist performance over strong RAG baselines by 15.34% and 14.86% on the two benchmarks, respectively, while maintaining performance on six open general benchmarks and enabling near-oracle selective activation for scalable multi-domain deployment."

    "abstract": "Non-Newtonian fluids encompass a large family of fluids with additional nonlinear material properties, contributing to non-trivial flow behaviour that cannot be captured through a single constant viscosity term. Common non-Newtonian characteristics include shear-thinning, shear-thickening, viscoplasticity, and viscoelasticity, commonly encountered in everyday fluids, such as ketchup, blood, toothpaste, mud, etc., as well as practical applications involving porous media, cosmetics, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. Due to the complex nature of these fluids, accurate computational fluid dynamics simulations are essential for predicting their behaviour under various flow conditions. Recent advancements have highlighted the growing trend of using the lattice Boltzmann method to solve such complex flows, owing to its ability to handle intricate boundary conditions, ease of including additional multiphysics, and providing computationally efficient parallel simulations. Since the initial review over a decade ago [Phillips & Roberts, IMA J. Appl. Math. 76, 790-816 (2011)], significant advancements have been made to the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate non-Newtonian fluids. Here, we present a comprehensive review of different lattice Boltzmann techniques used to solve non-Newtonian fluid systems, specifically dealing with shear-dependent viscosity, viscoplasticity, and viscoelasticity. In addition, we discuss various benchmark cases that validate these approaches and highlight their growing application to realistic and challenging complex flow problems. We further address outstanding issues in current lattice Boltzmann models, as well as future directions for numerical advancement and application."

At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme.

Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter."

Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available."

    "abstract": "This study investigates how the deposit body influences friction characteristics by altering local flow fields, which is closely related to bed shear stress. Using generalized flume experiments, the study assesses the applicability of classical uniform flow friction models in deposit body river sections, revealing frictional changes induced by flow field non-uniformity. Initially, based on \\( \\frac{u_*}{\\sqrt{\\overline{w'^2}}} = 0.85 \\sim 1.15 \\) under uniform flow conditions as the judgment basis, the reliability of the classical model is verified. Four models are then applied to estimate near-bed friction velocity in deposit body sections. Results show a significant alignment between the longitudinal velocity gradient and the peak friction velocity derived from the turbulent kinetic energy method (TKE). Dimensional analysis of friction indicators reveals that: (a) friction velocity is primarily influenced by turbulence intensity, with constricted and narrowed sections resembling uniform flow, while the expansion section forms a peak; (b) models incorporating flow field fluctuations (TKE, Vertical Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE w'), Reynolds shear stress method (RSS)) effectively capture the impact of non-uniform flow fields on friction characteristics; (c) when energy states are low or when deposit body proportions are large, the deposit body's resistance ratio increases, and peak friction velocity rises. This study provides theoretical insights into friction estimation and sediment transport in non-uniform flow fields of deposit bodies."

    "abstract": "Agentic memory systems have become critical for enabling LLM agents to maintain long-term context and retrieve relevant information efficiently. However, existing memory frameworks suffer from a fundamental limitation: they perform exhaustive retrieval across the entire storage layer regardless of query characteristics. This brute-force approach creates severe latency bottlenecks as memory grows, hindering real-time agent interactions. We propose SwiftMem, a query-aware agentic memory system that achieves sub-linear retrieval through specialized indexing over temporal and semantic dimensions. Our temporal index enables logarithmic-time range queries for time-sensitive retrieval, while the semantic DAG-Tag index maps queries to relevant topics through hierarchical tag structures. To address memory fragmentation during growth, we introduce an embedding-tag co-consolidation mechanism that reorganizes storage based on semantic clusters to improve cache locality. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftMem achieves 47$\\times$ faster search compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment of memory-augmented LLM agents."

To enable self-evolving agents in user-facing service environments, we propose WISE-Flow, a workflow-centric framework that converts historical service interactions into reusable procedural experience by inducing workflows with prerequisite-augmented action blocks.

This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a downlink Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) system within a physically-consistent setting, accounting for the effect of mutual coupling between RIS elements arising due to sub-element spacing. The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems."

    "abstract": "Diffusion and flow policies are gaining prominence in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressive power, yet training them efficiently remains a critical challenge. A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines."

To address this gap, we introduce the Reasoning Model Confidence estimation Benchmark (RMCB), a public resource of 347,496 reasoning traces from six popular LRMs across different architectural families. The benchmark is constructed from a diverse suite of datasets spanning high-stakes domains, including clinical, financial, legal, and mathematical reasoning, alongside complex general reasoning benchmarks, with correctness annotations provided for all samples. Using RMCB, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of over ten distinct representation-based methods, spanning sequential, graph-based, and text-based architectures. Our central finding is a persistent trade-off between discrimination (AUROC) and calibration (ECE): text-based encoders achieve the best AUROC (0.672), while structurally-aware models yield the best ECE (0.148), with no single method dominating both. Furthermore, we find that increased architectural complexity does not reliably outperform simpler sequential baselines, suggesting a performance ceiling for methods relying solely on chunk-level hidden states. This work provides the most comprehensive benchmark for this task to date, establishing rigorous baselines and demonstrating the limitations of current representation-based paradigms."

    "abstract": "Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \\textit{S}tepping \\textit{S}tone \\textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results."

In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems."

    "abstract": "Many applied problems contain signal that becomes clear only after combining multiple raw measurements. Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features."

Conditional generation--particularly the generation of crystal structures with specified stability or other physical properties has been actively researched for material discovery purposes. Meanwhile, the generative models capable of symmetry-aware generation are also under active development, because space group symmetry has a strong relationship with the physical properties of materials. In this study, we demonstrate that the symmetry control in the previous conditional crystal generation model may not be sufficiently effective when space group constraints are applied as a condition. To address this problem, we propose the WyckoffDiff-Adaptor, which embeds conditional generation within a WyckoffDiff architecture that effectively diffuses Wyckoff positions to achieve precise symmetry control. We successfully generated formation energy phase diagrams while specifying stable structures of particular combination of elements, such as Li--O and Ti--O systems, while simultaneously preserving the symmetry of the input conditions. The proposed method with symmetry-aware conditional generation demonstrates promising results as an effective approach to achieving the discovery of novel materials with targeted physical properties."

On the theoretical side, ab initio lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations of hadronic vacuum polarization have made remarkable progress. They are now the new standard for studying the leading non-perturbative contributions, which have previously hindered matching with the precision required for full exploitation of the experimental results. The lattice results affected both leading hadronic contributions the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contributions by increasing the previously generally accepted $e^+e^-$ to hadrons based dispersion relation results. The shifts reduced the discrepancy between theory and experiment, leaving nothing missing. One of the most prominent signs of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has disappeared: the SM appears validated more than ever, in agreement with what other searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN tell us! A triumph of the SM, even though the SM cannot explain known cosmological puzzles like dark matter or baryogenesis, and why neutrino masses are so tiny, the absence of strong CP violation, for example. I also argue that the discrepancy between the data-driven dispersive result and the lattice QCD results for the hadronic vacuum polarization can be largely explained by correcting the $e^+e^-$ data for 'rho-gamma' mixing effects."

To address this, we propose AdaJudge, a unified framework that jointly adapts representation and aggregation. AdaJudge first refines backbone representations into a discrimination-oriented space via gated refinement blocks. It then replaces the static readout with an adaptive multi-view pooling module that dynamically routes and combines evidence. Extensive experiments on RM-Bench and JudgeBench show that AdaJudge outperforms strong off-the-shelf reward models and traditional pooling baselines."

Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 μ$eV/mV up to $4 μ$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes. We expect that these characterization results may aid in subsequent spatial triangulation of the charge fluctuators."

Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm.

MASH sequentially employs style-injection supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and inference-time refinement to shape the distributions of AI-generated texts to resemble those of human-written texts. Experiments across 6 datasets and 5 detectors demonstrate the superior performance of MASH over 11 baseline evaders. Specifically, MASH achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 92%, surpassing the strongest baselines by an average of 24%, while maintaining superior linguistic quality."

    "abstract": "Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE#videohedge ."

We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \\textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\\pm40\\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\\sim0.03\\,M_{\\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\\propto M^{-α}$) with $α=1.62\\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\\,M_{\\odot}$ and $α=0.46\\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\\,M_{\\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties."

In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of AI has fueled the expansion of accelerator- or GPU-based data centers. However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown). We further investigate the effect of data and tensor parallelism, and show our discovered clock frequencies translate well for both. We conclude that kernel-level DVFS is a suitable technique to reduce waste in LLM operations, providing significant energy savings with negligible slow-down."

    "abstract": "We present systematic and resource-efficient constructions of continuous symmetry projectors, particularly $U(1)$ particle number and $SU(2)$ total spin, tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computations. Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates. These results establish continuous-symmetry projectors as practical and scalable tools for state preparation in quantum chemistry and provide a pathway toward realizing more efficient fault-tolerant quantum simulations."

    "abstract": "In knockout tournaments, players compete in successive rounds, with losers eliminated and winners advancing until a single champion remains. Given a tournament digraph $D$, which encodes the outcomes of all possible matches, and a designated player $v^* \\in V(D)$, the \\textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem (TFP) asks whether the tournament can be scheduled in a way that guarantees $v^*$ emerges as the winner. TFP is known to be NP-hard, but is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by structural measures such as the feedback arc set (fas) or feedback vertex set (fvs) number of the tournament digraph. In this paper, we introduce and study two new structural parameters: the number of players who can defeat $v^*$ (i.e., the in-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $k$) and the number of players that $v^*$ can defeat (i.e., the out-degree of $v^*$, denoted by $\\ell$). A natural question is that: can TFP be efficiently solved when $k$ or $\\ell$ is small? We answer this question affirmatively by showing that TFP is FPT when parameterized by either the in-degree or out-degree of $v^*$. Our algorithm for the in-degree parameterization is particularly involved and technically intricate. Notably, the in-degree $k$ can remain small even when other structural parameters, such as fas or fvs, are large. Hence, our results offer a new perspective and significantly broaden the parameterized algorithmic understanding of the \\textsc{Tournament Fixing} problem."

    "abstract": "Recent LLMs increasingly integrate reasoning mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, this explicit reasoning exposes a new attack surface for inference-time backdoors, which inject malicious reasoning paths without altering model parameters. Because these attacks generate linguistically coherent paths, they effectively evade conventional detection. To address this, we propose STAR (State-Transition Amplification Ratio), a framework that detects backdoors by analyzing output probability shifts. STAR exploits the statistical discrepancy where a malicious input-induced path exhibits high posterior probability despite a low prior probability in the model's general knowledge. We quantify this state-transition amplification and employ the CUSUM algorithm to detect persistent anomalies. Experiments across diverse models (8B-70B) and five benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAR exhibits robust generalization capabilities, consistently achieving near-perfect performance (AUROC $\\approx$ 1.0) with approximately $42\\times$ greater efficiency than existing baselines. Furthermore, the framework proves robust against adaptive attacks attempting to bypass detection."

This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d_L(z)=c\\,H_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\\simeq1.1$. It outperforms the $Λ$CDM and flat $w$CDM models and the (2,1) Padé approximant for $d_L(z)$, and performs comparably to the flat $Λ$CDM model and the (2,1) Padé($j_0=1$) model of Hu et al. Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\\propto q_0+1$. We fit the empirical relation to SN data in eight deep-field regions and find that their fitted $\\mathcal{M}$ and $b$ parameters are consistent within $1.6\\,σ$, in agreement with isotropy. The inferred $q_0$ values, ranging from $-0.6$ to $-0.4$, are consistent within $1.5\\,σ$ and significantly lower than zero, indicating statistically consistent cosmic acceleration across all eight regions. We apply the empirical relation to the DES-Dovekie and Amalgame SN samples, finding $b$ values consistent with those from DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+.

To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies."

Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility. This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice."

To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication."

    "abstract": "Objectives: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with extensive peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings."

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work."

To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands. We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles. Our experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total."

MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation. Notably, MMLGNet achieves strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, outperforming several established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant benefit of language supervision.

However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs"

Building on recent work showing that the resulting Kantorovich distance can be expressed as a minimization problem over the set of spanning trees of this underlying graph, we investigate the implications of this reformulation on the construction of an optimal transport plan and a dual potential based on the solution of such an optimization problem. In this setting, we derive an explicit formula for the Kantorovich potential in terms of the imbalanced cumulative mass (a generalization of the cumulative distribution in R) along an optimal spanning tree solving such a minimization problem, under a weak non-degeneracy condition on the pair of measures that guarantees the uniqueness of a dual potential. Our second contribution establishes the existence of an optimal transport plan that can be computed efficiently by a dynamic programming procedure once an optimal spanning tree is known. Finally, we propose a stochastic algorithm based on simulated annealing on the space of spanning trees to compute such an optimal spanning tree. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach for optimal transport on finite metric spaces."

Langevin dynamics simulations are used to study the evolution of perturbations at the interface between these two distinct species of charged dust particles, subject to an externally applied electric field and an equilibrium charge density gradient. We have performed analytical calculations to determine the growth rate of instability under both strongly coupled and weakly coupled dusty plasma regimes. These theoretical predictions are subsequently validated through molecular dynamics simulations, enabling the reproduction of the instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma. The instability in these cases ultimately causes mixing among the charged species. The study comprehensively analyzes the growth rate as a function of various system parameters, and it offers deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms."

Based on retrospective smoking histories from the Swiss Health Survey, a panel of individuals' annual smoking status is reconstructed, containing more than one million observations from 1993 to 2017. Estimation relies on staggered difference-in-differences as well as a complementary latent factor model, which relaxes the common trends assumption. The findings indicate that tobacco billboard bans lead to a reduction in smoking rates. Reductions of up to 0.9 percentage points correspond to an approximate 3% decline in the smoking rate. The effect is driven by women and individuals aged 25-44 and 65+. Overall, this evidence suggests that even partial tobacco advertising bans, such as billboard bans, can effectively reduce smoking rates and serve as a valuable policy tool within comprehensive tobacco prevention strategies."

A unitless quantity has been defined, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369 at this limit. The ratio between the magnitudes of the electric fields of the generated photons and of vacuum has been also calculated, equal to 1.718, and the pump intensity has been plotted as a function of the interaction length for different values of the second-order electric susceptibility in the case of SPDC and of the third-order electric susceptibility for FWM. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the nonlinear process can be truly considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while the generated photons mainly govern the pump photon splitting above the limit, which corresponds more to an optical parametric amplification / difference frequency generation regime. Knowing quantitatively the limit between the two regimes thanks to the present calculations will be a useful guide for further quantum calculations and measurements from either side of the limit in order to catch the full quantum picture of SPDC and FWM from low to high pump intensities."

Molecular dynamics simulations using the AIREBO potential under the same geometry and loading protocol previously studied with ReaxFF, are employed, so enabling a direct comparison. Stress-strain responses, Young's modulus, an effective mode-I stress intensity factor, and energy absorption are evaluated as functions of $W_{\\text{gap}}$. Compared with ReaxFF, AIREBO predicts lower peak stresses and earlier catastrophic softening, leading to reduced post-peak deformation capacity and energy absorption. Ductility and energy absorption are shown to be highly potential-dependent, underscoring the need for careful potential selection in defect-engineered graphene fracture simulations."

Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments."

This yields a dramatic speedup in dilute regimes ($N_e \\ll N$), opening unbiased access to large-scale simulations of strongly correlated low-density phases. We validate the method on the dilute electron gas with onsite Hubbard interactions, observing the suppression of the fermion sign problem in the dilute limit. Furthermore, we apply this approach to an one-dimensional flat-band system, where the canonical ensemble allows for precise control over filling. We reveal a ferromagnetic instability at low temperatures in the half-filling regime. Our linear-scaling approach provides a powerful tool for investigating emergent phenomena in dilute quantum matter."

The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol.

Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques."

    "abstract": "The evolution of recommender systems has shifted preference storage from rating matrices and dense embeddings to semantic memory in the agentic era. Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

    "abstract": "In quantum software engineering (QSE), quantum software testing (QST) has attracted increasing attention as quantum software systems grow in scale and complexity. Since QST evaluates quantum programs through execution under designed test inputs, empirical studies are widely used to assess the effectiveness of testing approaches. However, the design and reporting of empirical studies in QST remain highly diverse, and a shared methodological understanding has yet to emerge, making it difficult to interpret results and compare findings across studies. This paper presents a methodological analysis of empirical studies in QST through a systematic examination of 59 primary studies identified from a literature pool of size 384. We organize our analysis around ten research questions that cover key methodological dimensions of QST empirical studies, including objects under test, baseline comparison, testing setup, experimental configuration, and tool and artifact support. Through cross-study analysis along these dimensions, we characterize current empirical practices in QST, identify recurring limitations and inconsistencies, and highlight open methodological challenges. Based on our findings, we derive insights and recommendations to inform the design, execution, and reporting of future empirical studies in QST."

Despite ongoing efforts, distinguishing the many competing paired phases remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a unified theory of charge transport across a quantum point contact (QPC) for general paired FQH states described by an $so(N)_1 \\times u(1)$ conformal field theory. We derive the boundary effective action for an arbitrary number of Majorana fermions $N=|\\mathcal{C}_{cf}|$ and develop a non-perturbative instanton approximation to describe tunneling processes. We establish a weak-strong duality relating strong quasiparticle tunneling to weak electron tunneling. We calculate the scaling dimensions of the tunneling operators and demonstrate that while the weak-coupling fixed point is generally unstable, the strong-coupling fixed point is stable for physically relevant filling fractions and number of Majorana fermions. These transport exponents provide a distinct experimental fingerprint to identify the topological phases of even-denominator FQH states."

Their three-dimensional (3D) helical architecture and tunable inter-strand coupling enable control of spin chirality, including the stabilization of topological 3D magnetic states such as helical domains and domain walls, topological stray fields, and extended helical vortex/skyrmion tubes. So far, the study of these and other 3D nanostructures is usually confined to a limited number of magnetic microscopy experiments in large facilities. Here, we investigate the reversal mechanism of a single DH nanowire using Dark-Field magneto-optical Kerr effect (DF-MOKE) magnetometry under external 3D magnetic fields. By analyzing the angular dependence of the DF-MOKE signal, we fit the reversal process using established models for domain-wall nucleation and propagation, finding a characteristic behavior similar to that reported for cylindrical nanowires. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the reversal process goes through nucleation of the helical vortex tube in a curling manner while ptychographic X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data reveal that this helical vortex tube state forms through a mixed nucleation-propagation process. These observations provide a consistent microscopic picture of reversal mediated by a helical vortex tube extending along the nanowire. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of magnetization reversal in DH nanowires and demonstrates that DF-MOKE magnetometry is effective for probing reversal mechanisms in single 3D nanostructures. This lab-based approach expands the range of accessible experiments beyond large-scale facilities, enabling extensive exploration of the rich spin states supported by 3D nano-geometries."

    "abstract": "Personality traits influence how individuals engage, behave, and make decisions during the information-seeking process. However, few studies have linked personality to observable search behaviors. This study aims to characterize personality traits through a multimodal time-series model that integrates eye-tracking data and gaze missingness-periods when the user's gaze is not captured. This approach is based on the idea that people often look away when they think, signaling disengagement or reflection. We conducted a user study with 25 participants, who used an interactive application on an iPad, allowing them to engage with digital artifacts from a museum. We rely on raw gaze data from an eye tracker, minimizing preprocessing so that behavioral patterns can be preserved without substantial data cleaning. From this perspective, we trained models to predict personality traits using gaze signals. Our results from a five-fold cross-validation study demonstrate strong predictive performance across all five dimensions: Neuroticism (Macro F1 = 77.69%), Conscientiousness (74.52%), Openness (77.52%), Agreeableness (73.09%), and Extraversion (76.69%). The ablation study examines whether the absence of gaze information affects the model performance, demonstrating that incorporating missingness improves multimodal time-series modeling. The full model, which integrates both time-series signals and missingness information, achieves 10-15% higher accuracy and macro F1 scores across all Big Five traits compared to the model without time-series signals and missingness. These findings provide evidence that personality can be inferred from search-related gaze behavior and demonstrate the value of incorporating missing gaze data into time-series multimodal modeling."

Earlier, such approach was realized for the Kolmogorov widths and very recently for the entropy numbers. It turns out that the above problem is closely related to the sparse approximation problem with respect to different redundant dictionaries. Specifically, the problem of sampling recovery is connected with sparse nonlinear approximation with respect to adaptive dictionaries, which means that the dictionary depends on the function under approximation."

    "abstract": "Incomplete point clouds captured by 3D sensors often result in the loss of both geometric and semantic information. Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment. The source code will be released on GitHub under URL: https://github.com/nizhf/REVNET."

In this work, we focus on monoclonal antibodies and adopt a multi-scale coarse-graining strategy for their modeling, with particular emphasis on the role of electrostatic interactions. Using scattering experiments, theoretical analysis, and large-scale computer simulations, we explicitly compare two selected case studies-markedly different in their charge distributions. Through mutually corroborating lines of evidence, we demonstrate that conventional approaches relying on electrostatic screening and implicit charge representations fail to capture the structural and thermodynamic properties of antibody solutions when strong charge heterogeneity is present, even at a moderate (amino acid) level of coarse-graining. These findings highlight the importance of a correct treatment of electrostatic interactions and ion screening for heterogeneously- and oppositely-charged colloidal and protein systems. Such considerations are essential to move beyond descriptive models towards a truly predictive framework, with direct implications for the formulation of therapeutics and the treatment of other complex soft-matter systems."

    "abstract": "Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity."

We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Our analysis confirms that the LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing this method from random search and highlighting the immense potential of language-driven design in deep learning."

The methodology comprised architectural design, smart contract development, and the implementation of a web-based interface, followed by functional, security, performance, and usability evaluations. Experimental results show that the system correctly supports certificate issuance and public verification, enforces access control, and resists common misuse scenarios. Performance analysis indicates low confirmation latency and negligible transaction costs, making the solution suitable for large-scale academic environments. Additionally, usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS) resulted in a score of 76.67, indicating good user acceptance.

    "abstract": "We introduce Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model to integrate irregular time series and unstructured clinical narratives. We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available."

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation systems must capture implicit user intents from sessions. However, existing models suffer from issues such as item interaction dominance and noisy sessions. We propose a multi-channel recommendation model, including a knowledge graph channel, a session hypergraph channel, and a session line graph channel, to capture information from multiple sources. Our model adaptively removes redundant edges in the knowledge graph channel to reduce noise. Knowledge graph representations cooperate with hypergraph representations for prediction to alleviate item dominance. We also generate in-session attention for denoising. Finally, we maximize mutual information between the hypergraph and line graph channels as an auxiliary task. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the accuracy of various recommendations, including e-commerce and multimedia recommendations. We release the code on GitHub for reproducibility.\\footnote{https://github.com/hohehohe0509/DSR-HK}"

    "abstract": "Scalable trapped-ion quantum computing requires fast and reliable transport of ions through complex, segmented radiofrequency trap architectures without inducing excessive motional excitation. We present a numerical toolchain for the systematic generation of time-dependent electrode voltages enabling fast, low-excitation ion shuttling in segmented radiofrequency traps. Based on a model of the trap electrode geometry, the framework combines an electrostatic field solver, efficient unconstrained optimization, waveform postprocessing, and dynamical simulations of ion motion to compute voltage waveforms that realize prescribed transport trajectories while respecting experimental constraints such as voltage limits and bandwidth. The toolchain supports arbitrary trap geometries, including junctions and multi-zone layouts, and allows for the flexible incorporation of optimization objectives. We provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of the framework by investigating its numerical stability and by comparing measured and predicted secular frequencies. The framework is optimized for numerical performance, enabling rapid numerical prototyping of trap architectures of increasing complexity. As application examples, we apply the framework to the transport of a potential well along a linear, uniformly segmented trap, and we compute a solution for shuttling a potential well around the corner of an X-type trap junction. The presented approach provides an extensible and highly efficient numerical foundation for designing and validating transport protocols in current and next-generation trapped-ion processors."

    "abstract": "Safety-aligned language models systematically refuse harmful requests. While activation steering can modulate refusal, ablating the raw \"refusal vector\" calculated from contrastive harmful and harmless prompts often causes collateral damage and distribution drift. We argue this degradation occurs because the raw vector is polysemantic, entangling the refusal signal with core capability circuits and linguistic style. We introduce Surgical Refusal Ablation (SRA) to distill these steering directions. SRA constructs a registry of independent Concept Atoms representing protected capabilities and stylistic confounds, then uses ridge-regularized spectral residualization to orthogonalize the refusal vector against these directions. This yields a clean refusal direction that targets refusal-relevant structure while minimizing disruption to the model's semantic geometry. Across five models (Qwen3-VL and Ministral series), SRA achieves deep refusal reduction (0-2%) with negligible perplexity impact on Wikitext-2 (mean delta PPL approx. 0.02) and minimal distribution drift. Notably, standard ablation on Qwen3-VL-4B induces severe drift (first-token KL = 2.088), whereas SRA maintains the original distribution (KL = 0.044) while achieving the same 0% refusal rate. Using teacher-forced perplexity on GSM8K and MBPP as a high-resolution capability proxy, we show SRA preserves math and code distributions. These results suggest that common \"model damage\" is often \"Ghost Noise,\" defined as the spectral bleeding of the dirty refusal direction into capability subspaces."

    "abstract": "Influence diagrams represent decision-making problems with interdependencies between random events, decisions, and consequences. Traditionally, they have been solved using algorithms that determine the expected utility-maximizing decision strategy. In contrast, state-of-the-art solution approaches convert influence diagrams into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved with powerful off-the-shelf MILP solvers. From a computational standpoint, the existing MILP formulations can be efficiently solved when applied to influence diagrams that represent periodic (or sequential) decision processes, which can be cast as partially observable Markov Decision Processes. However, they are inefficient in problems that lack a periodic structure or if the nodes in the influence diagram have large state spaces, thus limiting their practical use. In this paper, we present an efficient MILP formulation that is specifically designed for influence diagrams that are challenging for the earlier MILP formulation-based methods. Additionally, we present how the proposed formulation can be adapted to maximize conditional value-at-risk and how chance and logical constraints can be incorporated into the formulation, thus retaining the modeling flexibility of the MILP-based methods. Finally, we perform computational experiments addressing problems from the literature and compare the computational efficiency of the proposed formulation against the available MILP formulations for the reported influence diagrams. We find that the MILP models based on the proposed formulations can be solved significantly more efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art when solving influence diagrams that cannot be cast as partially observable Markov decision processes."

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space.

A simple analytical model is used to interpret the results, and to construct Wigner delays and Wigner distributions for both gauges and relativistic channels of the photoelectron ($εp_j$ with $j=1/2$ and $3/2$). The two gauges are found to produce qualitatively different ionization dynamics, with LG having positive and VG having negative Wigner delays. The advancement of several femtoseconds, found for Wigner delays in VG, raises some concern for causality when atoms are ionized by attosecond pulses that are shorter than the absolute value of the Wigner delay. Reassuringly, numerical simulations of wave packets with RTDCIS show that the electrons behave in a causal way in both gauges. Weighted delays that take into account the temporal window of excitation (or the bandwidth of the pulses) are constructed from the Wigner distribution to reach agreement between the numerical simulations and our simple wave packet model. Furthermore, a strong effect of spin-orbit coupling of the photoelectron ($j$) is reported for ultrafast photoionization dynamics, and Schrödinger kitten and cat states are identified in the Wigner distributions as a result of the ACM. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding of ultrafast photoionization and the role of causality in systems with strong electron-electron correlation effects."

We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms. Furthermore, period-level latency prediction and classification enable adaptive transmission strategies by identifying upcoming periods where application latency requirements cannot be satisfied, necessitating the use of alternative systems."

An important tool is a formula of integration by parts for mixed octonionic Monge-Ampère operator. Various useful properties of octonionic relative extremal functions and octonionic capacity are established. The main difficulty is the non-associativity of octonions. However, some weak form of associativity can be used to covercome this difficulty. Another important ingredient in pluripotential theory is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous octonionic Monge-Ampère equation on the unit ball, for which we show the $C_{loc}^{1,1}$-regularity by applying Bedford-Taylor's method. The obstacle to do so is that an OPSH function is usually not OPSH under automorphisms of the unit ball. This issue can be solved by finding a weighted transformation formula of OPSH functions."

We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023.

Together, these components enable stable policy optimization and align local memory operations with the long-term utility of memory.

In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior task execution efficiency and command understanding capabilities in simulated environments.

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their potential as educational tutors. However, different tutoring strategies benefit different student personalities, and mismatches can be counterproductive to student outcomes. Despite this, current LLM tutoring systems do not take into account student personality traits. To address this problem, we first construct a taxonomy that links pedagogical methods to personality profiles, based on pedagogical literature. We simulate student-teacher conversations and use our framework to let the LLM tutor adjust its strategy to the simulated student personality. We evaluate the scenario with human teachers and find that they consistently prefer our approach over two baselines. Our method also increases the use of less common, high-impact strategies such as role-playing, which human and LLM annotators prefer significantly. Our findings pave the way for developing more personalized and effective LLM use in educational applications."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To overcome challenges in diagnosing pericoronitis on panoramic radiographs, an AI-assisted assessment system integrating anatomical localization, pathological classification, and interpretability. Methods: A two-stage deep learning pipeline was implemented. The first stage used YOLOv8 to detect third molars and classify their anatomical positions and angulations based on Winter's classification. Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis. Radiologists reported 84% alignment between Grad-CAM and their diagnostic impressions, supporting the radiographic relevance of the interpretability output. Conclusion: The system shows strong potential for AI-assisted panoramic assessment, with explainable AI features that support clinical confidence."

    "abstract": "The next great leap in Martian exploration will be the return of samples to Earth. To ensure the maximum scientific return from studying these samples, the development and utilisation of nondestructive analytical techniques are essential to enable early three-dimensional characterisation of their interiors. Neutron computed tomography is a powerful method in this context: it is highly sensitive to hydrogen and complements the more conventional X-ray computed tomography. Because the distribution and nature of hydrous phases are central to understanding the habitability, the climatic and geological evolution, and potential biosignatures of Mars, identifying hydrogenbearing phases in Martian crustal rocks is of particular importance. Using the only Martian crustal material available on Earth, the NWA 7034 meteorite and its pairs, we show that combined neutron and X-ray computed tomography enables non-destructive sample-wide mapping of hydrogen and reveals the distribution and petrographic contexts of hydrous phases. We identify hydrogen-rich iron oxyhydroxides within ancient igneous clasts, forming a macroscopic mineralogical water reservoir within the meteorite. These alteration assemblages closely resemble those observed in samples collected by the Perseverance rover in Jezero crater, where hydrated iron oxyhydroxides are also present. This similarity suggests that such phases may represent a widespread near-surface water reservoir on early Mars."

    "abstract": "The coupled Arctic system is in rapid transition and is set to undergo further dramatic changes over the coming decades. These changes will lead most likely to an ice-free ocean in summer, expected before mid-century. The Arctic will become more strongly influenced by atmospheric and oceanographic processes characteristic of mid-latitudes, increasing the prevalence of contaminants and new biological species. This ongoing transition of the Arctic to a new state necessitates systematic monitoring of all sentinels (variables that make an essential contribution to characterizing the Earth's state) to improve our understanding of the system, enhance forecasting and support knowledge-based decisions. Here, we describe a sustained multi-decadal observation program to be implemented on the Tara Polar Station between 2026 and 2046. The monitoring program is designed as a series of year-long drift expeditions, called Tara Polaris, in the central Arctic Ocean, covering all seasons. The multidisciplinary data will bridge ecological, geochemical, biological, and physical parameters and processes in the atmosphere, sea ice and ocean. In addition, data collected with consistent methodologies over a 20-year period will make it possible to distinguish long-term trends from seasonal and interannual variability. In this paper, we discuss specific measurement challenges in each compartment (i.e., atmosphere, sea ice and ocean) along key sentinels and the most pressing scientific questions to be addressed. The expected outcomes of the Tara Polaris program will enable us to understand and quantify the main feedbacks of the coupled Arctic system, with their seasonal and interannual trends and spatial variability."

    "abstract": "Many stellar systems exhibit a finite spatial extent, yet constructing self-consistent spherical models with a prescribed outer boundary is non-trivial because sharp density cutoffs introduce discontinuities that lead to inconsistencies in the associated distribution function. In this paper we show that these difficulties arise from the abruptness of the truncation rather than from the finite extent itself. We introduce a general and infinitely differentiable radial truncation scheme that can be applied to any density profile, and illustrate its behaviour using the Hernquist model. We find that softly truncated models are dynamically consistent provided that the truncation is sufficiently gradual, and we determine the corresponding critical truncation sharpness. Their distribution functions display a characteristic bump-dip feature near the truncation energy that signals the transition between consistent and inconsistent cases. In contrast to sharply truncated models, softly truncated systems can support an extensive family of Osipkov-Merritt orbital structures, including moderately radial ones. Soft truncations therefore offer a general and physically motivated route to constructing finite-extent dynamical models with well-controlled outer-edge behaviour."

This fundamental notion can be used to model applications arising in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from machine learning to formal language theory. In this work, we study functional decomposition by leveraging on the notion of functional reconfiguration. In this setting, constraints are imposed not only on the factor functions $f_1,\\dots,f_k$ but also on the intermediate functions arising during the composition process. We introduce a symbolic framework to address functional reconfiguration and decomposition problems. In our framework, functions arising during the reconfiguration process are represented symbolically, using ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). The function $g$ used to specify the reconfiguration process is represented by a Boolean circuit $C$. Finally, the function class $\\mathcal{F}$ is represented by a second-order finite automaton $\\mathcal{A}$. Our main result states that functional reconfiguration, and hence functional decomposition, can be solved in fixed-parameter linear time when parameterized by the width of the input OBDD, by structural parameters associated with the reconfiguration circuit $C$, and by the size of the second-order finite automaton $\\mathcal{A}$."

Embracing renewable energy is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic move with multiple benefits. By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information. Our results demonstrate lower transaction time by 41\\% and energy consumption by 65\\% compared to proof-of-stake."

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis."

Beyond prompting or fine-tuning, , i.e.,~manipulating internal representations during inference, has emerged as a more efficient and interpretable technique for adapting models to a target language. Yet, no dedicated benchmarks or evaluation protocols exist to quantify the effectiveness of steering techniques. We introduce CLaS-Bench, a lightweight parallel-question benchmark for evaluating language-forcing behavior in LLMs across 32 languages, enabling systematic evaluation of multilingual steering methods. We evaluate a broad array of steering techniques, including residual-stream DiffMean interventions, probe-derived directions, language-specific neurons, PCA/LDA vectors, Sparse Autoencoders, and prompting baselines. Steering performance is measured along two axes: language control and semantic relevance, combined into a single harmonic-mean steering score. We find that across languages simple residual-based DiffMean method consistently outperforms all other methods. Moreover, a layer-wise analysis reveals that language-specific structure emerges predominantly in later layers and steering directions cluster based on language family. CLaS-Bench is the first standardized benchmark for multilingual steering, enabling both rigorous scientific analysis of language representations and practical evaluation of steering as a low-cost adaptation alternative."

This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines."

The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object.

    "abstract": "Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.

We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses. Overall, in this species, zero-shot deep local-feature matching outperformed global-feature embedding and provides a strong default for photo-identification."

Attosecond qubits can be prepared, coherently manipulated, and read out using existing attosecond techniques, providing a compact Hilbert-space description of strong-field dynamics beyond semiclassical trajectory pictures. A density-matrix formulation makes explicit the roles of coherence, dephasing, and decoherence, arising from continuum propagation, Coulomb interaction, infrared dressing, and macroscopic averaging, within a reduced description that remains far from thermalization.

    "abstract": "As is well known, near-horizon (equivalently high acceleration) observers in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes have a particularly simple form of the quasi-local energy. Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed. The resulting low-entropic condensed state, where the quanta are essentially all in the lowest Bose energy state, provides the framework for the quantization of near-horizon geometric fluctuations, which is explored in a companion paper."

    "abstract": "Quantum tomography involves obtaining a full classical description of a prepared quantum state from experimental results. We propose a Langevin sampler for quantum tomography, that relies on a new formulation of Bayesian quantum tomography exploiting the Burer-Monteiro factorization of Hermitian positive-semidefinite matrices. If the rank of the target density matrix is known, this formulation allows us to define a posterior distribution that is only supported on matrices whose rank is upper-bounded by the rank of the target density matrix. Conversely, if the target rank is unknown, any upper bound on the rank can be used by our algorithm, and the rank of the resulting posterior mean estimator is further reduced by the use of a low-rank promoting prior density. This prior density is a complex extension of the one proposed in (Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare Probability and Statistics, 56(2):1465-1483, 2020). We derive a PAC-Bayesian bound on our proposed estimator that matches the best bounds available in the literature, and we show numerically that it leads to strong scalability improvements compared to existing techniques when the rank of the density matrix is known to be small."

    "abstract": "To improve efficiency, nearly all parallel processing units (CPUs and GPUs) implement relaxed memory models in which memory operations may be re-ordered, i.e., executed out-of-order. Prior testing work in this area found that memory re-orderings are observed more frequently when other cores are active, e.g., stressing the memory system, which likely triggers aggressive hardware optimizations. In this work, we present Memory DisOrder: a timerless side-channel that uses memory re-orderings to infer activity on other processes. We first perform a fuzzing campaign and show that many mainstream processors (X86/Arm/Apple CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD/Apple GPUs) are susceptible to cross-process signals. We then show how the vulnerability can be used to implement classic attacks, including a covert channel, achieving up to 16 bits/second with 95% accuracy on an Apple M3 GPU, and application fingerprinting, achieving reliable closed-world DNN architecture fingerprinting on several CPUs and an Apple M3 GPU. Finally, we explore how low-level system details can be exploited to increase re-orderings, showing the potential for a covert channel to achieve nearly 30K bits/second on X86 CPUs. More precise attacks can likely be developed as the vulnerability becomes better understood."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale."

In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets."

Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality.

We introduce FRTR-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark for multimodal spreadsheet reasoning, comprising 30 enterprise-grade Excel workbooks spanning nearly four million cells and more than 50 embedded images. To address these challenges, we present From Rows to Reasoning (FRTR), an advanced, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that decomposes Excel workbooks into granular row, column, and block embeddings, employs hybrid lexical-dense retrieval with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and integrates multimodal embeddings to reason over both numerical and visual information. We tested FRTR on six LLMs, achieving 74% answer accuracy on FRTR-Bench with Claude Sonnet 4.5, a substantial improvement over prior state-of-the-art approaches that reached only 24%. On the SpreadsheetLLM benchmark, FRTR achieved 87% accuracy with GPT-5 while reducing token usage by roughly 50% compared to context-compression methods."

    "abstract": "The canonical model of stochastic search tracks a randomly diffusing \"searcher\" until it finds a \"target.\" Owing to its many applications across science and engineering, this perennially popular problem has been thoroughly investigated in a variety of models. However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or \"heterogeneous\" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the Itô-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation."

However, many practical KGs are private, and sending retrieved triples or exploration traces to closed-source LLM APIs introduces leakage risk. Existing privacy treatments focus on masking entity names, but they still face four limitations: structural leakage under semantic masking, uncontrollable remote interaction, fragile multi-hop and multi-entity reasoning, and limited experience reuse for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose PrivGemo, a privacy-preserving retrieval-augmented framework for KG-grounded reasoning with memory-guided exposure control. PrivGemo uses a dual-tower design to keep raw KG knowledge local while enabling remote reasoning over an anonymized view that goes beyond name masking to limit both semantic and structural exposure. PrivGemo supports multi-hop, multi-entity reasoning by retrieving anonymized long-hop paths that connect all topic entities, while keeping grounding and verification on the local KG. A hierarchical controller and a privacy-aware experience memory further reduce unnecessary exploration and remote interactions. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmarks show that PrivGemo achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 17.1%. Furthermore, PrivGemo enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo."

Additionally, we note threats to the validity of the empirical study, related to the ground truth ordering of test suites. Through our empirical validation, we substantiate our claims and propose improvements for future DNN coverage metrics. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of these insights."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks."

It is reasonable to suppose that the stronger the quantum fluctuation in such an antiferromagnet, the greater the reduction in its ordered moment would become, but this supposition has not yet been confirmed because quantifying the strength of quantum fluctuation is not a straightforward matter. Here we show that the local magnetic excitations involving the QFEs can be used to quantify the strength of quantum fluctuation by analyzing six antiferromagnets showing significant reduction in their ordered spin moments."

Conventional neural models learn statistical correspondences between names and nationalities from task-specific training data, posing challenges in generalizing to low-frequency nationalities and distinguishing similar nationalities within the same region. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address these challenges by leveraging world knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this study, we comprehensively compare neural models and LLMs on nationality prediction, evaluating six neural models and six LLM prompting strategies across three granularity levels (nationality, region, and continent), with frequency-based stratified analysis and error analysis. Results show that LLMs outperform neural models at all granularity levels, with the gap narrowing as granularity becomes coarser. Simple machine learning methods exhibit the highest frequency robustness, while pre-trained models and LLMs show degradation for low-frequency nationalities. Error analysis reveals that LLMs tend to make ``near-miss'' errors, predicting the correct region even when nationality is incorrect, whereas neural models exhibit more cross-regional errors and bias toward high-frequency classes. These findings indicate that LLM superiority stems from world knowledge, model selection should consider required granularity, and evaluation should account for error quality beyond accuracy."

To address this issue, we propose the SEquential Evolutionary Transfer Optimization (SEETO) algorithm driven by the representations of the meteorological state. First, to accurately measure the physical similarity between calibration tasks, a meteorological state representation extractor is introduced to map high-dimensional meteorological fields into latent representations. Second, given the similarity in the latent space, a bi-level adaptive knowledge transfer mechanism is designed. At the solution level, superior populations from similar historical tasks are reused to achieve a \"warm start\" for optimization. At the model level, an ensemble surrogate model based on source task data is constructed to assist the search, employing an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically balance the contributions of source domain knowledge and target domain data. Extensive experiments across 10 distinct calibration tasks, which span varying source-target similarities, highlight SEETO's superior efficiency. Under a strict budget of 20 expensive evaluations, SEETO achieves a 6% average improvement in Hypervolume (HV) over two state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, to match SEETO's performance at this stage, the comparison algorithms would require an average of 64% and 28% additional evaluations, respectively. This presents a new paradigm for the efficient and accurate automated calibration of NWP model parameters."

    "abstract": "The potential for drone delivery services to transform logistics systems and consumer behavior has gained increasing attention. However, comprehensive empirical evidence on consumer delivery choice behavior within the context of transportation and urban air logistics remains limited, particularly in Japan. This study addresses this gap by examining Japanese consumers' preferences and behavioral intentions toward drone delivery services. Using a stated preference (SP) survey and discrete choice modeling approaches, including multinomial logit (MNL) and mixed logit (MMNL) models, the analysis evaluates how delivery cost, delivery time, drop-off location, product type, and social influence affect delivery mode choices across different demographic groups. The results indicate that although consumers express interest in drone delivery, perceived cost and concerns related to reliability continue to constrain adoption. Younger and male consumers exhibit higher preferences for drone delivery, while product type, particularly daily consumer goods and medical or healthcare items, plays a significant role in shaping preferences. Post-estimation willingness-to-pay and elasticity analyses further highlight consumers' sensitivity to delivery pricing and speed attributes. Overall, the findings provide actionable insights for logistics service providers and policymakers regarding pricing strategies, service targeting, and deployment approaches for integrating drone delivery into Japan's evolving logistics system."

We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations."

Based on an exact decomposition of total energies from Kohn--Sham density functional theory in a basis of spatially localized molecular orbitals, the present work outlines a robust protocol for sampling the effect of solvation within homogeneous condensed phases by focusing on perturbations to local electronic structures only. We report chemically intuitive results for binding energies of water, ethanol, and acetonitrile that all display fast convergence with respect to the bulk size. Results stay largely invariant with respect to the choice of basis set while reflecting differences in density functional approximations, and our protocol thus allows for a physically sound and efficient estimation of general effects related to bulk solvation."

Formulating the problem in terms of a Riesz representer enables stable estimation and a transparent decomposition of omitted variable bias into three interpretable components: a data-identified scale factor, outcome confounding strength, and selection confounding strength. For estimation, we employ the ForestRiesz estimator, which accounts for selective outcome observability while avoiding the instability associated with direct propensity score inversion. We assess finite-sample performance through a simulation study and show that conventional double machine learning approaches can be highly sensitive to tuning parameters due to their reliance on inverse probability weighting, whereas the ForestRiesz estimator delivers more stable performance by leveraging automatic debiased machine learning. In an empirical application to the gender wage gap in the U.S., we find that our ForestRiesz approach yields larger treatment effect estimates than a standard double machine learning approach, suggesting that ignoring sample selection leads to an underestimation of the gender wage gap. Sensitivity analysis indicates that implausibly strong unobserved confounding would be required to overturn our results. Overall, our approach provides a unified, robust, and computationally attractive framework for causal inference under sample selection."

Specifically, modifying utilities at a total cost of at most $0.81 ε^2 \\cdot \\texttt{opt}$ guarantees that every resulting Nash equilibrium achieves a social welfare of at least $ε\\cdot \\texttt{opt}$, where $\\texttt{opt}$ is the optimum social welfare.

    "abstract": "The launch of \\$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data. To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \\$500,000 across these projects."

The resonances appear as conductance oscillations with gating. Here, we show coupling between the KARS in BSCCO-graphene-BSCCO devices of varying separation (L). The coupling is evidenced by a power-law decay of resonance period as L increases from tens of nanometers to single microns. These results demonstrate the long-distance coupling of KARS cavities in graphene-HTS junctions. The length dependence seen in experiments is supported by single-particle spectral functions which show KARS are coupled by transport modes in graphene. The strong coupling between KARS in BSCCO-graphene-BSCCO junctions showcases the novelty of HTS-graphene junctions for quantum circuits and unconventional Josephson junctions."

We further propose a diagnostic framework that evaluates models beyond recovery accuracy, including semantic fidelity, logical validity, consistency, robustness sensitivity, and information density. Experiments on twelve widely used LLMs show that structural reconstruction remains difficult even for frontier systems: zero-shot recovery frequently falls below 35%. We also observe a consistent dissociation between semantic recall and structural planning, suggesting that structural robustness is not an automatic byproduct of semantic competence."

This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model. In particular, we address the variational limit from a potential with a logarithmic contribution to a double-obstacle potential, then also allowing for the emergence of pure phases. This study underlines that, thanks to its structure, the energy-variational solution is better suited for variational convergence methods than the dissipative solution."

    "abstract": "Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

    "abstract": "For automated assessment of knee MRI scans, both accuracy and interpretability are essential for clinical use and adoption. Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation."

In the mixed case, each $p$-interaction layer is assumed either to have regularly varying tails with exponent $α_p$ or to satisfy a finite $2p$-th moment condition. For the pure spherical $p$-spin model with regularly varying disorder of tail index $α$, we introduce a tail-adapted normalization that interpolates between the classical Gaussian scaling and the extreme-value scale, and we prove a sharp universality dichotomy for the quenched free energy. In the subcritical regime $α<2p$, the thermodynamics is driven by finitely many extremal couplings and the free energy converges to a non-degenerate random limit described by the NIM (non-intersecting monomial) model, depending only on extreme-order statistics. At the critical exponent $α=2p$, we obtain a random one-dimensional TAP-type variational formula capturing the coexistence of an extremal spike and a universal Gaussian bulk on spherical slices. In the supercritical regime $α>2p$ (more generally, under a finite $2p$-th moment assumption), the free energy is universal and agrees with the deterministic Crisanti--Sommers/Parisi value of the corresponding Gaussian model, as established in [Sawhney-Sellke'24]. We then extend the subcritical and critical results to mixed spherical models in which each $p$-layer is either heavy-tailed with $α_p\\le 2p$ or has finite $2p$-th moment. In particular, we derive a TAP-type variational representation for the mixed model, yielding a unified universality classification of the quenched free energy across tail exponents and mixtures."

We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 μm and peaks at 1.5-2.0 μm, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks."

We study regime-dependent dynamics in developed and developing equity indices using a data-driven Hilbert--Huang-based regime identification and profiling pipeline, followed by variable-length Markov modeling of categorized returns. Market regimes are identified using an Empirical Mode Decomposition-based Hilbert--Huang Transform, where instantaneous energy from the Hilbert spectrum separates Normal, High, and Extreme regimes. We then profile each regime using Holo--Hilbert Spectral Analysis, which jointly resolves carrier frequencies, amplitude-modulation frequencies, and amplitude-modulation energy (AME). AME, interpreted as volatility intensity, declines monotonically from Extreme to High to Normal regimes. This decline is markedly sharper in developed markets, while developing markets retain higher baseline volatility intensity even in Normal regimes. Building on these regime-specific volatility signatures, we discretize daily returns into five quintile states $\\mathtt{R}_1$ to $\\mathtt{R}_5$ and estimate Variable-Length Markov Chains via context trees within each regime. Unconditional state probabilities show tail states dominate in Extreme regimes and recede as regimes stabilize, alongside persistent downside asymmetry. Entropy peaks in High regimes, indicating maximum unpredictability during moderate-volatility periods. Conditional transition dynamics, evaluated over contexts of length up to three days from the context-tree estimates, indicate that developed markets normalize more effectively as stress subsides, whereas developing markets retain residual tail dependence and downside persistence even in Normal regimes, consistent with a coexistence of continuation and burst-like shifts."

However, they are also increasingly used for targeted attacks, posing a significant safety challenge and necessitating the development of drone detection systems. Vision-based drone detection systems currently have an accuracy limitation and struggle to distinguish between drones and birds, particularly when the birds are small in size. This research work proposes a novel YOLOBirDrone architecture that improves the detection and classification accuracy of birds and drones. YOLOBirDrone has different components, including an adaptive and extended layer aggregation (AELAN), a multi-scale progressive dual attention module (MPDA), and a reverse MPDA (RMPDA) to preserve shape information and enrich features with local and global spatial and channel information. A large-scale dataset, BirDrone, is also introduced in this article, which includes small and challenging objects for robust aerial object identification. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement in performance metrics through the proposed YOLOBirDrone architecture compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, with detection accuracy reaching approximately 85% across various scenarios."

    "abstract": "Background:Subject-specific finite element analysis accurately characterizes knee joint mechanics but is computationally expensive. Deep surrogate models provide a rapid alternative, yet their generalization across subjects under limited pose and load inputs remains unclear. It remains unclear whether the dominant source of prediction uncertainty arises from temporal history dependence or spatial propagation dependence. Methods:To disentangle these factors, we employed a shared MGN backbone with a fixed mesh topology. A dataset of running trials from nine subjects was constructed using an OpenSim-FEBio workflow. We developed four model variants to isolate specific dependencies: (1) a baseline MGN; (2) CT-MGN, incorporating a Control Transformer to encode short-horizon history; (3) MsgModMGN, applying state-conditioned modulation to message passing for adaptive propagation; (4) CT-MsgModMGN, combining both mechanisms. Models were evaluated using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects.Results:The models incorporating history encoding significantly outperformed the baseline MGN and MsgModMGN in global accuracy and spatial consistency. Crucially, the CT module effectively mitigated the peak-shaving defect common in deep surrogates, significantly reducing peak stress prediction errors. In contrast, the spatial propagation modulation alone yielded no significant improvement over the baseline, and combining it with CT provided no additional benefit.Conclusion:Temporal history dependence, rather than spatial propagation modulation, is the primary driver of prediction uncertainty in cross-subject knee contact mechanics. Explicitly encoding short-horizon driver sequences enables the surrogate model to recover implicit phase information, thereby achieving superior fidelity in peak-stress capture and high-risk localization compared to purely state-based approaches."

    "abstract": "We present a spatially dependent framework for the existence and propagation of nonlinear kinetic Alfvén (KA) structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $β$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$β$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$β$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell\" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties. This study establishes a direct link between macroscopic ISM morphology, ion-kinetic scale dissipation, and the emergence of coherent Alfvénic activity, with implications for radio scattering, pulsar scintillation, and fine-scale signatures in astrophysical observations."

    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently shown remarkable promise in low-level visual perception tasks, particularly in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), demonstrating strong zero-shot capability. However, achieving state-of-the-art performance often requires computationally expensive fine-tuning methods, which aim to align the distribution of quality-related token in output with image quality levels. Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment."

    "abstract": "Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by leveraging long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but uniformly applying overlong reasoning at inference time incurs substantial and often unnecessary computational cost. To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance."

To address this challenge, we propose AgriAgent, a two-level agent framework for real-world agriculture. AgriAgent adopts a hierarchical execution strategy based on task complexity: simple tasks are handled through direct reasoning by modality-specific agents, while complex tasks trigger a contract-driven planning mechanism that formulates tasks as capability requirements and performs capability-aware tool orchestration and dynamic tool generation, enabling multi-step and verifiable execution with failure recovery. Experimental results show that AgriAgent achieves higher execution success rates and robustness on complex tasks compared to existing tool-centric agent baselines that rely on unified execution paradigms. All code, data will be released at after our work be accepted to promote reproducible research."

This estimate, however, is based on crater scaling laws for water and sand, which are not representative of the composition of Titan's icy surface. Titan's surface is likely composed of water ice, methane clathrates, or a combination of both. Here, we perform impact simulations for impactors of various sizes that strike an icy target with a 0-15 km thick methane clathrate cap layer. We derive new crater scaling laws based on our numerical results, and find that Titan's surface age is 300-340 Myr, assuming heliocentric impactors and surface clathrates. This age, which represents the crater retention age, indicates a relatively youthful surface, suggesting that active endogenic and/or exogenic processes have recently reshaped Titan's surface."

Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware."

Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost."

To investigate this, we introduce KidVis, a novel benchmark grounded in the theory of human visual development. KidVis deconstructs visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities - Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure - already possessed by 6-7 year old children, comprising 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against a human physiological baseline reveals a stark performance disparity. Results indicate that while human children achieve a near-perfect average score of 95.32, the state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Crucially, we observe a \"Scaling Law Paradox\": simply increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in these foundational visual capabilities. This study confirms that current MLLMs, despite their reasoning prowess, lack the essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence."

    "abstract": "Bell or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests on superconducting quantum processors are commonly interpreted under the assumption that repeated circuit executions sample a single, stationary preparation ensemble. Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \\le 2 + 6δ_{\\mathrm{ens}}$, where $δ_{\\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $δ_{\\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $δ_{\\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling. Our results identify a preparation-dependent loophole relevant to Bell tests on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and highlight the necessity of drift-aware protocols for reliable quantum certification."

We tested whether training attention under sensory competition produces lasting changes in perceived contrast. Across seven days, participants trained on an orientation task with a fixed target location, with or without a salient distractor. Before and after training, we measured the point of subjective equality (PSE). Training under competition produced a reliable push-pull shift. Stimuli at the trained location appeared higher in contrast, whereas stimuli at the untrained location appeared lower. Conversely, training without distractors improved performance but did not alter appearance. Crucially, these opponent shifts were robust to task variations, persisting even in equality judgments designed to minimize response bias. Furthermore, the effect generalized to stimuli with novel orientation and contrast levels. These findings demonstrate that resolving sensory competition does not merely improve discrimination, but durably recalibrates the subjective appearance of the visual world."

Experiments on the real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark demonstrate superior performance. Notably, ToolACE-MCP exhibits critical properties for the future Agent Web: it not only generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation but also maintains exceptional robustness against noise and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces. These findings provide a strong empirical foundation for universal orchestration in open-ended ecosystems."

Employing various progenitor masses and the nuclear equations of states, we find that the effect of FFC on CCSN explosion is bifurcated depending on the progenitors. For the lowest-mass progenitor, FFC facilitates the shock revival and enhances the explosion energy, whereas for higher-mass progenitors its impact is inhibitory. We identify the mass accretion rate as the key determinant governing this bifurcation. When the mass accretion rate is low (high), the contribution of FFC to neutrino heating becomes positive (negative), because the heating efficiency enhancement via FFC-driven spectral hardening of electron-type neutrinos dominates over (is outweighed by) the concurrent reduction in neutrino luminosity. Our results further highlight the limitations of approximate neutrino transport, and demonstrate that a multi-angle treatment is essential for accurately capturing FFC effects; otherwise, FFCs are missed and even generated spuriously."

In this work, we determine the exact extremal values of these divergences over the unitary orbits of two quantum states. Using the integral representation of operator convex functions, majorization theory, Lidskii-type inequalities, and structural properties of Kubo-Ando means, we derive fully explicit spectral formulas for \\[ \\min_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(ρ\\|U^{*}σU) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\max_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(ρ\\|U^{*}σU), \\] and identify the unitaries achieving these extrema. We show that the optimization reduces to spectral rearrangement: the minimum occurs when the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ and $σ$ are paired, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $ρ$ with the increasing spectrum of $σ$. Consequently, the full range of the divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval between these two endpoints. We further compare our results with the recent unitary optimization framework for hockey-stick-based quantum $f$-divergences of Li and Yan (2025), highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two families. Our findings extend prior extremal analyses for Umegaki, Rényi, and Hellinger-type divergences, and illuminate the distinct noncommutative nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences."

This coupling creates a unique synergy wherein the fluid solver leverages MFEM's distributed-memory parallelization and pathway to GPU acceleration, while the immersed solid exploits FEBio's comprehensive suite of hyperelastic and viscoelastic constitutive models and advanced solid mechanics modeling targeted for biomechanics applications. FSI coupling is achieved using a fictitious domain methodology with variational multiscale stabilization for enhanced accuracy on under-resolved grids expected with unfitted meshes used in immersed FSI. A fully implicit, monolithic scheme provides robust coupling for strongly coupled FSI characteristic of cardiovascular applications. The framework's modular architecture facilitates straightforward extension to additional physics and element technologies. Several test problems are considered to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, including a 3D semilunar heart valve simulation.

Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods."

However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications."

Each dimer consists of a high-contrast dielectric nanoparticle and a moderately contrasting plasmonic nanoparticle separated by a subwavelength distance. The cluster is assumed to contain many such dimers whose size $a$ is small compared to the wavelength, with intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances scaling like $a^{t_1}$ and $a^{t_2}$, and the frequency is tuned near suitable electric and magnetic resonances of the associated Newtonian and magnetization operators on the reference shapes. Under these geometric, contrast and spectral assumptions, we derive a Foldy--Lax type approximation for the Maxwell system. We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers. By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions. In particular, it suggests parameter regimes where clusters of hybrid dimers can generate (double) negative effective permittivity and permeability and bi-anisotropic constitutive laws and eventually hyperbolic media."

This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals."

Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI."

    "abstract": "The accretion of icy and rocky solids during the formation of a gas giant planet is poorly constrained and challenging to model. Refractory species, like sulfur, are only present in solids in the protoplanetary disk where planets form. Measuring their abundance in planetary atmospheres is one of the most direct ways of constraining the extent and mechanism of solid accretion. Using the unprecedented sensitivity of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we measure a detailed chemical make-up of three massive gas giants orbiting the star HR~8799 including direct detections of H$_2$O, CO, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, H$_2$S, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O. We find these planets are uniformly and highly enriched in heavy elements compared to the star irrespective of their volatile (carbon and oxygen) or refractory (sulfur) nature, which strongly suggests efficient accretion of solids during their formation. This composition closely resembles that of Jupiter and Saturn and demonstrates that this enrichment also occurs in systems of multiple gas giant planets orbiting stars beyond the Solar System. This discovery hints at a shared origin for the heavy element enrichment of giant planets across a wider range of planet masses and orbital separations than previously anticipated."

    "abstract": "General intelligence must reorganize experience into internal structures that enable prediction and action under finite resources. Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization."

    "abstract": "Federated learning protocols require repeated synchronization between clients and a central server, with convergence rates depending on learning rates, data heterogeneity, and client sampling. This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \\ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\\times$ less communication. The framework applies to kernel methods and random feature models but not to general nonlinear architectures."

However, we find these two factors alone are insufficient to describe an optimal architecture. Through a systematic study, we demonstrate that MoE performance is primarily determined by total parameters ($N_{total}$) and expert sparsity ($s:=n_{exp}/n_{topk}$). Moreover, $n_{exp}$ and $n_{topk}$ do not \"cancel out\" within the sparsity ratio; instead, a larger total number of experts slightly penalizes performance by forcing a reduction in core model dimensions (depth and width) to meet memory constraints. This motivates a simple principle for MoE design which maximizes $N_{total}$ while minimizing $s$ (maximizing $n_{topk}$) and $n_{exp}$ under the given constraints. Our findings provide a robust framework for resolving architectural ambiguity and guiding MoE design."

We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $Γ$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $Γ$. This dynamical process explicitly constructs the identification between the cohomology basis and the irreducible representations of $Γ$ prescribed by the McKay correspondence.

To enforce the Stiefel manifold constraint without introducing the analytical complications of retraction-based updates, we design a fully discrete retraction-free orthonormality-preserving scheme for spatiotemporal HiSD. This scheme exhibits favorable structural properties that substantially reduce the difficulties arising from coupling and gradient nonlinearities in spatiotemporal HiSD. Exploiting these properties, we establish gradient stability and error estimates, which consequently ensure the preservation of the Morse index for the computed saddle points. The framework is further extended to the semilinear advection-reaction-diffusion equation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in finding multiple solutions and constructing the solution landscape of semilinear elliptic problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first rigorous full space--time accuracy analysis of the HiSD system. It reveals intrinsic connections between saddle-search algorithms and numerical methods for PDEs, enhancing their mutual compatibility for a broad range of problems."

They have shown strong performance across domains, yet their internal representations and learned concepts remain poorly understood. This lack of interpretability makes it important to study how these models process and transform input features. In this work, we analyze the information encoded inside the model's hidden representations and examine how these representations evolve across layers. We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models. They show that these models encode concrete and interpretable information, which moves us closer to making their decision processes more transparent and trustworthy."

Recent work using causal mediation analysis has shown that a small set of attention heads encodes task representation in in-context learning, captured in a compact representation known as the function vector. We show that fine-tuning function vectors with only a small set of examples (about 20 word pairs) yields better performance on relation-based word-completion tasks than using the original vectors derived from causal mediation analysis. These improvements hold for both small and large language models. Moreover, the fine-tuned function vectors yield improved decoding performance for relation words and show stronger alignment with human similarity judgments of semantic relations. Next, we introduce the composite function vector - a weighted combination of fine-tuned function vectors - to extract relational knowledge and support analogical reasoning. At inference time, inserting this composite vector into LLM activations markedly enhances performance on challenging analogy problems drawn from cognitive science and SAT benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of activation patching as a controllable mechanism for encoding and manipulating relational knowledge, advancing both the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of large language models."

Here we investigate the origin of the near-yearly periodicity in 2 Dra, a star located in the red-clump region, assessing possible causes between stellar activity, instrumental profile (IP) effects, sampling alias, and planetary companions. We applied two independent approaches: (1) constraining diagnostic signals and performing a correlation analysis ($r$) between period-confined signals, and (2) evaluating phase stability by partitioning Keplerian fits. These methods enabled us to examine the physical connections and phase coherence among stellar activity indicators, RV measurements, and IP diagnostics. Our analysis suggests a stellar rotation period of $\\simeq270\\text{--}320$\\,d for 2~Dra. The 340-d RV signal does not appear to originate from stellar activity in this chromospherically quiet star ($|r| \\lesssim 0.33$), nor from instrumental systematics near the annual period ($|r| \\lesssim 0.1$). This conclusion is supported by contrasting phase behavior: the RV and stellar activity phases remain stable, whereas the IP phases do not. We therefore propose that the 340-d variation likely arises from either small-amplitude intrinsic variability or a tentative gas giant companion with potential weak activity-induced modulation. The case of 2~Dra provides a framework for distinguishing the origins of $\\sim$1-yr RV variations in other evolved stars."

Unlike previous methods that modify the continuity equation, our approach strictly preserves mass conservation while creating a degenerate hyperbolic boundary at the cut-off density $ρ=δ$. We provide a rigorous derivation of the eigenstructure and Riemann invariants for the perturbed system. A key theoretical contribution is the proof that the perturbed pressure exactly inherits the convexity properties of the original state equation ($2\\tilde{P}'+ρ\\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+ρP''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical energy entropy without additional assumptions. Using the method of vanishing viscosity, we derive uniform $L^\\infty$ bounds via invariant regions and establish the $H^{-1}_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ compactness of entropy dissipation measures. The global existence for the vacuum-free limit is then proved using the theory of compensated compactness and singular perturbation analysis of the entropy equations."

This correspondence has been fruitful in uncovering lattice structures in the triangulations. We start by showing that this correspondence is actually a linear isomorphism. We then consider flow cones of certain graphs with cycles. For this case, we give a DKK-like triangulation of the cone, and extend the correspondence to the finite $g$-vector fan of a corresponding locally gentle quiver. In addition, we extend to cyclic graphs a mysterious result of Postnikov--Stanley and Baldoni--Vergne, giving the volume of flow polytopes of acyclic graphs as the number of certain integer flows on the same graph. We illustrate our results with a two-parameter family of cyclic graphs that includes a cycle graph and nested 2-cycles as special cases. We show that the fans of its DKK-like triangulations are respectively isomorphic to the normal fan of the cyclohedron and of a new polytope with the same $f$-vector but different combinatorial type than the permutahedron."

This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities.

    "abstract": "When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites."

    "abstract": "We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation with tool-calling agents (agentic RAG) has become increasingly powerful in understanding, processing, and responding to user queries. However, the scope of the grounding knowledge is limited and asking questions that exceed this scope may lead to issues like hallucination. While guardrail frameworks aim to block out-of-scope questions (Rodriguez et al., 2024), no research has investigated the question of suggesting answerable queries in order to complete the user interaction. In this paper, we initiate the study of query suggestion for agentic RAG. We consider the setting where user questions are not answerable, and the suggested queries should be similar to aid the user interaction. Such scenarios are frequent for tool-calling LLMs as communicating the restrictions of the tools or the underlying datasets to the user is difficult, and adding query suggestions enhances the interaction with the RAG agent. As opposed to traditional settings for query recommendations such as in search engines, ensuring that the suggested queries are answerable is a major challenge due to the RAG's multi-step workflow that demands a nuanced understanding of the RAG as a whole, which the executing LLM lacks. As such, we introduce robust dynamic few-shot learning which retrieves examples from relevant workflows. We show that our system can be self-learned, for instance on prior user queries, and is therefore easily applicable in practice. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets based on two unlabeled question datasets collected from real-world user queries. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces more relevant and answerable suggestions, outperforming few-shot and retrieval-only baselines, and thus enable safer, more effective user interaction with agentic RAG."

    "abstract": "Understanding the generalization behavior of deep neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in modern statistical learning theory. Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning."

    "abstract": "Invisible watermarking has become a critical mechanism for authenticating AI-generated image content, with major platforms deploying watermarking schemes at scale. However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets."

We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model.

We demonstrate that, while the method yields spurious critical points in purely hadronic models (HRG) due to non-parabolic contour behavior at low temperatures ($T \\lesssim 120$ MeV), it accurately reproduces the CP location in frameworks that feature a genuine phase transition and benchmarked against lattice QCD, such as Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton, and Functional QCD approaches. Building on our previous determination of constant entropy contours using lattice data, we extend that analysis to construct a complete Lattice-based Equation of State (EoS) at finite density, which features a critical point at $(T, μ_B) \\approx (114, 602)$ MeV. By integrating the extrapolated entropy density with respect to temperature, we reconstruct the pressure, baryon density, susceptibility, and speed of sound in the critical region, and analyze the focusing behavior of isentropic trajectories in the vicinity of the critical point."

The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay. We describe the dynamics of such decay and derive the gravitational wave spectrum for a set of benchmark parameters. Interestingly, the signal may peak at interferometer scales and lie within LISA's projected sensitivity."

    "abstract": "We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\\sim}72\\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\\sim}38\\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."

They are excellent temperature probes of the corresponding astronomical regions and are thought to be the origin of many unknown lines in astronomical survey spectra. Rovibrational spectra provide accurate vibrational energies and can guide subsequent pure rotational studies. The Automated Spectral Assignment Procedure (ASAP) greatly simplifies the rovibrational analysis when the rotational spectrum of either the upper or lower vibrational state is known with a high degree of accuracy (e.g., from a rotational analysis). Here, we present a new implementation of ASAP for the analysis of cyclopentadiene, a cyclic pure hydrocarbon that has already been detected astronomically toward the cold core of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. Using the synchrotron radiation extracted by the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL facility, we recorded mid- and far-infrared high-resolution spectra of cyclopentadiene. We analyzed the rovibrational spectrum of the $ν_{21}$ fundamental (961 cm$^{-1}$) with ASAP and used ASAP$^2$ to determine the vibrational energies of the eight vibrational modes below 860 cm$^{-1}$. ASAP$^2$ is an extension of ASAP for rovibrational bands where the rotational structures of the lower and upper states are known with high accuracy, leaving only the vibrational band center to be determined. The presented rovibrational fingerprints agree with the results from pure rotational spectroscopy, demonstrating the efficiency and reliability of our new ASAP implementation."

    "abstract": "As a well-known community detection algorithm, Leiden has been widely used in various scenarios such as large language model generation (e.g., Graph-RAG), anomaly detection, and biological analysis. In these scenarios, the graphs are often large and dynamic, where vertices and edges are inserted and deleted frequently, so it is costly to obtain the updated communities by Leiden from scratch when the graph has changed. Recently, one work has attempted to study how to maintain Leiden communities in the dynamic graph, but it lacks a detailed theoretical analysis, and its algorithms are inefficient for large graphs. To address these issues, in this paper, we first theoretically show that the existing algorithms are relatively unbounded via the boundedness analysis (a powerful tool for analyzing incremental algorithms on dynamic graphs), and also analyze the memberships of vertices in communities when the graph changes. Based on theoretical analysis, we develop a novel efficient maintenance algorithm, called Hierarchical Incremental Tree Leiden (HIT-Leiden), which effectively reduces the range of affected vertices by maintaining the connected components and hierarchical community structures. Comprehensive experiments in various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HIT-Leiden. In particular, it achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude over existing methods."

We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information.

Applied to U.S.\\ mathematics degrees from 1969 to 2017, the model treats master's and PhD populations as latent compartments -- unobserved state variables that are inferred indirectly because they generate the observed completion flows -- with time-varying routing fractions and completion hazards. Using information-criterion model comparison across a grid of specifications, we find strong support for smooth nonlinear time variation in routing fractions and hazards, while models with explicit international forcing are disfavored. The preferred model achieves a log-scale root mean squared error of approximately 0.036, corresponding to a typical multiplicative error of about 4\\% in fitted degree counts, and highlights key structural shifts in the graduate pipeline: the master's pathway became increasingly central to PhD production through the late twentieth century before weakening, while direct bachelor's-to-PhD entry remained small but persistent. Estimated completion hazards for both degrees rise over time, indicating faster effective turnover in the graduate compartments. Methodologically, our main contribution is a latent stock dynamical approach that recasts linked degreecompletion time series as a coherent stock-flow system when intermediate enrollments are unobserved, making explicit both what features of pipeline dynamics are identifiable from completion data alone and what limitations such data impose."

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood. In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training."

Specifically, the DDM synthesizes highly condensed samples guided by the classifier, forcing the model to learn compacted essential class-related clues from a few incremental samples. The DCM introduces a designed loss to constrain the previously learned class distribution, which can preserve distilled knowledge more sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors."

This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. The results elucidate that the proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches."

    "abstract": "Roll-to-roll slot die coating is a widely used industrial manufacturing technique applied in a diverse range of applications such as the production of lithium-ion batteries, solar cells and optical films. The efficiency of roll-to-roll slot die coating depends on the precise control of various input parameters such as pump rate, substrate velocity and coating gap. However, these inputs are sensitive to disturbances in process conditions, leading to inconsistencies in the various characteristics of the produced film. To address this challenge, a \\gls{DO} is utilized for detecting disturbances, which may occur in the same or different channels as the control signal within the system. A generalized compensator is then implemented to mitigate the impact of these disturbances on the output, thereby enhancing uncertainty suppression. Additionally, integrating the disturbance rejection system with an output tracking controller enables the coating system to maintain the desired thickness under varying input conditions and disturbances. The effectiveness of this approach is then validated using a test rig equipped with a camera system, which facilitates the development of a data-driven model of the dynamic process, represented by state-space equations. The simulation results were demonstrated to showcase the effectiveness of the DOBOTC system, which provides a resilient solution for the output tracking issue in a data-driven model with generalized disturbances."

The interleaved clock operation between isotopes allows us to determine isotope shifts of four bosonic isotope pairs at Hz-level uncertainties, which is combined with those of other four ultra-narrow transitions in $\\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to construct the King plot. Importantly, the new isotope shift data reported in this work is a key to exclude the possibility of attributing the observed nonlinearity of the three-dimensional King plot solely to the new physics, while the previous works rely on the other terrestrial bound set by the neutron scattering and $(g-2)_e$ measurements. This work paves the way for the effective use of precision isotope shift data in the King plot analysis and stimulates further measurements in $\\mathrm{Yb}$ and other elements."

We further compare fixed strategies, such as \\texttt{l2r} and \\texttt{r2l} with adaptive ones, such as Top-$K$, finding that fixed-order decoding, including the dominating left-to-right approach, is suboptimal, while adaptive decoding yields better performance.

Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy.

Despite the $SO(3)$ isometry of $S^2$, we show that only two physical gauge fields propagate in four dimensions. The gauge kinetic matrix therefore has rank two and possesses a single zero eigenvalue. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is a direct consequence of the coset structure $S^2 \\simeq SO(3)/SO(2)$ and reflects a non-dynamical gauge direction rather than an inconsistency of the reduction.

    "abstract": "Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \\textit{reference-free} method that learns \\textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation.

    "abstract": "Let F be a finite family of graphs. In the F-Deletion problem, one is given a graph G and an integer k, and the goal is to find k vertices whose deletion results in a graph with no minor from the family F. This may be regarded as a far-reaching generalization of Vertex Cover and Feedback vertex Set. In their seminal work, Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra & Saurabh [FOCS 2012] gave a polynomial kernel for this problem when the family F contains a planar graph. As the size of their kernel is g(F) * k^{f(F)}, a natural follow-up question was whether the dependence on F in the exponent of k can be avoided. The answer turned out to be negative: Giannapoulou, Jansen, Lokshtanov & Saurabh [TALG 2017] proved that this is already inevitable for the special case of the Treewidth-d-Deletion problem. In this work, we show that this non-uniformity can be avoided at the expense of a small loss. First, we present a simple 2-approximate kernelization algorithm for Treewidth-d-Deletion with kernel size g(d) * k^5. Next, we show that the approximation factor can be made arbitrarily close to 1, if we settle for a kernelization protocol with O(1) calls to an oracle that solves instances of size bounded by a uniform polynomial in k. We also obtain linear kernels on sparse graph classes when F contains a planar graph, whereas the previously known theorems required all graphs in F to be connected. Specifically, we generalize the kernelization algorithm by Kim, Langer, Paul, Reidl, Rossmanith, Sau & Sikdar [TALG 2015] on graph classes that exclude a topological minor."

This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness."

Motivated by the primordial KaiBC system in cyanobacteria, we study a driven, finite-state molecular clock that advances through a small number of biochemical states under an intrinsic driving energy and a rotating energy landscape set by day-night metabolism. In the continuum limit, coherence is maximized at a resonant operating point where the intrinsic drift matches the driving frequency. In realistic clocks with a finite number of states, discreteness matters: as the rotating landscape sweeps over a lattice of states, it generates a small and high frequency vibration of the collective phase that makes timing inaccurate. Combining the resonant cost with this discreteness penalty yields a trade-off in the number of states: few states are energetically cheap but noisy; many states are precise but costly. The optimum lies at moderate discretization (typically five to fifteen states) and an environmental coupling that is strong enough for responsiveness yet weak enough to avoid large discrete-state vibrations. These design rules rationalize why KaiC's hexameric architecture falls near the predicted optimum and suggest a general principle for hour-glass clocks across organisms."

Our language supports the formal analysis and optimization of distributed protocols involving both qubits and photonic modes, with explicit interfaces for classical control and feedforward, all expressed within a synchronous dataflow model with discrete-time dynamics. Within this setting, we classify entangling photonic fusion measurements, show how their induced Pauli errors can be corrected via a novel flow structure for fusion networks, and establish correctness proofs for new repeat-until-success protocols enabling arbitrary fusions. Layer by layer, we construct qubit architectures incorporating practical optical components such as beam splitters, switches, and photon sources, with graphical proofs that they are deterministic and support universal quantum computation.

To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\\mathbf H\\in\\mathbb F_2^{r\\times n}$ such that $\\mathbf H\\mathbf H^\\top = \\mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes. While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible. Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach."

    "abstract": "Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity."

Yet, direct observation of rotational dynamics at the single-molecule level in liquids remains challenging due to the trade-off between optical detectability and hydrodynamic responsiveness. Labels that are bright enough for rapid readout typically introduce excessive drag, while minimally perturbing probes are difficult to detect at high speed. This limits access to fast rotational dynamics required for direct torque measurements. Here, we introduce cylindrical-polarization-based interferometric scattering microscopy (cypiSCAT), a method encoding the orientation of anisotropic scatterers directly into a single interferometric point spread function, while intrinsically suppressing the isotropic background. We achieve rotational tracking of low-drag orientation labels based on DNA origami-attached gold nanorods with sub-degree angular precision and microsecond temporal resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of nanoscale rotational dynamics. This capability provides direct access to torque metrology at the single-molecule level, here demonstrated through the extraction of optically induced torques as small as ~1 pN nm. Relying on elastic scattering, cypiSCAT combines ultrafast temporal resolution with long observation times, making it well-suited for capturing rapid and rare rotational events and reaction steps in nanoscale biomolecular systems."

    "abstract": "The problem of finding a minimal circuit to implement a given function is one of the oldest in electronics. It is known to be NP-hard. Still, many tools exist to find sub-optimal circuits to implement a function. In electronics, such tools are known as synthesisers. However, these synthesisers aim to implement very large functions (a whole electronic chip). In cryptography, the focus is on small functions, hence the necessity for new dedicated tools for small functions. Several tools exist to implement small functions. They differ by their algorithmic approach (some are based on Depth-First-Search as introduced by Ullrich in 2011, some are based on SAT-solvers like the tool desgined by Stoffelen in 2016, some non-generic tools use subfield decomposition) and by their optimisation criteria (some optimise for circuit size, others for circuit depth, and some for side-channel-protected implementations). However, these tools are limited to functions operating on less than 5 bits, sometimes 6 bits for quadratic functions, or to very simple functions. The limitation lies in a high computing time. We propose a new tool (The tool is provided alongside the IEEE article with CodeOcean and at https://github.com/seduval/implem-quad-sbox) to implement quadratic functions up to 9 bits within AND-depth 1, minimising the number of AND gates. This tool is more time-efficient than previous ones, allowing to explore larger implementations than others on 6 bits or less and allows to reach larger sizes, up to 9 bits."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a stratification framework for nonlinear semidefinite programming (NLSDP) that reveals and utilizes the geometry behind the nonsmooth KKT system. Based on the \\emph{index stratification} of $\\mathbb{S}^n$ and its lift to the primal--dual space, a stratified variational analysis is developed. Specifically, we define the stratum-restricted regularity property, characterize it by the verifiable weak second order condition (W-SOC) and weak strict Robinson constraint qualification (W-SRCQ), and interpret the W-SRCQ geometrically via transversality, which provides its genericity over ambient space and stability along strata. The interactions of these properties across neighboring strata are further examined, leading to the conclusion that classical strong-form regularity conditions correspond to the local uniform validity of stratum-restricted counterparts. On the algorithmic side, a stratified Gauss--Newton method with normal steps and a correction mechanism is proposed for globally solving the KKT equation through a least-squares merit function. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges globally to directional stationary points. Moreover, under the W-SOC and the strict Robinson constraint qualification (SRCQ), it achieves local quadratic convergence to KKT pairs and eventually identifies the active stratum."

In this work, we show with numerical simulations and seismic data analysis that large earthquake events have a tendency to follow events that are highly unequal. We have applied this framework to various tectonically active regions, such as North America, Southern Japan, parts of South-East Asia and Indonesia."

We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing\" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 < i < 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys.

The method is context-aware by design and achieves good calibration metrics globally, and within strata corresponding to different values of a selected categorical field (such as user country or device), which is often important from a business perspective of an E-commerce platform. We demonstrate the superiority of MLPlatt over existing approaches on two datasets, achieving an improvement of over 10\\% in F-ECE (Field Expected Calibration Error) compared to other methods. Most importantly, we show that high-quality calibration can be achieved without compromising the ranking quality."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent LLM systems routinely generate multiple candidate responses that are aggregated by an LLM judge. To reduce the dominant prefill cost in such pipelines, recent work advocates KV cache reuse across partially shared contexts and reports substantial speedups for generation agents. In this work, we show that these efficiency gains do not transfer uniformly to judge-centric inference. Across GSM8K, MMLU, and HumanEval, we find that reuse strategies that are effective for execution agents can severely perturb judge behavior: end-task accuracy may appear stable, yet the judge's selection becomes highly inconsistent with dense prefill. We quantify this risk using Judge Consistency Rate (JCR) and provide diagnostics showing that reuse systematically weakens cross-candidate attention, especially for later candidate blocks. Our ablation further demonstrates that explicit cross-candidate interaction is crucial for preserving dense-prefill decisions. Overall, our results identify a previously overlooked failure mode of KV cache reuse and highlight judge-centric inference as a distinct regime that demands dedicated, risk-aware system design."

Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images. However, their feature-intensive attention computation incurs high computational cost. To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates. This token-adaptive and asymmetric design enables more precise information aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard SR benchmarks demonstrate that IET achieves state-of-the-art performance under comparable computational complexity."

Respondents' ratings of the reliability of the collection of data on publication costs varied by the source of publication funding. Eighty percent of respondents rated the contribution of collecting data on publication costs to shaping the open access transformation as \"very important\" or \"important.\" Yet, these data were used as a basis for strategic decisions in only 59% of the surveyed RPOs.

    "abstract": "Selecting a few available actuators to ensure the controllability of a linear system is a fundamental problem in control theory. Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search."

The study investigates the propagation characteristics of higher-order adiabatic Lamb modes in waveguides with linearly varying thickness, with a focus on the influence of critical thicknesses on their propagation. This is achieved by leveraging the broadband excitation capabilities of a pulsed laser generating higher order Lamb modes to reveal various critical thicknesses, such as the cut-off and Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) thicknesses. Remarkably, ZGV resonances can be induced at locations well beyond the laser source. Moreover, the mode's behavior is strongly influenced by thickness variations in all directions, imparting the plate an anisotropic-like behavior. Additionally, based on the observed effects, our experimental approach enables precise reconstruction of elastic waveguide profiles in additively manufactured aluminum plates with such thickness variations. The reconstructed profiles show a strong correlation with reference measurements across the scanned area."

Provenance-graph analysis has become a prominent approach for APT detection. However, its practical deployment is hampered by (i) the scarcity of APT samples, (ii) the cost and difficulty of fine-grained APT sample labeling, and (iii) the diversity of attack tactics and techniques. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposes APT-MCL, an intelligent APT detection system based on Multi-view Collaborative provenance graph Learning. It adopts an unsupervised learning strategy to discover APT attacks at the node level via anomaly detection. After that, it creates multiple anomaly detection sub-models based on multi-view features and integrates them within a collaborative learning framework to adapt to diverse attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world APT datasets validate the approach: (i) multi-view features improve cross-scenario generalization, and (ii) co-training substantially boosts node-level detection under label scarcity, enabling practical deployment on diverse attack scenarios."

    "abstract": "The anomalous Hall effect has been understood in terms of the geometric nature of Bloch bands and impurity scattering, and has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic materials such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Recently, a large anomalous Hall effect was reported in the noncollinear antiferromagnetic metal NbMnP whose magnetic order is a mixture of the even-parity and the odd-parity magnetic components. Such a magnetic structure is expected to exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect from the symmetry breaking of the antiferromagnet ordering. Here, we theoretically investigate the intrinsic anomalous and nonlinear Hall effect of NbMnP induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch band using the first-principles calculation and the Wannier interpolation method. We found that the intrinsic Hall response of NbMnP is predominantly governed by the strongly enhanced Berry curvature and Berry-connection-polarization dipole on a specific mirror plane. These enhanced geometric quantities originate from the spin-orbit-coupling-induced gap openings along the nodal lines. Our results indicate that NbMnP serves as a model system for investigating transport phenomena originating from nodal-lines in parity-mixed antiferromagnets."

    "abstract": "Deep double descent is one of the key phenomena underlying the generalization capability of deep learning models. In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of \"deep double descent,\" \"benign overfitting,\" and \"large activation\", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent."

Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics."

The integration of nonlinear photonics with microresonators provides a compelling way for generating frequency-correlated photon pairs across discrete spectral modes. Here, by leveraging the high material nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss, we demonstrate an efficient chip-scale multi-wavelength quantum light source based on AlGaAs-on-insulator, featuring a free spectral range of approximately 200 GHz at telecom wavelengths. The optimized submicron waveguide geometry provides both high effective nonlinearity (~550 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$) and broad generation bandwidth, producing eleven distinct wavelength pairs across a 35.2 nm bandwidth with an average spectral brightness of 2.64 GHz mW$^{-2}$nm$^{-1}$. The generation of energy-time entanglement for each pair of frequency modes is verified through Franson interferometry, yielding an average net visibility of 93.1%.

Existing work in the visualization community has largely considered affordances driven by visualization design elements, such as color or chart type, but how visual design interacts with data values to impact interpretation and reasoning has remained under-explored. Dot plots and bar graphs are commonly used to help users identify groups of points that form trends and clusters, but are liable to manifest groupings that are artifacts of spatial arrangement rather than inherent patterns in the data itself. These ``Data-induced Groups'' can drive suboptimal data comparisons and potentially lead the user to incorrect conclusions. We conduct two user studies using dot plots as a case study to understand the prevalence of data-induced groupings. We find that users rely on data-induced groupings in both conditions despite the fact that trend-based groupings are irrelevant in nominal data. Based on the study results, we build a model to predict whether users are likely to perceive a given set of dot plot points as a group. We discuss two use cases illustrating how the model can assist visualization designers by both diagnosing potential user-perceived groupings in dot plots and offering redesigns that better accentuate desired groupings through data rearrangement."

Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models."

To this end, we propose a new combinatorial structure in directed acyclic graphs called the directed convex hull, which has turned out to be equivalent to their minimum localized Bayesian networks. An efficient polynomial-time algorithm is devised to identify them by determining the unique directed convex hulls containing the variables of interest from the original networks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique has high dimension reduction capability in real networks, and the efficiency of probabilistic inference based on directed convex hulls can be significantly improved compared with traditional methods such as variable elimination and belief propagation algorithms.

    "abstract": "While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types."

Operating within the emerging UAS Traffic Management (UTM) framework, these lightweight and highly networked platforms depend on secure communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) subsystems that are vulnerable to spoofing, jamming, hijacking, and data manipulation. While prior reviews of UAS security addressed these challenges at a conceptual level, a detailed, system-oriented analysis for resource-constrained sUAS remains lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of cyber-security vulnerabilities and defenses tailored to the sUAS and UTM ecosystem. We organize existing research across the full cyber-physical stack, encompassing CNS, data links, sensing and perception, UTM cloud access, and software integrity layers, and classify attack vectors according to their technical targets and operational impacts. Correspondingly, we review defense mechanisms ranging from classical encryption and authentication to adaptive intrusion detection, lightweight cryptography, and secure firmware management. By mapping threats to mitigation strategies and evaluating their scalability and practical effectiveness, this work establishes a unified taxonomy and identifies open challenges for achieving safe, secure, and scalable sUAS operations within future UTM environments."

The $w$-product outperforms existing tensor multiplication approaches by enabling fast and numerically stable tensor decompositions by proposing ``$w$-svd'' and its sparse variant ``sp-$w$-svd'', for efficient low-rank approximations with significantly reduced computational costs. Experiments on low-rank hyperspectral image reconstruction demonstrate up to a $92.21$ times speedup compared to state-of-the-art ``$t$-svd'', with comparable PSNR and SSIM metrics. We discuss the Moore-Penrose inverse of tensors based on the $w$-product and examine its essential properties. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results. Then, hyperspectral image deblurring experiments demonstrate up to $27.88$ times speedup with improved image quality. In particular, the $w$-product and the sp-$w$-product exhibit exponentially increasing acceleration with the decomposition level compared to the traditional approach of the $t$-product.

We propose \\textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging.

Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity."

    "abstract": "As one of the worldwide spread traditional game, Official International Mahjong can be played and promoted online through remote devices instead of requiring face-to-face interaction. However, online players have fragmented playtime and unfixed combination of opponents in contrary to offline players who have fixed opponents for multiple rounds of play. Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players. This work is an initial attempt to use data from AI systems to evaluate Official Internatinoal Mahjong's game balance and develop a revised version of the traditional game better adapted for online players."

    "abstract": "Recently, self-play fine-tuning (SPIN) has been proposed to adapt large language models to downstream applications with scarce expert-annotated data, by iteratively generating synthetic responses from the model itself. However, SPIN is designed to optimize the current reward advantages of annotated responses over synthetic responses at hand, which may gradually vanish during iterations, leading to unstable optimization. Moreover, the utilization of reference policy induces a misalignment issue between the reward formulation for training and the metric for generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Triplet-based Self-Play fIne-tuNing (T-SPIN) method that integrates two key designs. First, beyond current advantages, T-SPIN additionally incorporates historical advantages between iteratively generated responses and proto-synthetic responses produced by the initial policy. Even if the current advantages diminish, historical advantages remain effective, stabilizing the overall optimization. Second, T-SPIN introduces the entropy constraint into the self-play framework, which is theoretically justified to support reference-free fine-tuning, eliminating the training-generation discrepancy. Empirical results on various tasks demonstrate not only the superior performance of T-SPIN over SPIN, but also its stable evolution during iterations. Remarkably, compared to supervised fine-tuning, T-SPIN achieves comparable or even better performance with only 25% samples, highlighting its effectiveness when faced with scarce annotated data."

We conducted an online mixed-methods study with 60 participants, employing latent profile analysis to characterize personality classes and trajectory analysis to trace evolving patterns of personality adjustment. These approaches revealed distinct personality profiles at initial and final configuration stages, and adjustment trajectories, shaped by context-sensitivity. Participants also valued the autonomy, perceived the agent as more anthropomorphic, and reported greater trust. Our findings highlight the importance of designing conversational agents that adapt alongside their users, advancing more responsive and human-centred AI."

    "abstract": "Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification."

To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly.

We conducted a lab-based explanatory sequential study with university students to overcome this research gap. In the experiment, we surveyed participants about a set of general domain topics that are easy to grasp and another set of domain-specific topics that require adequate levels of chemical science knowledge to fully comprehend. We provided participants with decision-supporting information that was either produced using generative AI or collected from selected expert human-written sources to explore the role of AI-generated content compared to ordinary information during decision-making. Our result revealed that participants are less likely to change opinions on domain-specific topics. Since participants without professional knowledge had difficulty performing in-depth and independent reasoning based on the information, they favoured relying on conclusions presented in the provided materials and tended to stick to their initial opinion. Besides, information that is labelled as AI-generated is equivalently helpful as information labelled as dedicatedly human-written for participants in this experiment, indicating the vast potential as well as concerns for AI replacing human experts to help users tackle professional topics or issues."

In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \\times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines."

To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region. This offers a reliable image basis for extracting key mechanical parameters, including particle velocity, flow instability frequency, and structural vibration, thereby supporting precise quantitative analysis in extreme aerospace environments."

A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in extracting and localizing diagonal markers in complex, large-scale environments, making it ideal for field-of-view measurement in navigation tasks."

To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training.

We find an editing-preserving trade-off: harder transfers favor editing circuit heads, while easier transfers often favor near-zero (i.e., low-relevance heads) updates, preserving the source mechanism. CT-SFT also substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting, preserving proxy/source-language competence during transfer."

    "abstract": "Transformers that reuse early-layer attention projections as residuals face a fundamental tension: the first layer must simultaneously serve as a stable reference for all deeper layers and as an effective computational block. To resolve this, we propose ExoFormer, which learns dedicated exogenous anchor projections outside the sequential layer stack, decoupling the anchor role from computational refinement. Through a unified normalized mixing framework (studying different coefficient granularities: elementwise, headwise, scalar) across all attention pathways (queries, keys, values, and gate logits), ExoFormer variants consistently outperform their internal-anchor counterparts. Moreover, the dynamic variant achieves a 2.13-point increase in downstream accuracy over the baseline and demonstrates superior data efficiency, matching baseline validation loss with 1.84x fewer tokens. ExoFormer also achieves a 2x reduction in attention sink compared to standard Gated Attention. Paradoxically, all ExoFormer variants exhibit signs of representation collapse. We explain this via an Offloading Hypothesis: external anchors preserve essential token identity, allowing layers to specialize exclusively in computational refinement. We release codes and models to facilitate future research."

    "abstract": "We study the Brownian motion of a rigid rod threading through a small fixed ring while the ring can freely rotate. We derive the distribution function for the sliding displacement and the unit vector along the rod both at equilibrium and non-equilibrium. The equilibrium distribution is quadratic in the sliding displacement and is controlled by the moment of inertia (mass distribution). Applying the Onsager variational principle, we derive a Smoluchowski equation in which sliding and rotational diffusion are coupled. The mean square displacement (MSD) of sliding shows a metastable plateau in a certain time range before it approaches the final equilibrium value. The longest sliding relaxation time decreases as $α^{-1/2}$ as the moment of inertia increases. The rotational relaxation time obtained from the orientational correlation function is longer than that of a rod with its center fixed but faster than a rod with one end fixed. These results may be useful in understanding the dynamics of polymers connected by sliding rings."

    "abstract": "Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on Latin Square constraint satisfaction across 1,078 trials, pressure-field coordination matches hierarchical control (38.2% vs 38.8% aggregate solve rate, p=0.94, indicating statistical equivalence). Both significantly outperform sequential (23.3%), random (11.7%), and conversation-based multi-agent dialogue (8.6%, p<0.00001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it increases final pressure 49-fold (d=4.15). On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 87% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 2 to 32 agents. Our key finding: implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients achieves parity with explicit hierarchical control while dramatically outperforming explicit dialogue-based coordination. This suggests that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler, equally effective foundation for multi-agent AI."

    "abstract": "Contextual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) tackles the problem of solving a set of related Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) that vary across different context variables. Traditional approaches--independent training and multi-task learning--struggle with either excessive computational costs or negative transfer. A recently proposed multi-policy approach, Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), has demonstrated effectiveness by strategically selecting a few tasks to train and zero-shot transfer. However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric. These results highlight the promise of online structure detection for guiding source task selection in complex CRL environments."

We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports.

While the droplets fully wet the elastomer surface, they also simultaneously swell the elastomer film. By varying the film thickness, we observe deviations from the classical power-law scaling, which we interpret in terms of changes to the effective stiffness and the absorption potential of the system. We describe the spreading behavior using a phenomenological model that accounts for both absorption and mechanical contributions."

Unfoldable differential distributions are learned that maximize sensitivity to a parameter of interest while remaining robust against detector effects, systematic uncertainties, and biases introduced by the unfolding procedure. Detector response and systematic uncertainties are explicitly incorporated into the training through a likelihood-based loss function, enabling a direct optimization of the expected measurement precision while minimizing the bias from any assumption on the parameter of interest itself. The approach is demonstrated in an application to top quark physics, focusing on the measurement of a recently observed pseudoscalar excess at the top quark pair production threshold in dilepton final states. It is shown that a generator-level observable with enhanced sensitivity and long-term reinterpretability can be constructed using this method."

We do so by introducing a new type of diagram, called \"quantum Heegaard diagram\" (encoding the knot complement) together with a \"quantum Alexander grading\". This grading is a refinement of the Alexander grading used in knot Floer homology. Then we define a graded Lagrangian intersection, in two variables, between concrete Lagrangian submanifolds arising from the curves of the diagram in the symmetric power of the quantum Heegaard surface. The two-variable intersection unifies and recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. Moreover, this leads to knot Floer homology on one side and provides an intersection model for the Jones polynomial on the other. The surface and Lagrangian submanifolds are concretely constructed via braid actions on the punctured disc."

Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium."

However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators."

To estimate the value of an integral, i.e., the free energy, our Bayesian Umbrella Quadrature (BUQ) method iteratively selects gradient samples, i.e., bias locations, that most reduce the posterior integral variance based on a noise-tolerant Gaussian process model, which also effectively interpolates between samples. We validate the method for a conformational change in a small peptide, a water-to-ice phase transition, and a substitution chemical reaction; obtaining excellent accuracies and speedups.

To address this gap, we introduce Attributional NLI (Att-NLI), a framework that extends NLI with principles from social psychology to assess an agent's capacity for abductive intentional inference (generating hypotheses about latent intentions), and subsequent deductive verification (drawing valid logical conclusions). We instantiate Att-NLI via a textual game, Undercover-V, experimenting with three types of LLM agents with varying reasoning capabilities and access to external tools: a standard NLI agent using only deductive inference, an Att-NLI agent employing abductive-deductive inference, and a neuro-symbolic Att-NLI agent performing abductive-deductive inference with external theorem provers. Extensive experiments demonstrate a clear hierarchy of attributional inference capabilities, with neuro-symbolic agents consistently outperforming others, achieving an average win rate of 17.08%. Our results underscore the role that Att-NLI can play in developing agents with sophisticated reasoning capabilities, highlighting, at the same time, the potential impact of neuro-symbolic AI in building rational LLM agents acting in multi-agent environments."

The nearly isotropic magnets enable low-current dynamical stabilisation of the magnetisation in the direction opposite to an applied magnetic field, thereby realising a spintronic analogue of the Kapitza pendulum. In an intermediate current regime, the STT drives large magnetisation vector fluctuations that cover the entire Bloch sphere. The continuous variable associated with the stochastic magnetisation direction may serve as a resource for probabilistic computing and neuromorphic hardware.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a central optimisation framework in machine learning. Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems."

In real-world applications, particularly in the energy sector, decision variables can be expressed as physical quantities (e.g., production volumes), and nonlinear performance metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) may be requested. These modeling choices introduce challenges, including the non-additivity of the objective function. This often results in highly concentrated optimized portfolios and thus limited diversification, which can be problematic for decision-makers seeking balanced investment strategies. This paper proposes two strategies to enhance diversification in ROI-based PO models, both based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The first incorporates an HHI term directly into the objective function, with its corresponding weight allowing control over diversification. The second directly maximizes diversification while controlling expected profit and risk degradation around the optimum portfolio (obtained through conventional PO). Both strategies are evaluated using synthetic data (energy assets) to illustrate their behavior and practical trade-offs. The results highlight how each method can support different decision-making needs and enhance portfolio robustness."

Here we report a handheld-scale, single-beam scalar $^{87}$Rb OPAM with a sensor-head volume of approximately 110 mL. The device operates in an all-optical Bell-Bloom configuration and uses digital lock-in, dispersive tracking of the $^{87}$Rb Larmor resonance, implemented with a hybrid electronics stack that combines in-house control hardware with commercial modules. A single frequency-modulated laser beam performs both pumping and probing without RF coils. In an unshielded indoor environment, the magnetometer exhibits a noise floor below 6 pT/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ near 80 Hz and a measurement bandwidth of 200 Hz. In an unshielded Earth-field deployment, we detect repeatable transient magnetic signatures from a controlled elevator motion sequence and quantify standoff observability over sensor-elevator distances from 1.25 m to 10 m. These results show that compact scalar OPAMs can provide bandwidth and range-resolved event sensitivity suitable for field-deployable magnetic anomaly detection and infrastructure monitoring in realistic geomagnetic environments."

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is concerned with producing explanations indicating the inner workings of models. For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper \"Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth\", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method \"AXE\" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions."

Two novel continuous-time dynamical systems are proposed to analyze the finite-time and fixed-time stability of solutions to GIMVIPs in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Under suitable assumptions on the operators and model parameters, Lyapunov-based techniques are employed to establish finite-time and fixed-time convergence of the generated trajectories. While both systems exhibit accelerated convergence, the settling time of the finite-time stable system depends on the initial condition, whereas the fixed-time stable system admits a uniform upper bound on the convergence time that is independent of the initial state. Moreover, an explicit forward Euler discretization of the continuous-time dynamics leads to a proximal point-type algorithm that preserves the fixed-time convergence property. Rigorous convergence analysis of the resulting iterative scheme is provided. A numerical experiment is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

We optimized this structure using a genetic algorithm and demonstrated its robustness against geometric imperfections and oblique incidence. Experimental reflection spectra measured under normal incidence in a circular polarization basis demonstrate a more than 100-nm-wide reflection band in which more than 98% of the reflected light preserves its handedness. The total reflection coefficient reached 80%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fabricated mirror maintains high performance even under oblique incidence for angles up to $\\pm 15^\\circ$. Owing to these unique characteristics, this mirror can serve as a reflective phase plate, making it an excellent candidate for the creation of a Fabry-Pérot resonator for chiral light."

Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models. Notably, code-specialized models excel in zero-shot and few-shot settings on complex tasks, while general-purpose models remain nearly as effective. Discrepancies among CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore, BLEU, and ChrF highlight the inadequacy of current metrics for measuring repair quality. Conclusions: This study contributes to the software security community by investigating the potential of advanced LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis and remediation."

To alleviate this problem, we propose PersonaDual, a framework that supports both general-purpose objective reasoning and personalized reasoning in a single model, and adaptively switches modes based on context. PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection.

By construction, it forms almost surely a tree rooted at $0$. The RST was introduced in 2007 by Baccelli and Bordenave, who investigated straightness, a deterministic property introduced by Howard and Newman in 2001, to derive information about the asymptotic directions of infinite branches. They proved that the RST is almost surely straight in dimension $2$, which directly implies that all infinite branches are asymptotically directed, every possibility is attained, and directions reached by multiple infinite branches form a dense subset. However, their approach relies crucially on planarity, preventing any straightforward extension to higher dimensions. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the RST is almost surely \\emph{straight} in any dimension, thereby obtaining the same consequences for the behavior of infinite branches. Our approach resolves the key barriers in the study of the RST, notably those posed by the complex dependency structure combined with the radial nature of the model, and especially beyond the planar setting. It relies on tools developed for the analysis of the Directed Spanning Forest, a closely related model, including recent progress by the author in 2025. Specifically, a key contribution of this work is the construction of a suitable renewal-type decomposition of RST paths. Leveraging this decomposition together with classical concentration inequalities, we show that RST paths cannot deviate far from straight lines and derive straightness."

    "abstract": "In arXiv:2211.09069, significant progress was made in decomposing simple products of fermion correlation functions, and in summing over spin structures of superstring amplitudes in genus two under cyclic constraints. In this manuscript we consider part of the same subject using a framework in which one of the branch points of the genus two curve is fixed at infinity. This framework is a direct generalization of the popular one in the case of genus one. We address some of the issues that remained unresolved in our previous paper arXiv:2209.14633. We show that the spin structures of the simple products of fermion correlation functions with cyclic conditions depend only on the Pe-function values at the half-periods of the genus two surface, for any number of factors in the products. Similar to the genus one case, we can provide basis functions to decompose the product. Consequently, the trilinear relations found in arXiv:2211.09069 can be derived from the known set of differential equations of genus two Pe-functions by simply setting the variables equal to the half-periods of the non-singular and even spin structures, as is the case for genus one. The focus of this manuscript is on the procedures for expressing the results of decomposed formulae in terms of the unique genus two theta function. At present we cannot provide a procedure for deriving the general form of the decomposed formula totally expressed in terms of the theta functions for an arbitrary number of the fermion correlation functions in the product, by the reason described in the text. We present some general results and demonstrate that concrete expressions of both the spin structure dependent and independent parts will be derived and simplified to analyze using the logic of the derivations of the classical solutions to Jacobi inversion problem and their modifications which will be given in this manuscript."

The key strength of the proposed system is the automatic personalization of the virtual environment, based on both the individual's abilities and their specific training needs.

While margins and robust optimization mitigate these effects, they provide only implicit control over clinical goal fulfillment probability. We therefore develop a probabilistic planning framework using a percentile-based optimization function that targets a specified probability of clinical goal fulfillment. Systematic and random uncertainties were explicitly modeled over full treatment courses. A scenario dose approximation method based on interpolation between a fixed set of doses was used, enabling efficient simulation of treatment courses during optimization. The framework was evaluated on a prostate case treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and a brain case treated with pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy. Plans were compared to conventional margin-based and worst-case robust optimization using probabilistic evaluation. For the prostate case, probabilistic optimization improved organ at risk (OAR) sparing while maintaining target coverage compared to margin-based planning, increasing average OAR goal fulfillment probability by 13.3 percentage points and reducing 90th percentile OAR doses by an average of 3.5~Gy. For the brain case, probabilistic optimization improved target minimum dose passing probabilities (e.g., 88\\% vs.~22\\% for $D_{95}$) and brainstem maximum dose passing probability (70\\% vs.~30\\%), while maintaining comparable or improved OAR sparing compared to worst-case optimization. Probabilistic optimization enables explicit and interpretable control over goal fulfillment probabilities. Combining full treatment course modeling with efficient approximate dose calculation, the proposed framework improved the trade-off between target coverage and OAR sparing compared to conventional planning approaches in both photon and proton therapy."

    "abstract": "Multiple binary responses arise in many modern data-analytic problems. Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition. Exploiting the fact that the pairwise loss depends only on differences of linear predictors, we simplify computation and analysis. We establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, showing that under suitable regularity conditions, leading to linear convergence up to the minimax-optimal statistical precision. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in challenging settings such as label switching and data contamination and consistently outperforms likelihood-based approaches."

Our assumption is closely related to the notion of separate exchangeability studied in earlier work, but can be more realistic in many economic settings as it imposes minimal restrictions on the covariate distribution. We construct permutation tests of significance that are valid in finite samples and establish theoretical power guarantees, in contrast to existing methods that are justified only asymptotically.

    "abstract": "Dynamical systems are essential to model various phenomena in physics, finance, economics, and are also of current interest in machine learning. A central modeling task is investigating parameter sensitivity, whether tuning atmospheric coefficients, computing financial Greeks, or optimizing neural networks. These sensitivities are mathematically expressed as derivatives of an objective function with respect to parameters of interest and are rarely available analytically, necessitating numerical methods for approximating them. While the literature for differentiation of deterministic systems is well-covered, the treatment of stochastic systems, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in most curricula is less comprehensive than the subtleties arising from the interplay of noise and discretization require. This paper provides a primer on numerical differentiation of SDEs organized as a two-tale narrative. Tale 1 demonstrates differentiating through discretized SDEs, known the discretize-optimize approach, is reliable for both Itô and Stratonovich calculus. Tale 2 examines the optimize-discretize approach, investigating the continuous limit of backward equations from Tale 1 corresponding to the desired gradients. Our aim is to equip readers with a clear guide on the numerical differentiation of SDEs: computing gradients correctly in both Itô and Stratonovich settings, understanding when discretize-optimize and optimize-discretize agree or diverge, and developing intuition for reasoning about stochastic differentiation beyond the cases explicitly covered."

We also show that an optimal measurement, maximizing a concurrence-type entanglement measure, is built from complex Hadamard matrices. For this optimal protocol, we provide a complete, dimension-dependent classification of deterministic entanglement-swapping measurements: unique in dimensions $d=2,3$, infinite for $d=4$, and comprising $72$ inequivalent classes for $d=5$. We further consider a general network with multiple swapping nodes and show that, for $d=2,3$ the resulting end-to-end state is independent of the order in which the repeaters perform the optimal measurements. Our results establish optimal entanglement-swapping schemes that are post-selection free, in the sense that they distribute entanglement across generic quantum network architectures without unfavorable measurement outcomes."

    "abstract": "Although the principle of superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is the root of almost all quantum phenomena such as coherence and entanglement, its quantification, except for that related to the resource theory of coherence and interference, remains relatively less studied. In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states. We investigate the minimum and maximum superpositions, reveal their basic properties, and illustrate them through various examples. We further explore the dynamics of superposition in the Grover search algorithm, and demonstrate a complementary relation between superposition and success probability of the search algorithm. These results and quantifiers offer tools for analyzing structural features and implications of quantum superposition."

    "abstract": "Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems."

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid beta proteins is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, and is usually accompanied by cerebrovascular pathology. Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the \"two-hit vascular hypothesis\" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak."

Here we examine the extinction curve for the line of sight toward HD 93222, a young star located in the Carina nebula. It is found that the 2175 Angstrom bump is extremely sharp, which is among the narrowest ever found in the Milky Way and external galaxies.

    "abstract": "Since its introduction as a Maker-Breaker positional game by Duchêne et al. in 2020, the Maker-Breaker domination game has become one of the most studied positional games on vertices. In this game, two players, Dominator and Staller, alternately claim an unclaimed vertex of a given graph G. If at some point the set of vertices claimed by Dominator is a dominating set, she wins; otherwise, i.e. if Staller manages to isolate a vertex by claiming all its closed neighborhood, Staller wins. Given a graph G and a first player, Dominator or Staller must have a winning strategy. We are interested in the computational complexity of determining which player has such a strategy. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on bipartite graphs of bounded degree and split graphs; polynomial on cographs, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs; and in NP for interval graphs. In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of this game. We start by considering as a parameter the number of moves of both players. We prove that for the general framework of Maker-Breaker positional games in hypergraphs, determining whether Breaker can claim a transversal of the hypergraph in k moves is W[2]-complete, in contrast to the problem of determining whether Maker can claim all the vertices of a hyperedge in k moves, which is known to be W[1]-complete since 2017. These two hardness results are then applied to the Maker-Breaker domination game, proving that it is W[2]-complete to decide if Dominator can dominate the graph in k moves and W[1]-complete to decide if Staller can isolate a vertex in k moves. Next, we provide FPT algorithms for the Maker-Breaker domination game parameterized by the neighborhood diversity, the modular width, the P4-fewness, the distance to cluster, and the feedback edge number."

This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts. The study demonstrates the potential of this AI assistant to support informed, timely decision-making and strengthen water security in complex river basins."

    "abstract": "Systemic risk refers to the overall vulnerability arising from the high degree of interconnectedness and interdependence within the financial system. In the rapidly developing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, numerous studies have analyzed systemic risk through specific channels such as liquidity pressures, leverage mechanisms, smart contract risks, and historical risk events. However, these studies are mostly event-driven or focused on isolated risk channels, paying limited attention to the structural dimension of systemic risk. Overall, this study provides a unified quantitative framework for ecosystem-level analysis and continuous monitoring of systemic risk in DeFi. From a network-based perspective, this paper proposes the DeFi Correlation Fragility Indicator (CFI), constructed from time-varying correlation networks at the protocol category level. The CFI captures ecosystem-wide structural fragility associated with correlation concentration and increasing synchronicity. Furthermore, we define a Risk Contribution Score (RCS) to quantify the marginal contribution of different protocol types to overall systemic risk. By combining the CFI and RCS, the framework enables both the tracking of time-varying systemic risk and identification of structurally important functional modules in risk accumulation and amplification."

    "abstract": "Sweepstakes reproduction refers to a highly skewed individual recruitment success without involving natural selection and may apply to individuals in broadcast spawning populations characterised by Type III survivorship. We consider an extension of the model of sweepstakes reproduction for a haploid panmictic population of constant size $N$; the extension also works as an alternative to the Wright-Fisher model. Our model incorporates an upper bound on the random number of potential offspring (juveniles) produced by a given individual. Depending on how the bound behaves relative to the total population size, we obtain the Kingman coalescent, an incomplete Beta-coalescent, or the (complete) Beta-coalescent. We argue that applying such an upper bound is biologically reasonable. Moreover, we estimate the error of the coalescent approximation. The error estimates reveal that convergence can be slow, and small sample size can be sufficient to invalidate convergence, for example if the stated bound is of the form $N/\\log N$. We use simulations to investigate the effect of increasing sample size on the site-frequency spectrum. When the limit is a Beta-coalescent, the site frequency spectrum will be as predicted by the limiting tree even though the full coalescent tree may deviate from the limiting one. When in the domain of attraction of the Kingman coalescent the effect of increasing sample size depends on the effective population size as has been noted in the case of the Wright-Fisher model. Conditioning on the population ancestry (the random ancestral relations of the entire population at all times) may have little effect on the site-frequency spectrum for the models considered here (as evidenced by simulation results)."

SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates. Empirical results demonstrate that SVFusion achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput, exhibiting a 20.9x higher throughput on average and 1.3x to 50.7x lower latency compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high recall for large-scale datasets under various streaming workloads."

Algorithms of this form have been designed and used for solving various computational problems, in different contexts, including effective closure properties for linear differential or recurrence equations, the computation of a differential equation satisfied by an algebraic function, and many others. We propose a unified approach for establishing precise degree bounds on the solutions of all these problems.

    "abstract": "Binary evolution plays a central role in producing rapidly rotating stars. Previous studies have shown that mass gainers in binaries can reach critical rotation after accreting only modest amounts of material, particularly during thermal-timescale Case B mass transfer, where tidal spin-down is ineffective due to wide orbits. However, such rapid accretion often drives the mass gainer out of thermal equilibrium, and its subsequent spin evolution during thermal relaxation has not been analysed in depth. In this study, we construct a suite of accreting detailed single-star models with different accretion prescriptions, which inflate and spin up to critical rotation during the accretion. After the accretion has ended, the models relax thermally and deflate. We find that the ratio of surface to critical angular velocity decreases to subcritical values during thermal contraction, with the magnitude of this decrease correlating with the degree of thermal disequilibrium at the end of accretion. This reduction in fractional critical rotation is even stronger when internal angular momentum transport is inefficient. Detailed binary models show the same trend, indicating that the results from our toy single-star models also apply to real binary evolution. Our results highlight that binary mass transfer does not always produce critically rotating stars, but instead may yield a wide range of spin rates depending on the mass transfer and accretion history. Our findings offer new insights into the rotational properties of mass gainers in binaries, stellar merger products, and newly formed massive stars following accretion."

The method estimates the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal to recover both the signal intensity and the Doppler shift. The received signal power is estimated at 1-sec cadence which enhances the sensitivity and detection of the signal at lower altitudes of Venus, even in regions of high atmospheric opacity. After correcting total attenuation for refractive losses, absorption by known microwave absorbers is removed, leaving a residual signal attributable to sulfuric acid vapor. Two different methods of estimating the absorption due to Sulfur Dioxide have been presented, including one which incorporates in-situ data, which should better constrain the sulfuric acid vapor abundance below the clouds. Retrieved profiles for altitudes of 40 - 50 km reveal an increasing vapor abundance to more than 10 ppm below the clouds, and a sharp decline above 50 km in line with the expected saturation profile. These measurements agree with current models of the Venusian cloud structure and composition, and demonstrate that RO data, when coupled with optimized spectral analysis, can yield quantitative constraints on trace absorbers in optically thick atmospheres."

However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Anomalous sound detection (ASD) typically involves self-supervised proxy tasks to learn feature representations from normal sound data, owing to the scarcity of anomalous samples. In ASD research, proxy tasks such as AutoEncoders operate under the explicit assumption that models trained on normal data will increase the reconstruction errors related to anomalies. A natural extension suggests that improved proxy task performance should improve ASD capability; however, this relationship has received little systematic attention. This study addresses this research gap by quantitatively analyzing the relationship between proxy task metrics and ASD performance across five configurations, namely, AutoEncoders, classification, source separation, contrastive learning, and pre-trained models. We evaluate the learned representations using linear probe (linear separability) and Mahalanobis distance (distributional compactness). Our experiments reveal that strong proxy performance does not necessarily improve anomalous sound detection performance. Specifically, classification tasks experience performance saturation owing to insufficient task difficulty, whereas contrastive learning fails to learn meaningful features owing to limited data diversity. Notably, source separation is the only task demonstrating a strong positive correlation, such that improved separation consistently improves anomaly detection. Based on these findings, we highlight the critical importance of task difficulty and objective alignment. Finally, we propose a three-stage alignment verification protocol to guide the design of highly effective proxy tasks for ASD systems."

This paper introduces MinGLE (Mini Geant4 Learning Example), a dedicated application template designed to be a universal, flexible, and educational starting point for Geant4 projects. MinGLE achieves a complete, functional simulation kernel using fewer than 70 lines of core C++ code. This minimalism is realized by leveraging contemporary Geant4 features, including factory classes for run management and physics, and the Text Geometry format for detector definition. Furthermore, MinGLE employs a unique pedagogical structure, using Git tags to document the incremental development of eleven core Geant4 components, with each tagged version being fully compilable, executable, and testable, providing a clear, step-by-step learning resource."

By establishing an explicit correspondence with the ratio of contiguous Gaussian hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b; c; z), we show that these identities can be derived via a discrete sequence of equivalence transformations. We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel. Stability analysis confirms that the resulting limit-periodic structures reside strictly within the Worpitzky convergence disk, ensuring absolute convergence. This work demonstrates that such algorithmically discovered identities are not isolated numerical artifacts, but are deeply rooted in the classical theory of hypergeometric transformations."

    "abstract": "The advantage of RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) detection lies in its ability to perform modality fusion and integrate cross-modality complementary information, enabling robust detection under diverse illumination and weather conditions. However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation. This design effectively excludes the degraded modality and corrects the predictions using high-quality queries. Moreover, the decoupled framework allows us to optimize each individual branch with unpaired RGB or TIR images, eliminating the need for paired RGB-T data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers superior performance to existing RGB-T detectors and achieves better modality independence."

To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors."

    "abstract": "In the era of digital animation, the quest to produce lifelike facial animations for virtual characters has led to the development of various retargeting methods. While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion."

However, this success heavily relies on expensive external verifiers or human rules. Such dependency not only leads to significant computational costs and training latency, but also yields sparse rewards that hinder optimization efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Latent-GRPO, a framework that derives intrinsic rewards directly from latent space geometry. Crucially, our empirical analysis reveals a compelling geometric property: terminal token representations of correct reasoning trajectories form dense clusters with high intra-class similarity, whereas incorrect trajectories remain scattered as outliers. In light of this discovery, we introduce the Iterative Robust Centroid Estimation (IRCE) algorithm, which generates dense, continuous rewards by mitigating magnitude fluctuations via spherical projection and estimating a robust ``truth centroid'' through iterative aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method maintains model performance while achieving a training speedup of over 2x compared to baselines. Furthermore, extensive results demonstrate strong generalization ability and robustness. The code will be released soon."

They are grown by plasma-activated molecular beam epitaxy, varying either the nominal thickness or the gallium-to-nitrogen flux ratio. In situ monitoring reveals difference in 2D nucleation and step-flow growth modes of the QWs. The emission charactestics of QWs with integer thicknesses of 1 and 2 MLs depend weakly on the growth mechanism. In contrast, the intensity and spectral position luminescence of QWs with fractional-ML thicknesses are determined by the growth mechanism. Using ab initio calculations, a phenomenological model is proposed that describes fractional-ML QWs either as arrays of 2D quantum disks or as arrays of 2D quantum ribbons, in cases where 2D nucleation or step-flow growth mechanisms predominate, respectively. This model is generally consistent with experimental data on photo- and cathodoluminescence of heterostructures with multiple (250) GaN/AlN QWs. These heterostructures, when pumped by electrom beam at an energy 12.5 keV with a maximum pulse current of 2 A, exhibit linear current dependences of optical peak powers up to 1 and 37 W for wavelengths of 228 and 256 nm, respectively, making them promising for use as powerfull ultraviolet-C emitters."

    "abstract": "The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks."

These configurations span a range of field period numbers and other geometric control parameters, including the magnetic axis shape and plasma elongation. To evaluate each configuration, we use a broad set of measures, including effective ripple, sensitivity of the Shafranov shift to changes in plasma beta, the prevalence of maximum-J trapped particles, and the Rosenbluth-Hinton residual, among others. This enables an exhaustive, thorough and quantitative characterization of the database. Statistical analysis and modern machine learning techniques are then employed to find correlations, and identify key descriptors and heuristics to help understand tendencies that govern the behaviour of numerical optimization. The database provides baseline configurations for further studies, and to serve as tailored initial conditions for optimization. With this work we initiate a long term program to complete a systematic exploration of quasi-isodynamic stellarator design space."

Future higher contrast systems, like the Extremely Large Telescope's Planetary Camera System, will require higher performance wavefront sensing. A further performance improvement could be achieved with a polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor by using additional information over a broader wavelength range. The development of such systems is becoming more feasible with the emergence of new detector technologies such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. These are arrays of superconductor detectors that give a position, arrival time and measure of the energy for each incident photon. This paper introduces the polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor concept by defining the technologies and techniques employed and their requirements. A method is developed to track the optical gains, taking advantage of the additional wavelength information, and used to compensate for optical gains within an optimised reconstructor to minimise noise propagation. An overview of expected performance improvement, using end-to-end simulations, is provided using the Keck II adaptive optics system as a reference design. The polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor was shown to increase the limiting magnitude by 1 to 2 magnitudes, and the contrast by factors of 1.5 to 4, versus single band pyramid wavefront sensors, by sensing over a wavelength range approximately five to ten times broader (800-1800 nm) compared to Z band (152 nm wide) and H band (300 nm wide).

    "abstract": "Creativity in artificial intelligence is most often addressed through evaluative frameworks that aim to measure novelty, diversity, or usefulness in generated outputs. While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of chemical species and reaction pathways from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories is a prerequisite for deriving predictive chemical-kinetic models and for mechanistic discovery in reactive systems. However, state-of-the-art trajectory analysis methods infer bonding from instantaneous distance thresholds, which can misclassify transient, nonreactive encounters as bonds and thereby introduce spurious intermediates, distorted reaction networks, and biased rate estimates. Here, we introduce ChemXDyn, a dynamics-aware computational methodology that leverages time-resolved interatomic distance signatures as a core principle to robustly identify chemically consistent bonded interactions and, consequently, extract meaningful reaction pathways. In particular, ChemXDyn propagates molecular connectivity through time while enforcing atomic valence and coordination constraints to distinguish genuine bond-breaking and bond-forming events from transient, nonreactive encounters. We evaluate ChemXDyn on ReaxFF MD simulations of hydrogen and ammonia oxidation and on neural-network potential MD simulations of methane oxidation, and benchmark its performance against widely used trajectory analysis methods. Across these cases, ChemXDyn suppresses unphysical species prevalent in static analyses, recovers experimentally consistent reaction pathways, and improves the fidelity of rate constant estimation. In ammonia oxidation, ChemXDyn removes unphysical intermediates and resolves key NOx- and N2O-forming and -consuming routes. In methane oxidation, it reconstructs the canonical progression from CH4 to CO2. By linking atomistic dynamics to chemically consistent reaction identification, ChemXDyn provides a transferable foundation for MD-derived reaction networks and kinetics, with potential utility spanning combustion, catalysis, plasma chemistry, and electrochemical environments."

To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability."

    "abstract": "When we consider canonical averages for classical discrete systems, typically referred to as substitutional alloys, the map from many-body interatomic interactions to thermodynamic equilibrium configurations generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. This canonical nonlinearity is fundamentally rooted in deviations of the discrete configurational density of states (CDOS) from continuous Gaussian families, and has conventionally been characterized by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence on discrete statistical manifold. Thus, the previous works inevitablly missed intrinsic nonlinearities induced by discretization of Gaussian families, which remains invisible within conventional information-geometric descriptions. In the present work, we identify and quantify such unavoidable canonical nonlinearity by employing the 2-Wasserstein distance with a cost function aligned with the Fisher metric for Gaussian families. We derive an explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance in the limit of vanishing discretization scale d to 0: W2 = d*sqrt(Tr(Gamma)^(-1)/12), where Gamma denotes covariance matrix of the CDOS. We further show that this limiting Wasserstein distance admits a clear geometric interpretation on the statistical manifold, equivalent to a KL divergence associated with the expected parallel translations of continuous Gaussian. Our framework thus provides a transport-information-geometric characterization of discretization-induced nonlinearity in classical discrete systems, with future potential applications to configurational thermodynamics."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous driving and embodied AI systems, where reliable perception is critical for safe semantic reasoning and decision-making. While recent VLMs demonstrate strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications."

RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated."

    "abstract": "Modeling rainfall intensity distributions across aggregation scales (from sub-hourly to weekly) is essential for hydrological risk analysis and IDF curves. Aggregation naturally imposes mathematical constraints: return levels must be ordered by time scale, as daily accumulations necessarily exceed sub-daily ones. From a statistical perspective, each aggregation step should ideally not require additional parameters, yet parsimonious models describing the full distribution remain scarce, as most literature focuses on seasonal block maxima. In this study, we propose a parsimonious framework to model all rainfall intensities (low to large) across scales. We utilize the Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (EGPD), which aligns with extreme value theory for both tails while remaining flexible for the bulk of the distribution. We establish a general result on the behavior of EGPD variables under various aggregation procedures. To overcome the difficulty of direct likelihood inference, we link the EGPD class to Poisson compound sums. This allows the use of the Panjer algorithm for efficient composite likelihood evaluation. Our approach ensures that return levels do not cross across scales and enables estimation for return periods below annual or seasonal levels. We demonstrate the method using sub-hourly series from six French stations with diverse climates. Only eight parameters are needed per station to capture scales from six minutes to three days. IDF curves above and below the annual scale are provided."

    "abstract": "The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits how isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, assuming that individual eigenstates at the same energy density have identical expectation values of local observables in the limit of large systems. While the ETH apparently holds across a wide range of interacting quantum systems, in this work we show that it requires generalization in the presence of thermal first-order phase transitions. We introduce a class of all-to-all spin models, featuring first-order thermal phase transitions that stem from two distinct mean-field solutions (two ``branches'') that exchange dominance in the many-body density of states as the energy is varied. We argue that for energies in the vicinity of the thermal phase transition, eigenstate expectation values do not need to converge to the same thermal value. The system has a regime with coexistence of two classes of eigenstates corresponding to the two branches with distinct expectation values at the same energy density, and another regime with Schrodinger-cat-like eigenstates that are inter-branch superpositions; these two regimes are separated by an eigenstate phase transition. We support our results by semiclassical calculations and an exact diagonalization study of a microscopic spin model, and argue that the structure of eigenstates in the vicinity of thermal first-order phase transitions can be experimentally probed via non-equilibrium dynamics."

Methods. Amongst the longest light curves ever studied for these sources, we investigated 20 years of data (2005-2025) from the Swift-UVOT and Swift-XRT telescopes. We examined spectral models, fractional variabilities, flux distributions, and X-ray photon index vs flux relations, as well as carrying out in-depth time series analysis using structure functions, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and discrete correlation functions. Results. Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 both showed intriguing variability in all studied wavelengths; this variability has been found to be energy dependent, as has the trend of lognormality in flux distributions. X-ray photon indices fluctuated greatly throughout the entire period, showing an overall harder-when-brighter trend. Hints of a quasi-periodicity have been found in the X-ray of Mrk 501 (host frame time scale $\\sim390$ days, >3$σ$) but not in the UV or X-ray of Mrk 421, or in the UV of Mrk 501.

We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level."

By analyzing the nearest-neighbor level spacings, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and the scaling behavior of the integrated density of states (IDS), we demonstrate how the self-similar geometry of the potential is imprinted on the quantum spectrum. The energy-resolved level spacings form a hierarchical, filamentary structure, in sharp contrast to those of periodic and random systems. The normalized level-spacing distribution exhibits a bimodal structure, reflecting the deterministic recurrence of spectral gaps. A multifractal analysis of eigenstates reveals critical behavior: the generalized fractal dimensions $D_q$ lie strictly between the limits of extended and localized states, exhibiting a distinct $q$-dependence. Consistently, the IPR indicates the coexistence of quasi-extended and localized features, characteristic of critical wave functions. The IDS shows anomalous power-law scaling at low energies, with an exponent close to the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying Cantor set, indicating that the geometric fractality governs the spectral dimensionality. At higher energies, this scaling crosses over to the semiclassical Weyl law. Our results establish a direct connection between deterministic fractal geometry, hierarchical spectral statistics, and quantum criticality."

Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

    "abstract": "Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations."

We find that at lower orders, EFT predicts correlations between the different partial wave coefficients. This allows us to construct linear combinations of partial wave coefficients that get their leading contributions from a higher dimension EFT operator. We then introduce experimental observables, the so called angular moments -- that probe these linear combinations of partial wave coefficients -- and can be determined from a fully differential analysis of the angular distribution of the leptons arising from the $Z$ decay. We show that analysing the dependence of these angular moments on the $Zh$ invariant mass allows us to systematically probe all higher dimension EFT operators contributing to this process. While we take the Higgs-strahlung process as an example, the methods developed here are completely general and can be applied to other 2-to-2 collider processes."

The coexistence of these two amplitudes is essential for generating nonzero CP violation (CPV) effects. Since the $λ_b$ amplitude is strongly suppressed, its experimental determination is highly challenging. However, by exploiting SU(3) flavor symmetry, which relates the well-measured Cabibbo-favored (CF) amplitudes to the SCS tree amplitudes, information on the $λ_b$ amplitude can be extracted.Using current experimental data, a conservative analysis yields $λ_b$ amplitudes can be as large as about $10\\%$ of the corresponding tree amplitudes with a significance of $2.1σ$. In addition, the Lee-Yang parameters of these decays provide an independent probe of this elusive term. We further identify two golden decay channels, $Ξ_c^0 \\to p K^-$ and $Ξ_c^0 \\to Σ^+ π^-$, which are particularly well suited for experimental studies of CPV."

Yet, existing datasets and data-generation approaches are limited by static, predefined toolsets that cannot scale to the complexity of open-ended human-agent collaboration. To address this, we initially developed a framework for automated task-oriented multi-turn dialogue generation at scale, utilizing an LRM-based simulator to dynamically generate high-value, domain-specific tools to solve specified tasks. However, we observe that a purely task-oriented design often results in \"solely task-solving\" trajectories, where the agent completes the objective with minimal interaction, failing to generate the high turn-count conversations seen in realistic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we shift toward a user-oriented simulation paradigm. By decoupling task generation from a dedicated user simulator that mimics human behavioral rules - such as incremental request-making and turn-by-turn feedback - we facilitate more authentic, extended multi-turn dialogues that reflect the iterative nature of real-world problem solving. Our generation pipeline operates as a versatile, plug-and-play module capable of initiating generation from any state, ensuring high scalability in producing extended tool-use data. Furthermore, by facilitating multiple task completions within a single trajectory, it yields a high-density dataset that reflects the multifaceted demands of real-world human-agent interaction."

We compared X-ray observations from all-sky surveys like eROSITA, plus archival observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, survey radio observations from ASKAP's Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey plus archival VLA observations, in conjunction with new cluster catalogs with Gaia. From X-ray, we found 77 X-ray sources likely associated with IC 2602, 31 X-ray sources in NGC 2632, and 31 near M67's central regions. We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson & Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters."

Although pretrained atomistic models achieve strong in-distribution accuracy after fine-tuning, their reliability under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains unclear. We identify a critical failure mode in downstream adaptation: standard fine-tuning induces representation collapse, erasing pretrained chemical and structural priors and severely degrading OOD performance. To address this limitation, we propose multi-task fine-tuning (MFT), which jointly optimizes downstream property prediction with a physically grounded force-field objective inherited from pretraining. This approach preserves essential chemical priors while enabling task-specific adaptation. Across molecular and materials benchmarks, MFT consistently improves OOD generalization, approaching the theoretical limit set by in-distribution accuracy, while outperforming standard fine-tuning, training from scratch, and state-of-the-art task-specific models. These results establish safe adaptation as a central requirement for large atomistic models and position MFT as a practical and data-efficient pathway toward robust molecular and materials discovery."

    "abstract": "Bell measurements (BMs) are ubiquitous in quantum information and technology. They are basic elements for quantum commmunication, computation, and error correction. In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ideal setting without photon loss, BMs cannot be done perfectly based on the simplest experimental toolbox of linear optics. Here we demonstrate that any logical BM on stabilizer codes can always be mapped onto a single physical BM perfomed on any qubit pair from the two codes. As a necessary condition for the success of a logical BM, this provides a general upper bound on its success probability, especially ruling out the possibility that the stabilizer information obtainable from only partially succeeding, physical linear-optics BMs could be combined into the full logical stabilizer information. We formulate sufficient criteria to find schemes for which a single successful BM on the physical level will always allow to obtain the full logical information by suitably adapting the subsequent physical measurements. Our approach based on stabilizer group theory is generally applicable to any stabilizer code, which we demonstrate for quantum parity, five-qubit, standard and rotated planar surface, tree, and seven-qubit Steane codes. Our schemes attain the general upper bound for all these codes, while this bound had previously only been reached for the quantum parity code."

This paper sets up the foundations of our study. We introduce and study various classes of $\\infty$-categorical and infinitary algebraic theories. We establish many basic properties of the $\\infty$-categories of the models of different classes of theories, as well as recognition theorems identifying the $\\infty$-categories that arise this way. We give an intrinsic definition of a Malcev theory in higher universal algebra. We establish that the $\\infty$-category of models of a Malcev theory may be characterized as freely adjoining geometric realizations to the theory. This leads to the notion of a derived functor between $\\infty$-categories of models of Malcev theories, and we study the behavior of these derived functors with respect to connectivity and limits. We recall the notion of a loop theory and study in detail the interaction between functors and derived functors of $\\infty$-categories of loop models and models, establishing that a large class of comonads on the $\\infty$-category of loop models deform canonically to the $\\infty$-category of all models. In the last part of the paper, we show that by considering the coalgebras for these deformed comonads over $\\infty$-categories of models, one can recover various stable deformations considered in the literature, such as filtered models or Postnikov-complete synthetic spectra. We then expand on these results by constructing $\\infty$-categories of synthetic spaces and synthetic $\\mathbf{E}_k$-rings."

    "abstract": "The Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are emerging as the latest paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high. In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing dental diseases from radiographs is time-consuming and challenging due to the subtle nature of diagnostic evidence. Existing methods, which rely on object detection models designed for natural images with more distinct target patterns, struggle to detect dental diseases that present with far less visual support. To address this challenge, we propose {\\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks. This mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization, as the correlation between the two tasks is effectively captured. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/DentYOLOX."

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in sampling recovery, focusing on the accuracy of various algorithms and the relationship between optimal recovery errors, nonlinear approximation, and the Kolmogorov widths of function classes. A central theme is the synergy between the theory of universal sampling discretization and Lebesgue-type inequalities for greedy algorithms. We discuss three primary algorithmic frameworks: weighted least squares and $\\ell_p$ minimization, sparse approximation methods, and greedy algorithms such as the Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (WOMP) in Hilbert spaces and the Weak Tchebychev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in Banach spaces. These methods are applied to function classes defined by structural conditions, like the $A_β^r$ and Wiener-type classes, as well as classical Sobolev-type classes with dominated mixed derivatives. Notably, we highlight recent findings showing that nonlinear sampling recovery can provide superior error guarantees compared to linear methods for certain multivariate function classes."

    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

    "abstract": "As quantum devices continue to improve in scale and precision, a central challenge is how to effectively utilize noisy hardware for meaningful computation. Most existing approaches aim to recover noiseless circuit outputs from noisy ones through error mitigation or correction. Here, we show that noisy quantum devices can be directly leveraged as computational resources to enhance the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably. These results establish NDE-CS as a scalable hybrid simulation approach for quantum circuits, where noise can be harnessed as a computational asset."

This is the first result showing that a constant-degree condition yields an unbounded -- indeed nearly linear -- number of chords, placing our bound within a polylogarithmic factor of the Chen--Erdős--Staton conjecture.

    "abstract": "Generative AI systems are predominantly designed, evaluated, and marketed as intelligent systems which will benefit society by augmenting or automating human cognitive labor, promising to increase personal, corporate, and macroeconomic productivity. But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose \"thick entertainment\" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about \"intelligence\" as social media is about social connection."

Clients request content through ANs acting as gateways, without observing AN states or the actions of other clients. We define the reward as the age of information reduction resulting from a client's selection of an AN, and formulate the problem as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit. In this decentralized and partially observable setting, the resulting reward process is history-dependent and coupled across clients, and exhibits both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards, rendering classical bandit-based approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose the AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm, which combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions. We establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and we validate the theoretical results through simulations."

    "abstract": "Urban scaling theory posits that urban indicators follow power-law relations with population, yet the evolution of these patterns - and the role of regional differences in settings marked by social inequalities and unplanned urbanization - remains poorly understood. Here, we analyze nearly three decades of mortality data from Brazilian cities to investigate the scaling of external causes of death: homicides, suicides, and accidents. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and spatial correlation analysis, we find that these mortality indicators exhibit distinct, regionally heterogeneous scaling trajectories. Homicide mortality has significantly attenuated its typical superlinear scaling with increased spatial clustering, suggesting a redistribution of violence to smaller cities and intensified intercity interactions, possibly linked to the consolidation of organized crime. Suicide mortality, usually sublinear, has trended upward, implying a weakening of urban agglomerations' protective effect. Accident mortality remains superlinear, with transport fatalities scaling nearly proportionally, and non-transport accidents becoming superlinear. The scaling changes for suicides and accidents coincide with less correlated and stable spatial patterns, suggesting that the underlying processes predominantly operate within city boundaries. Finally, while scaling exponents have evolved more homogeneously across Brazilian states, scale-adjusted mortality remains highly heterogeneous, indicating that fundamental processes govern scaling laws, whereas state-specific factors drive scale-adjusted metrics."

In so doing, we also derive the acoustic sum rules for cylindrical geometries, which include a rigid-body rotational mode in addition to the three translational modes. We implement the cyclic- and helical-symmetry-adapted formalism within a high-order finite-difference discretization. Using carbon nanotubes as representative systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the framework through excellent agreement with periodic plane-wave results. We further apply the framework to compute the Young's and shear moduli of carbon nanotubes, as well as the scaling laws governing the dependence of ring and radial breathing mode phonon frequencies on nanotube diameter. The elastic moduli are found to be in agreement with previous density functional theory and experimental results, while the phonon scaling laws show qualitative agreement with previous atomistic simulations."

To address this inefficiency, we propose precomputing table representations as KV caches offline and querying the required ones online. A key aspect of our approach is the computation of table caches while preserving primary foreign key relationships between tables. Additionally, we construct a Table Trie structure to facilitate efficient KV cache lookups during inference. To enhance cache performance, we introduce a cache management system with a query reranking strategy to improve cache hit rates and a computation loading pipeline for parallelizing model inference and cache loading. Experimental results show that our proposed TableCache achieves up to a 3.62x speedup in Time to First Token (TTFT) with negligible performance degradation."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\\cos(\\bmω^{\\top}Δ\\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_i,\\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy."

We introduce an identifiability condition based on strong monotonicity that identifies sampling-model parameters without instrumental variables, even under informative (non-ignorable) selection, using auxiliary information from the probability sample; it remains valid without record linkage between samples. The second estimator, motivated by a two-stage sampling approximation, avoids explicit modeling of the non-probability mechanism; though not fully efficient, it is efficient within a restricted augmentation class and is robust to misspecification. Simulations and an application to the Culture and Community in a Time of Crisis public simulation dataset show efficiency gains under correct specification and stable performance under misspecification and weak identification.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs), which support services such as driving assistants and medical diagnoses, undergo lengthy and expensive training procedures. Therefore, the training's outcome - the DNN weights - represents a significant intellectual property asset to protect. Side-channel analysis (SCA) has recently appeared as an effective approach to recover this confidential asset from DNN implementations. In response, researchers have proposed to defend DNN implementations through classic side-channel countermeasures, at the cost of higher energy consumption, inference time, and resource utilisation. Following a different approach, Ding et al. (HOST'25) introduced MACPRUNING, a novel SCA countermeasure based on pruning, a performance-oriented Approximate Computing technique: at inference time, the implementation randomly prunes (or skips) non-important weights (i.e., with low contribution to the DNN's accuracy) of the first layer, exponentially increasing the side-channel resilience of the protected DNN implementation. However, the original security analysis of MACPRUNING did not consider a control-flow dependency intrinsic to the countermeasure design. This dependency may allow an attacker to circumvent MACPRUNING and recover the weights important to the DNN's accuracy. This paper describes a preprocessing methodology to exploit the above-mentioned control-flow dependency. Through practical experiments on a Chipwhisperer-Lite running a MACPRUNING-protected Multi-Layer Perceptron, we target the first 8 weights of each neuron and recover 96% of the important weights, demonstrating the drastic reduction in security of the protected implementation. Moreover, we show how microarchitectural leakage improves the effectiveness of our methodology, even allowing for the recovery of up to 100% of the targeted non-important weights. Lastly, by adapting our methodology [continue in pdf]."

To close this gap, we study how to make NCO explicitly population-based by learning policies that act on sets of candidate solutions. We first propose a simple taxonomy of population awareness levels and use it to highlight two key design challenges: (i) how to represent a whole population inside a neural network, and (ii) how to learn population dynamics that balance intensification (generating good solutions) and diversification (maintaining variety). We make these ideas concrete with two complementary tools: one that improves existing solutions using information shared across the whole population, and the other generates new candidate solutions that explicitly balance being high-quality with diversity. Experimental results on Maximum Cut and Maximum Independent Set indicate that incorporating population structure is advantageous for learned optimization methods and opens new connections between NCO and classical population-based search."

While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF."

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated \"experts\", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents."

In this paper we classify Rota{Baxter operators of weights zero and one on such algebras. We prove that every Rota{Baxter operator is upper triangular with respect to a natural basis. For weight zero, a strong rigidity phenomenon occurs: the operators are diagonal up to possible perturbations supported in the last basis vector. For weight one, a richer structure appears, including both triangular and non-triangular families, with the diagonal entries governed by a rational recurrence relation. Our results provide a complete description of Rota{Baxter operators on nilpotent evolution algebras of maximal nilindex."

    "abstract": "Aims: This study investigates whether a U-Net architecture can perform standalone end-to-end blind deconvolution of astronomical images without any prior knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) or noise characteristics. Our goal is to evaluate its performance against the number of training images, classical Tikhonov deconvolution and to assess its generalization capability under varying seeing conditions and noise levels. Methods: Realistic astronomical observations are simulated using the GalSim toolkit, incorporating random transformations, PSF convolution (accounting for both optical and atmospheric effects), and Gaussian white noise. A U-Net model is trained using a Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function on datasets of varying sizes, up to 40,000 images of size 48x48 from the COSMOS Real Galaxy Dataset. Performance is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity metrics, with the latter employed in a two-model framework to assess solution stability. Results: The U-Net model demonstrates effectiveness in blind deconvolution, with performance improving consistently as the training dataset size increases, saturating beyond 5,000 images. Cosine similarity analysis reveals convergence between independently trained models, indicating stable solutions. Remarkably, the U-Net outperforms the oracle-like Tikhonov method in challenging conditions (low PSNR/medium SSIM). The model also generalizes well to unseen seeing and noise conditions, although optimal performance is achieved when training parameters include validation conditions. Experiments on synthetic $C^α$ images further support the hypothesis that the U-Net learns a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis, akin to sparse representations observed in denoising tasks. These results align with recent mathematical insights into its adaptive learning capabilities."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%.

    "abstract": "The 2D Euler system, governing inviscid incompressible flow, admits infinitely many steady solutions. To identify which are physically realizable, we investigate the vanishing viscosity limit of the steady Navier-Stokes system. Here, a steady Euler flow with a slip boundary condition is called a vanishing viscosity limit if it is the $L^\\infty_{\\textup{loc}}\\cap H^1_{\\textup{loc}}$ limit of steady Navier-Stokes solutions (it is known that strong boundary layers can persist). We then completely classify the vanishing viscosity limit in specific planar domains. In a bounded connected domain, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limit is the constant-vorticity flow. This result does not require the approximating Navier-Stokes solutions to have nested closed streamlines, an essential assumption in the century-old Prandtl-Batchelor theorem. In a strip where the Navier-Stokes velocity (but not the pressure) is periodic in the strip direction, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limits are constant flow, Couette flow, and Poiseuille flow. The proof of the latter result relies on the former and on a powerful rigidity theorem, which asserts that any non-shear steady Euler flow in a periodic strip must have contractible closed streamlines."

The dataset, containing 34 languages and over ten thousand items, allows comparative analyses of idiomatic patterns among language-specific realisations and preferences in order to gather insights about shared cultural aspects. This parallel dataset allows to evaluate model performance for a given PIE in different languages and whether idiomatic understanding in one language can be transferred to another. Moreover, the dataset supports the study of PIEs across textual and visual modalities, to measure to what extent PIE understanding in one modality transfers or implies in understanding in another modality (text vs. image). The data was created by language experts, with both textual and visual components crafted under multilingual guidelines, and each PIE is accompanied by five images representing a spectrum from idiomatic to literal meanings, including semantically related and random distractors. The result is a high-quality benchmark for evaluating multilingual and multimodal idiomatic language understanding."

CO emission is detected in 9 new galaxies, and in 12 of 60 total, doubling the number of CO-emitting HI-selected galaxies and probing 1.2 dex deeper in molecular gas mass than previous studies. These galaxies span a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities. By comparing CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) properties with star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities from VLT/MUSE and HST, we find a dual behaviour in star formation efficiency: low-mass systems follow main-sequence scaling relations, while high-mass systems show suppressed star formation.

These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \\subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\\mathrm{Rep}((\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\\rtimes\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry."

Road scenarios are clustered based on geometric and dynamic features of the ADAS driving behavior, from which representative cases are selected to guarantee coverage. Roads are finally prioritized based on geometric complexity, driving difficulty, and historical failures, ensuring that the most critical and challenging tests are executed first. We evaluate our framework on the OPENCAT dataset and the Udacity self-driving car simulator using two ADAS models. On average, our approach achieves an 89% reduction in test suite size while retaining an average of 79% of failed road scenarios. The prioritization strategy improves early failure detection by up to 95x compared to random baselines."

However, existing SFDA approaches struggle with the trade-off between perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA.

A known issue is that the standard debiasing rule can yield a vector with negative values (which can not be interpreted as a histogram), and there is no consensus on the best fix. An elegant but slow solution is the Iterative Bayesian Update algorithm (IBU), which converges to the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) as the number of iterations goes to infinity.

Using the C*-algebra framework of statistical mechanics, we treat systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, primarily focusing on quantum lattice models where tools such as Lieb-Robinson bounds yield rigorous statements. We thus provide a proof-of-principle that large-scale behaviours can indeed be seen as emerging from microscopic dynamics, with mathematical proof. We first report on ergodicity results in short-range models with exponentially decaying or finite-range interactions. We show that time-averaged observables converge to their ensemble averages and decorrelate from all other observables almost everywhere within the light-cone defined by Lieb-Robinson bounds. This relaxation property indicates the loss of information at large scales, from which we prove a Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: at the Euler scaling limit of large time and distance, observables project onto hydrodynamic modes (extensive conserved quantities), within correlation functions. These results hold independently of microscopic details, capturing the physical idea that such details are lost at large space-time scales. Regarding finer scales of hydrodynamics, we discuss rigorous lower bounds on the strength of diffusion. We establish a general result on the clustering of n-th order connected correlations within C* dynamical systems. These results are applied to obtain a strictly positive lower bound on the diffusion constant of chaotic open quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. This thesis underlines the universality of hydrodynamic principles, provides a framework for establishing them rigorously, and sets the stage for future progress toward the goal of proving the hydrodynamic equations."

    "abstract": "Bayesian methods constitute a popular approach for estimating the conditional independence structure in Gaussian graphical models, since they can quantify the uncertainty through the posterior distribution. Inference in this framework is typically carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, the most widely used choice of prior distribution for the precision matrix, the so called G-Wishart distribution, suffers from an intractable normalizing constant, which gives rise to the problem of double intractability in the updating steps of the MCMC algorithm. In this article, we propose a new class of prior distributions for the precision matrix, termed ST priors, that allow for the construction of MCMC algorithms that do not suffer from double intractability issues. A realization from an ST prior distribution is obtained by applying a sparsifying transform on a matrix from a distribution with support in the set of all positive definite matrices. We carefully present the theory behind the construction of our proposed class of priors and also perform some numerical experiments, where we apply our methods on a human gene expression dataset. The results suggest that our proposed MCMC algorithm is able to converge and achieve acceptable mixing when applied on the real data."

Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

A notable instance occurs in locally conformal analysis, where local representatives coincide only up to conformal factors. The locally conformal approach not only enables the definition of novel and rich geometric structures but also provides Hamiltonian formulations for irreversible systems, yielding physically meaningful dynamical consequences. While extensively studied for symplectic, cosymplectic, and Poisson geometries, its systematic extension to multi-Hamiltonian settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate locally conformally Nambu--Poisson and locally conformally generalized Poisson manifolds, showing that these structures naturally induce Nambu--Jacobi and generalized Jacobi manifolds, respectively. From a dynamical point of view, we construct Hamiltonian-type evolution equations, and for locally conformal $3$-Nambu structures, we introduce locally conformal bi-Hamiltonian systems. The resulting dynamics are particularly suitable for modeling irreversible multi-Hamiltonian processes, as they generally do not preserve the system's energy. Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for understanding both the geometric structures and Hamiltonian dynamics of classical, Nambu--Poisson, and generalized Poisson manifolds within a locally conformal context."

    "abstract": "Filamentous bacteriophages fd are viral particles, highly monodisperse in size, that have been widely used as a model colloidal system for studying the self-assembly of rod-shaped particles as well as a versatile template in nanoscience. In aqueous suspensions, fd viruses exhibit lyotropic behavior, forming liquid crystalline phases as their concentration increases. Here, we report a solvent-free system displaying thermotropic phase behavior, achieved through covalent coupling of low molecular weight PEG-based polymer surfactant onto the fd virus surface. Upon lyophilization of aqueous suspensions of these polymer-grafted bacteriophages and subsequent thermal annealing, a solvent-free material is obtained, exhibiting both viscoelasticity and, notably, thermotropic liquid crystalline properties. A combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and optical microscopy experiments reveals the formation of an ordered hexagonal mesophase below 30 °C, which undergoes a melting transition into an isotropic liquid at higher temperatures. Our results demonstrate an efficient approach for converting lyotropic into thermotropic phase behavior in the columnar liquid crystalline phase of filamentous fd colloids. This approach paves the way for extending such functionalization to other technologically relevant rod-like systems, such as carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanocrystals, enabling the introduction of thermotropic properties in anhydrous colloidal materials."

    "abstract": "Recently, the LHCb collaboration reported the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays, with a significance of more than $5σ$. This strongly motivates us to investigate the $CP$ violation in more baryon decay processes. In this work, we employ the final-state rescattering mechanism with introducing two model parameters, $Λ_{charm}$ and $Λ_{charmless}$, and calculate two-body non-leptonic baryon decays $Λ^0_b \\rightarrow Λ(1520)\\,π^0/κ(700)/f_0(500, 980)/ρ^0/K^{*0}/φ$ and $Ξ^-_b \\rightarrow Λ(1520)\\,K^-$. Consequently, we evaluate the corresponding branching ratios, $CP$ asymmetries, and interference effects between different decay amplitudes. Our theoretical predictions for certain decay channels are in good agreement with current experimental measurements, while the remaining processes--particularly the remarkably large $CP$ violation observable revealed by the kinematic analysis are expected to be tested in future experiments."

    "abstract": "Battery-free Internet of Things (BF-IoT) enabled by backscatter communication is a rapidly evolving technology offering advantages of low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and robustness. However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers. Moreover, we present the implementation of a meta-backscatter system prototype and report the experimental results based on it. Finally, we conclude by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research."

The system is described by two-dimensional in-plane linear elasticity, and the slits are treated as voids. The conversion is quantified by the ratio between the reflected shear-wave energy and the incident compressional-wave energy, obtained from mode decomposition and energy-flux evaluation below the surface. The results indicate that the inclined geometry introduces strong coupling between normal and tangential motions at the boundary, enabling suppression of the ordinary compressional reflection while redirecting the reflected energy into the shear channel. This simple, geometry-controlled mechanism provides a compact route for low-frequency elastic-wave polarization control."

Solving the GPE on a single mesh, even with adaptive refinement, can lead to excessive computational costs due to the need to accommodate the most oscillatory solution. To address this issue, we present a multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for solving the GPE. To this end, we first convert it into a time-dependent equation through the imaginary time propagation method. Then the equation is discretized by the backward Euler method temporally and the multi-mesh adaptive finite element method spatially. The proposed method is compared with the single-mesh adaptive method through a series of numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the multi-mesh adaptive method can achieve the same numerical accuracy with less computational consumption."

This issue is particularly pressing for tackling fraud in the red wine industry, valued at billions of dollars globally, where product authenticity, brand reputation, and consumer trust are paramount. Whilst many techniques exist for authenticating wine externally, to date performing accurate classification of the contents within unopened bottles remains elusive. Using only a single near-infrared optical excitation source operating at a wavelength of 785 nm, in combination with a bespoke geometry to circumvent the confounding signal of the glass, we demonstrate that through-bottle fluorescence spectra can distinguish between twenty different red wines in their original, intact bottles. All twenty wine bottles were correctly classified with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong varietal grouping. This non-invasive and rapid technique has the potential to enable on-site, routine wine authentication to combat the growing issue of wine fraud. The geometry itself is applicable across multiple fields for the analysis of other high-value products through their packaging, where authenticity verification is critical."

Leveraging BERTopic, we extract semantically coherent topics. Each topic is converted into a structured prompt, enabling a language model to generate meaningful topic labels and summaries in a zero-shot manner. Querying and document exploration are supported via dense embeddings and vector search, while a dedicated evaluation module assesses topical coherence and bias. This framework supports scalable and interpretable information access in specialized domains where labeled data is limited."

    "abstract": "We introduce the Markovian Pre-trained Transformer (MPT) for next-item recommendation, a transferable model fully pre-trained on synthetic Markov chains, yet capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance by fine-tuning a lightweight adaptor. This counterintuitive success stems from the observation of the `Markovian' nature: advanced sequential recommenders coincidentally rely on the latest interaction to make predictions, while the historical interactions serve mainly as auxiliary cues for inferring the user's general, non-sequential identity. This characteristic necessitates the capabilities of a universal recommendation model to effectively summarize the user sequence, with particular emphasis on the latest interaction. MPT inherently has the potential to be universal and transferable. On the one hand, when trained to predict the next state of Markov chains, it acquires the capabilities to estimate transition probabilities from the context (one adaptive manner for summarizing sequences) and attend to the last state to ensure accurate state transitions. On the other hand, unlike the heterogeneous interaction data, an unlimited amount of controllable Markov chains is available to boost the model capacity. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets from three distinct platforms to validate the superiority of Markovian pre-training over traditional recommendation pre-training and recent language pre-training paradigms."

We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC."

To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-CoReasoner, a language-informed co-reasoning framework that elicits parallel English and local-language reasoning, abstracts them into structured concepts, and integrates local clinical knowledge into an English logical scaffold via concept-level alignment and retrieval. This design combines the structural robustness of English reasoning with the practice-grounded expertise encoded in local languages. To evaluate multilingual medical reasoning beyond multiple-choice settings, we construct MultiMed-X, a benchmark covering seven languages with expert-annotated long-form question answering and natural language inference tasks, comprising 350 instances per language. Experiments across three benchmarks show that Med-CoReasoner improves multilingual reasoning performance by an average of 5%, with particularly substantial gains in low-resource languages. Moreover, model distillation and expert evaluation analysis further confirm that Med-CoReasoner produces clinically sound and culturally grounded reasoning traces."

AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain."

This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B).

This take the reference frame calibration between communicating parties as a necessary prerequisite. However, in mobile communications scenarios, achieving continuous and accurate reference frame calibration poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reference-frame-independent (RFI) QSDC protocol. This protocol only requires ensuring the calibration accuracy of one direction of the reference frame, while allowing a misalignment angle $β$ in the other two directions. To improve the protocol's robustness against reference frame fluctuations, we introduce a $β$-independent parameter C into the security analysis framework and rederive the protocol's security bounds. Additionally, we construct a system model and optimize the pulse intensity of the signal states, enabling the protocol to achieve optimal performance under each level of channel attenuation. At an attenuation of 10 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of 25 km), the secrecy message capacities for $β= 0^{ \\circ} $ and $45^{ \\circ} $ are $8.765 \\times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse and $4.150 \\times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse, respectively. Compared with the single-photon-based QSDC, the communication distance of the protocol proposed in this paper is significantly extended. When $β= 0^{ \\circ} $ and $45^{ \\circ} $, the maximum transmission distances of the RFI QSDC protocol are 27.875 km and 26.750 km, which is about 155.9 % and 149.7 % of that of the single-photon-based QSDC protocol."

The experiment was conducted at Darbandikhan Technical Institute, Sulaimani Polytechnic University, Iraq, from February to June 2025. The results showed that soaking duration had significant effect on rooting percentage, while the highest rooting percentage (60%) was obtained from the non-soaked cuttings, but prolonged soaking (48 h) resulted in the lowest rooting percentage (33.33%). Rooting substrate had a significant impact, with sand showing superior performance (75.56%) compared to the mixture (46.67%) and peat moss alone (20%). Moreover, the interactions between soaking duration and substrate revealed that soaking for 24 hours combined with sand yielded the highest rooting percentage (93.33%), while 48-hour soaking in peat moss led to complete rooting failure (0%). Root length and number were maximized in the 48 h + sand and 48 h + sand/peat moss treatments, while root biomass was highest in the 24 h + sand combination. Shoot characteristics were generally best in the control (0 h soaking), with the highest shoot length, diameter, weight, and chlorophyll content. However, the combination of 48 h soaking and sand/peat moss mixture resulted in the highest shoot length (35.44 cm) and leaf number (122), while 48 h + peat moss treatment suppressed all growth parameters. Consequently, the results suggest that immediate planting in sand or a sand/peat moss mix supports optimal rooting and shoot development."

In this work, we employ a multiscale Spin-Lattice Dynamics (SLD) approach to investigate the magnetostructural correlations in amorphous Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ nanodisks ($x=35, 50, 65$). By integrating classical molecular dynamics with a generalized magnetic Hamiltonian, we capture the dynamic feedback loop between lattice vibrations and spin precession. Topological analysis via Voronoi tessellation reveals a persistent species-dependent structural heterogeneity: Cobalt atoms preferentially adopt \"solid-like\" icosahedral packing, forming a rigid structural backbone, whereas Iron atoms exhibit a higher propensity for \"liquid-like\" disordered environments. We demonstrate that this topological disparity dictates the macroscopic magnetic response. The Cobalt-driven structural stiffness preserves a robust exchange network that maximizes saturation magnetization, while the local disorder inherent to Iron-rich regions introduces exchange fluctuations that act as an intrinsic damping mechanism, delaying magnetic relaxation. These findings provide an atomistic explanation for the stability of ferromagnetic order in Co-Fe metallic glasses and offer a pathway for tuning damping parameters in amorphous spintronic devices through stoichiometric control."

However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V > 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$α$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$α$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3σ$) flux variation of the broad H$α$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$α$ complex and the [SII]$λ\\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$α$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST."

    "abstract": "Lightweight vision networks have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet achieving a satisfactory balance among parameter scale, computational overhead, and task performance remains difficult. Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models."

    "abstract": "Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \\textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \\textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning.

In both settings, we establish the \\textit{first optimal} $\\mathcal O(n^{-1/2})$ rate in $\\mathcal W_1$, as well as the first $\\mathcal W_p$ ($p\\ge 2$) CLT rates under mild moment assumptions, substantially improving the best previously known bounds in these dependent-data regimes. As an application of our optimal $\\mathcal W_1$ rate for locally dependent sequences, we further obtain the first optimal $\\mathcal W_1$--CLT rate for multivariate $U$-statistics. On the technical side, we derive a tractable auxiliary bound for $\\mathcal W_1$ Gaussian approximation errors that is well suited to studying dependent data. For Markov chains, we further prove that the regeneration time of the split chain associated with a geometrically ergodic chain has a geometric tail without assuming strong aperiodicity or other restrictive conditions.

Our research indicates that there are theoretical flaws in Zhang et al.'s use of a simple corner model to obtain a series of corner characteristics, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points. The experimental results have verified that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization error, robustness to image blur transformation, image matching, and 3D reconstruction."

Results demonstrate that freezing significantly enhances the dynamic strength and brittleness of saturated sandstone.The pore structure undergoes substantial evolution with decreasing temperature, with the porosity increasing by 63.15%.Based on PFC3D microscopic simulations, the mechanism of frost heave damage and the regulatory effect of water-ice phase transition on rock mechanical behaviors are elucidated.A quantitative analysis method for energy dissipation is proposed, revealing that the energy absorption increment of frozen rocks is higher than that of room-temperature samples.The findings provide a theoretical basis and technical support for optimizing blasting parameters, realizing directional energy release,and promoting green construction of frozen rock masses in high-altitude areas."

While recent datasets provide human annotations for clarity and evasion, the impact of prompt design on automatic clarity evaluation remains underexplored. In this paper, we study prompt-based clarity evaluation using the CLARITY dataset from the SemEval 2026 shared task. We compare a GPT-3.5 baseline provided with the dataset against GPT-5.2 evaluated under three prompting strategies: simple prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought with few-shot examples. Model predictions are evaluated against human annotations using accuracy and class-wise metrics for clarity and evasion, along with hierarchical exact match. Results show that GPT-5.2 consistently outperforms the GPT-3.5 baseline on clarity prediction, with accuracy improving from 56 percent to 63 percent under chain-of-thought with few-shot prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting yields the highest evasion accuracy at 34 percent, though improvements are less stable across fine-grained evasion categories. We further evaluate topic identification and find that reasoning-based prompting improves accuracy from 60 percent to 74 percent relative to human annotations. Overall, our findings indicate that prompt design reliably improves high-level clarity evaluation, while fine-grained evasion and topic detection remain challenging despite structured reasoning prompts."

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a \"trainee\" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \\method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

While these algorithmic components are established in evolutionary computing, their tailored integration and specific tuning for control design tasks represent a novel application in this context. Experimental evaluations on $H_{\\infty}$ controller synthesis and spectral abscissa optimization demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing BMI solvers in terms of both solution quality and robustness.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the Pareto boundary performance of a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system that addresses both sensing and communication functions at the same time. In this scenario, a multiple-antenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna communication users while concurrently estimating the parameters of a single sensing object using the echo signal. We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object. Furthermore, we reveal the Pareto boundary for the multi-user case, with variations in the number of communication users and the number of transmitting and receiving antennas. We provide the Pareto boundary depending on EIRP limitations for the single-user case."

Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts. Extensive experiments across various MLLMs and benchmarks validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed approach improves multimodal reasoning performance. Code will be released."

The medium-modified cluster structures under the Pauli blocking and the picture of Mott transitions in nuclear medium are discussed in detail. We find that the weakly bound deuteron survives to higher densities as compared with the more compact $α$-particle in symmetric nuclear matter, with its r.m.s. radius expanding markedly prior to its dissolution. Moreover, the Mott density of $α$-particle is slightly lower in neutron-rich matter than in symmetric matter. These results may provide useful constraints for the formation of light clusters at nuclear surface and the cluster yields in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions."

    "abstract": "Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios."

Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning."

A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL."

We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error $ε_{L_2} \\approx 1.92 \\times 10^{-2}$, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants ($|ΔN_{defects}| < 1$). We solve the ill-posed \\textit{inverse pinning problem}, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation $ρ= 0.965$). Training dynamics reveal a distinctive Spectral Phase Transition at epoch $\\sim 2,100$, where cooperative minimization of physics and geometry losses drives the solver to Pareto-optimal solutions. This work establishes a new paradigm for Geometric Catalyst Design, offering a mesh-free, data-driven tool for identifying surface heterogeneity and engineering passive control strategies in turbulent chemical reactors."

We find that (1) power spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies both for the strong and weak turbulence resemble those observed in the non-relativistic MHD turbulence; (2) intermittency of magnetic fields in strong turbulence is stronger than that in the weak one; (3) generated Alfvén modes show similar energy spectra and scale-dependent anisotropies to those of non-relativistic case; (4) generated fast modes present a power spectrum similar to that of Alfvén modes, with a strong (for strong turbulence) or weak (for weak turbulence) scale-dependent anisotropy, which are significantly different from non-relativistic turbulence; and (5) applications of our numerical results to neutron star magnetospheres show that the strong (or moderately weak) turbulent cascade can explain the X-ray radiation of the Vela pulsar. Our study is of great significance for understanding energy transfer, magnetic field evolution, and particle acceleration mechanisms in extreme astrophysical environments."

It is well known that this sequence is either polynomially bounded or grows exponentially. In the polynomial case, a central problem in PI-theory is the classification of varieties ${V}$ for which $c_n^*({V}) \\approx αn^k$ for a given $k$. One of the main objectives of this paper is to classify minimal varieties of unitary algebras endowed with a superinvolution that exhibit quadratic codimension growth. We obtain a structural characterization, up to PI-equivalence, of all unitary algebras with quadratic codimension growth. As a consequence, we show that any unitary variety of quadratic codimension growth is generated by a direct sum of algebras generating minimal varieties."

    "abstract": "Firmware integrity is a foundational requirement for securing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where malicious or compromised firmware can result in persistent backdoors, unauthorized control, or catastrophic system failures. Traditional verification mechanisms such as secure boot, digital signatures, and centralized hash databases are increasingly inadequate due to risks from insider threats and single points of failure. In this paper, we propose a decentralized firmware integrity verification framework built on the Ethereum blockchain, offering tamperproof, transparent, and trustless validation. Our system stores SHA-256 hashes of firmware binaries within smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, using Web3 and Infura for seamless on-chain interaction. A Python-based client tool computes firmware hashes and communicates with the blockchain to register and verify firmware authenticity in realtime. We implement and evaluate a fully functional prototype using real firmware samples, demonstrating successful contract deployment, hash registration, and integrity verification through live blockchain transactions. Experimental results confirm the reliability and low cost (in gas fees) of our approach, highlighting its practicality and scalability for real-world CPS applications. To enhance scalability and performance, we discuss extensions using Layer-2 rollups and off-chain storage via the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). We also outline integration pathways with secure boot mechanisms, Trusted Platform Module (TPM)based attestation, and zero-trust architectures. This work contributes a practical and extensible model for blockchain-based firmware verification, significantly strengthening the defense against firmware tampering and supply chain attacks in critical CPS environments."

    "abstract": "Traditional 2D hydraulic models face significant computational challenges that limit their applications that are time-sensitive or require many model evaluations. This study presents a physics-informed Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) framework for computational hydraulics modeling that learns the solution operator of the 2D shallow water equations (SWEs) to create fast surrogate models. The framework can operate in two modes: a purely data-driven SWE-DeepONet that learns from numerical solver such as SRH-2D, and a physics-informed PI-SWE-DeepONet that additionally incorporates the continuous SWEs as constraints during training. Based on a real-world case, steady flows in a reach of the Sacramento River in California, it is demonstrated that PI-SWE-DeepONet possesses much enhanced prediction capability than SWE-DeepONet when applied to out-of-distribution scenarios. The physics-informed model is shown to exhibit slower error growth and larger breakdown distances in comparison with SWE-DeepONet. The gain of the physics-informed training, however, comes with costs, chief among which are the simulated results have slightly higher errors for in-distribution cases. It reflects the existence of a tension between the two competing training objectives: fitting the results from the traditional hydraulic model and satisfying the continuous governing equations. In this study, guidelines are developed for selecting the appropriate approach based on a real-world case: PI-SWE-DeepONet is preferred for out-of-distribution predictions, uncertain training data, or when physical consistency is a priority, while SWE-DeepONet is recommended if the modeling objective is to replicate faithfully the traditional hydraulic model results within the training distribution. Other challenges are also discussed, such as the loss weighting approach."

At each step, feedback from qubit measurements is used to inform the next quantum circuit update. In practice, the sampling cost associated with these measurements can be significant. Here, we ask whether FQA parameter sequences can be predicted using classical machine learning, obviating the need for qubit measurements altogether. To this end, we train a teacher-student model to map a MaxCut problem instance to an associated FQA parameter curve in a single classical inference step. Numerical experiments show that this model can accurately predict FQA parameter curves across a range of problem sizes, including problem sizes not seen during model training. To evaluate performance, we compare the predicted parameter curves in simulation against FQA reference curves and linear quantum annealing schedules. We observe similar results to the former and performance improvements over the latter. These results suggest that machine learning can offer a heuristic, practical path to reducing sampling costs and resource overheads in quantum algorithms."

Recent advances in natural language processing and agentic AI offer ways to improve how organizations share and use data. But many barriers remain. Today's tools require technical skills and multiple roles to discover, request, and query data. Automating data access using enterprise AI agents is limited by the means to discover and autonomously access distributed data. Current solutions either compromise governance or break agentic workflows through manual approvals. To close this gap, we introduce Data Product MCP integrated in a data product marketplace. This data marketplace, already in use at large enterprises, enables AI agents to find, request, and query enterprise data products while enforcing data contracts in real time without lowering governance standards. The system is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and links the AI-driven marketplace with cloud platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, and Google Cloud Platform. It supports semantic discovery of data products based on business context, automates access control by validating generated queries against approved business purposes using AI-driven checks, and enforces contracts in real time by blocking unauthorized queries before they run. We assessed the system with feedback from $n=16$ experts in data governance. Our qualitative evaluation demonstrates effectiveness through enterprise scenarios such as customer analytics. The findings suggest that Data Product MCP reduces the technical burden for data analysis without weakening governance, filling a key gap in enterprise AI adoption."

    "abstract": "Optical spectroscopy based on second-order nonlinearity is a critical technique for characterizing two-dimensional (2D) crystals as well as bioimaging and quantum optics. It is generally believed that second-harmonic generation (SHG) in centrosymmetric crystals, such as graphene and other bilayer 2D crystals, is negligible without externally breaking the inversion symmetry. Here, we show that with a new homodyne detection technique, we can apparently circumvent this symmetry-imposed constraint and observe robust SHG in pristine centrosymmetric crystals, without any symmetry-breaking field. With its exceptional sensitivity, we resolve polarization-resolved SHG in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), bilayer 2H-WSe$_2$, and remarkably, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, allowing us to unambiguously identify the crystallographic orientation in these crystals via SHG for the first time. We also demonstrate that the new technique can be used to non-invasively detect uniaxial strain and optical geometric phase in these crystals. The observed SHG in our experiments is attributed to second-order nonlinearity in the quadrupole channel, which is controlled by the presence of the $C_2$ symmetry instead of the inversion symmetry. Our new technique expands the capability of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to encompass a large class of centrosymmetric materials that could never be measured before, and can be used for quantum sensing of moiré materials and twisted epitaxial films."

    "abstract": "Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \\leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \\%$."

Conversely, using these properties as axioms leads to a class of algebraic structures called para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. This paper carries out a systematic study of para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras. After their basic properties and examples from Hurwitz series and difference algebras, a Gröbner-Shirshov bases theory is established for para-differential Rota-Baxter algebras.

Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\\sim$$6.0 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization."

We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets.

However, how to rigorously evaluate these systems remains under-explored. Existing deep-research benchmarks often fall into two failure modes. Some do not adequately test a system's ability to analyze evidence and write coherent reports. Others rely on evaluation criteria that are either overly coarse or directly defined by LLMs (or both), leading to scores that can be biased relative to human experts and are hard to verify or interpret. To address these issues, we introduce Deep Research Bench II, a new benchmark for evaluating DRS-generated reports. It contains 132 grounded research tasks across 22 domains; for each task, a system must produce a long-form research report that is evaluated by a set of 9430 fine-grained binary rubrics in total, covering three dimensions: information recall, analysis, and presentation. All rubrics are derived from carefully selected expert-written investigative articles and are constructed through a four-stage LLM+human pipeline that combines automatic extraction with over 400 human-hours of expert review, ensuring that the criteria are atomic, verifiable, and aligned with human expert judgment. We evaluate several state-of-the-art deep-research systems on Deep Research Bench II and find that even the strongest models satisfy fewer than 50% of the rubrics, revealing a substantial gap between current DRSs and human experts."

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments."

    "abstract": "Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in light dark matter searches and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments as they can achieve low energy thresholds. The phonon mediated sensing of silicon particle absorbers has already been proved with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), acting both as sensors and athermal phonon absorbers at the same time. In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five."

    "abstract": "Destination-passing style programming introduces destinations, which represent the address of a write-once memory cell. These destinations can be passed as function parameters, allowing the caller to control memory management: the callee simply fills the cell instead of allocating space for a return value. While typically used in systems programming, destination passing also has applications in pure functional programming, where it enables programs that were previously unexpressible using usual immutable data structures. In this thesis, we develop a core λ-calculus with destinations, {λ_d}. Our new calculus is more expressive than similar existing systems, with destination passing designed to be as flexible as possible. This is achieved through a modal type system combining linear types with a system of ages to manage scopes, in order to make destination-passing safe. Type safety of our core calculus was proved formally with the Coq proof assistant. Then, we see how this core calculus can be adapted into an existing pure functional language, Haskell, whose type system is less powerful than our custom theoretical one. Retaining safety comes at the cost of removing some flexibility in the handling of destinations. We later refine the implementation to recover much of this flexibility, at the cost of increased user complexity. The prototype implementation in Haskell shows encouraging results for adopting destination-passing style programming when traversing or mapping over large data structures such as lists or data trees."

For both applications of the Langevin diffusions, we establish convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on challenging multimodal distributions across a range of dimensions, as well as its effectiveness in Bayesian inference tasks."

The proposed learning rule preserves strict synaptic locality, admits linear-time complexity, and enables efficient supervised learning without backpropagation, surrogate gradients, or teacher forcing. We integrate supervised SADP within hybrid CNN-SNN architectures, where convolutional encoders provide compact feature representations that are converted into Poisson spike trains for agreement-driven learning in the SNN. Extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and biomedical image classification tasks demonstrate competitive performance and fast convergence. Additional analyses show stable performance across broad hyperparameter ranges and compatibility with device-inspired synaptic update dynamics.

The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws."

    "abstract": "Neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are emerging as a popular quantum computing technology due to their large qubit counts and flexible connectivity. However, performance challenges arise as large circuits experience significant fidelity drops, while small circuits underutilize hardware and face initialization latency issues. To tackle these problems, we propose $\\textit{multi-programming on neutral atom QPUs}$, allowing the co-execution of multiple circuits by logically partitioning the qubit array. This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming. To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose. MultiQ addresses three main challenges: (i) it compiles circuits into a $\\textit{virtual zone layout}$ to optimize spatio-temporal hardware utilization; (ii) it parallelizes the execution of co-located circuits, allowing single hardware instructions to operate on different circuits; and (iii) it includes an algorithm to verify the functional independence of the bundled circuits. MultiQ functions as a cross-layer system comprising a compiler, controller, and checker. Our compiler generates \\emph{virtual zone layouts} to enhance performance, while the controller efficiently maps these layouts onto the hardware and resolves any conflicts. The checker ensures the correct bundling of circuits. Experimental results show a throughput increase from 3.8$\\times$ to 12.3$\\times$ when multi-programming 4 to 14 circuits, with fidelity largely maintained, ranging from a 1.3% improvement for four circuits to only a 3.5% loss for fourteen circuits. Overall, MultiQ facilitates concurrent execution of multiple quantum circuits, boosting throughput and hardware utilization."

Existing solutions either require substantial training data or rely on domain-specific rules that limit scalability. In this paper, we present MHEL-LLaMo (Multilingual Historical Entity Linking with Large Language MOdels), an unsupervised ensemble approach combining a Small Language Model (SLM) and an LLM. MHEL-LLaMo leverages a multilingual bi-encoder (BELA) for candidate retrieval and an instruction-tuned LLM for NIL prediction and candidate selection via prompt chaining. Our system uses SLM's confidence scores to discriminate between easy and hard samples, applying an LLM only for hard cases. This strategy reduces computational costs while preventing hallucinations on straightforward cases. We evaluate MHEL-LLaMo on four established benchmarks in six European languages (English, Finnish, French, German, Italian and Swedish) from the 19th and 20th centuries. Results demonstrate that MHEL-LLaMo outperforms state-of-the-art models without requiring fine-tuning, offering a scalable solution for low-resource historical EL. The implementation of MHEL-LLaMo is available on Github."

    "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "We investigate a failure mode of large language models (LLMs) in which plain-text prompts elicit excessive outputs, a phenomenon we term Overflow. Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance."

Existing methods have demonstrated agility on parkour courses but often rely on end-to-end sensorimotor models with limited generalization and interpretability. By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments."

Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude."

    "abstract": "Reliable zero-shot detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for deploying vision-language models in open-world settings. However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC by 1.33% and reducing FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines."

To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications."

Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability.

Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models. The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction."

    "abstract": "The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC."

    "abstract": "Echocardiographic diagnosis is vital for cardiac screening yet remains challenging. Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available."

    "abstract": "In the Lagrange-Newton method, where Newton's method is applied to a Lagrangian function that includes equality constraints, all stationary points are saddle points. It is therefore not possible to use a line-search method based on the value of the objective function; instead, the line search can operate on merit functions. In this report, we explore an alternative line-search method which is applicable to this case; it particulary addresses the damping of the step length in tight valleys. We propose a line-search criterion based on the divergence of the field of Newton step vectors. The visualization of the criterion for two-dimensional test functions reveals a network of ravines with flat bottom at the zero points of the criterion. The ravines are typically connected to stationary points. To traverse this ravine network in order to approach a stationary point, a zigzag strategy is devised. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the novel line-search strategy succeeds from most starting points in all test functions, but only exhibits the desired damping of the step length in some situations. At the present stage it is therefore difficult to appraise the utility of this contribution."

To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework.

    "abstract": "Online on-policy preference learning algorithms for language model alignment such as online direct policy optimization (DPO) can significantly outperform their offline counterparts. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations."

Accurately accounting for the effects of aerosols is key to reconstructing atmospheric properties from transit spectra, yet this remains a significant challenge. To advance this effort, it is invaluable to examine the spectral features of well-characterized planetary atmospheres. Here, we synthesize empirical transit spectra of Mars across different seasons based on data from the NOMAD's Solar Occultation channel onboard ExoMars/TGO, which operates at wavelengths of 0.2-0.65 and 2-4 micron. In the generated empirical transit spectra, the atmosphere below 25 km is found to be largely opaque due to the presence of micron-sized dust and water ice clouds, both of which substantially weaken spectral features. The spectra exhibit CO2 absorption features at 2.7-2.8 micron and signatures of sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds around 3.1 micron, accompanied by a continuum slope. The amplitudes of these spectral features are found to vary with the Martian seasons, where the dust storms weaken the CO2 signatures and strengthen the water ice features, which serve as potential indicators of a dusty planet like Mars. If TRAPPIST-1f possessed a Mars-like atmospheric structure, both CO2 and water ice features would be detectable at a noise level of 3 ppm, a level likely beyond current observational capabilities. Nevertheless, the 3.1 micron feature produced by sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds offers a novel avenue for characterizing the atmospheres of habitable-zone exoplanets."

To address this limitation, we introduce the \\textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\\boldsymbolμ$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations."

Our system combines a heralded single-photon source with a reconfigurable interferometric mesh to implement qutrit state preparation, transformations, and measurements suitable for testing a KCBS contextuality inequality. This architecture enables the generation of random numbers from the intrinsic randomness of single-photon interference in a complex optical network, while simultaneously allowing a quantitative certification of their security without requiring entanglement. We observe a contextuality violation exceeding the classical bound by more than 10σ, unambiguously confirming non-classical behavior. From this violation, we certify a conditional min-entropy per experimental round of Hmin = 0.077 +- 0.002, derived via a tailored semidefinite-programming-based security analysis. Each measurement outcome therefore contains at least 0.077 +- 0.002 bits of extractable genuine randomness, corresponding to an asymptotic generation rate of 21.7 +- 0.5 bits/s. These results establish a viable route towards general-purpose, untrusted quantum random number generators compatible with practical integrated photonic quantum networks."

The rotation curve was selected in such a way that there would be no dominant burst of circular velocities in the central ($R<2$ kpc) region of the Galaxy. As a result, we constructed two two-component models of the galactic potential, which include contributions from the disk and the halo of invisible matter, as well as a three-component model with a small-mass bulge added in advance. These models can be useful in studying the long-term orbital evolution of stars and open and globular star clusters in the central ($R<4$ kpc) region of the Galaxy.

It is known that from the purely mathematical point of view, this is an extremely difficult problem. One of Leonhard Euler's duties during his first stay at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Saint Petersburg (1727-1741) was to help establishing maps of the Russian Empire. He worked on this project under the direction of the famous French geographer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, who was the head of the astronomy and geography departments of the Academy. The general map of the Russian Empire, together with several maps of its particular regions were published under Euler's direction in the so-called Russian Atlas in 1745. In his later memoir ``De proiectione geographica De Lisliana in mappa generali imperii russici usitata'', written in 1777, Euler developed the mathematical theory of the method used by Delisle on a heuristic basis, which he himself used for drawing the general map of the Russian Empire. This method usually carries now the name Delisle--Euler map. In a previous paper, the first two authors of the present paper compared the Delisle--Euler map with several other maps of the conical type, with respect to various mathematical distorsion properties. They showed that this map is the best one from all the points of view considered, when it is applied to the drawing of the Russian Empire. In the present paper, we compare the Euler--Delisle map with a map which was not considered in the paper mentioned, namely, the so-called Lambert conformal conical projection, applied to the same region of the Earth. We show that the latter is better in several respects than all the other maps considered in the previous paper, including the Delisle--Euler map."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of 3D geospatial point clouds is pivotal for remote sensing applications. However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training."

However, existing implementations fail to fully exploit the special structure of modern CPU architectures and tensor-product elements, causing their performance \"sweet spot\" to anomalously remain at the low order of $p \\approx 2$, which severely limits the potential of high-order methods. To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. Our multi-level optimization strategy includes replacing the original $O(p^6)$ generic algorithm with an efficient $O(p^4)$ one based on tensor factorization, exploiting Voigt symmetry to reduce redundant computations for the elasticity problem, and employing macro-kernel fusion to enhance data locality and break the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance \"sweet spot\" to the higher-order region of $p \\ge 6$. Compared to the MFEM baseline, the optimized core operator (kernel) achieves speedups of 7x to 83x, which translates to a 3.6x to 16.8x end-to-end performance improvement in the complete solution process. This paper provides a validated and efficient practical path for conducting large-scale, high-order elasticity simulations on mainstream CPU hardware."

Existing benchmarks typically employ position-agnostic relevance labels, conflating the challenge of processing long contexts with the bias against specific evidence locations. To address this challenge, we introduce PosIR (Position-Aware Information Retrieval), a comprehensive benchmark designed to diagnose position bias in diverse retrieval scenarios. PosIR comprises 310 datasets spanning 10 languages and 31 domains, constructed through a rigorous pipeline that ties relevance to precise reference spans, enabling the strict disentanglement of document length from information position. Extensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art embedding models reveal that: (1) Performance on PosIR in long-context settings correlates poorly with the MMTEB benchmark, exposing limitations in current short-text benchmarks; (2) Position bias is pervasive and intensifies with document length, with most models exhibiting primacy bias while certain models show unexpected recency bias; (3) Gradient-based saliency analysis further uncovers the distinct internal attention mechanisms driving these positional preferences. In summary, PosIR serves as a valuable diagnostic framework to foster the development of position-robust retrieval systems."

    "abstract": "Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise from ships contribute significantly to underwater sound pollution, posing risks to marine ecosystems. This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings."

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC."

However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively. BioMorphNet not only classifies tissue categories within WSIs accurately to support tumor localization, but also analyzes differential gene expression between tissue categories based on prediction confidence, contributing to the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers."

However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges."

We then consider a functional of the terminal marginal measure of the branching process, whose conditional value is solution to a Kolmogorov backward master equation.

Observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) of electrostatic waves suggest that electrostatic instabilities, including the ion-ion-acoustic instability (IIAI) frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, play an important role in plasma heating and particle acceleration. Aims. Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange. We then identify the characteristic IIAI signatures for the proton and electron distributions, and relate them to our previous knowledge of IIAI onset and energy exchange mechanisms. Results. Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations. This task is left for future missions, since the time scale over which IIAI signatures develop is too fast for the sampling rates of current missions."

In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate safe and stable task execution, confirming the framework's effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $Δ$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $Δ$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts."

While BBH mergers occurring inside active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks may interact with surrounding gas and generate observable optical flares. We test this scenario by quantifying the spatial and temporal correlation between BBH events in GWTC-4.0 and AGN flares identified from six years of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR23 data. Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage. Adopting a 200-day post-merger time window for potential counterparts, we infer $f_{\\rm flare} = 0.07_{-0.05}^{+0.25}$ (90\\% confidence level). This non-zero maximum-likelihood value is driven primarily by GW190412, for which a single flare candidate (J143041.67+355703.8) is consistent in both time and spatial position. Excluding GW190412 yields results consistent with no association and an upper limit of $f_{\\rm flare} < 0.17$ at 90\\% confidence level. The intrinsic properties of GW190412 and the characteristics of the candidate host AGN are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for the AGN-disk formation channel, motivating continued, targeted electromagnetic follow-up of well-localized and highly asymmetric BBH mergers in current and upcoming time-domain surveys."

We further introduce a two-stage training framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) cold-start on synthesized trajectories and RL with plan-oriented rewards to teach LLMs to master the **D$^2$Plan** paradigm.

Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding."

Mutual-visibility sets, originally introduced as a tool for studying information flow and structural restrictions in complex networks, have since gained increasing attention due to their theoretical significance and diverse applications. In this paper, a complete characterization of mutual-visibility sets in trees is presented. It is shown that a subset $S$ is a mutual-visibility set of $T$ if and only if it coincides with the set of leaves of the Steiner subtree $T\\langle S\\rangle$. As a consequence, the mutual-visibility number of a tree is equal to the number of its leaves. For trees containing branch vertices, the notion of legs is introduced and an explicit formula for the number of maximal mutual-visibility sets is derived in terms of the corresponding leg lengths. It is proved that every tree is absolute-clear. It is further established that the mutual-visibility number is preserved under the line graph operation for trees with at least two edges, that is, $μ(L(T))=μ(T)$."

    "abstract": "The sudden approximation is a fundamental tool for describing ultrafast quantum transitions, yet the relationship between the initial 3D wavefunction and the final kinetic energy release (KER) remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that the observed fragment energy distribution $P(E)$ following a sudden Coulomb explosion is a direct manifestation of the initial state's 3D radial geometry. By applying a Bohmian-inspired local energy framework to Slater-type orbitals, we identify a universal \\textbf{``0.5 Rule''}: for ground-state configurations, the ratio of the peak detected energy to the integrated average energy ($R_E = E_{peak}/\\langle E \\rangle$) is strictly bounded below 0.5. Our systematic parametric study reveals that this ratio is highly sensitive to the orbital exponent $ζ$ and the principal quantum number $n$. Specifically, $R_E$ decreases significantly as $ζ$ increases, suggesting that the kinetic energy of fragments from inner-shell orbitals is far more suppressed than that of valence electrons. We further show that for excited states ($n > 1$), the emergence of secondary high-energy peaks provides a theoretical explanation for the structured KER spectra observed in $H_2^+$ ionization experiments. Finally, we propose that this geometric energy shift offers a new perspective on the ``missing energy'' problem in particle physics. Our findings suggest that a detected energy peak lower than the statistical mean may be an intrinsic signature of 3D quantum-spatial distribution ($r^2|ψ|^2$) rather than proof of undetected particles. This work provides a rigorous framework for recalibrating experimental energy signals across atomic, molecular, and subatomic scales."

    "abstract": "In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage."

Within the Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC) framework, we derive a generalized coupled-channel optical theorem and show that the total absorption cross section, $σ_{\\mathrm A}\\propto -\\langleΨ|W|Ψ\\rangle$, decomposes as $σ_{\\mathrm A}=σ_{\\mathrm D}+σ_{\\mathrm B}+σ_{\\mathrm{int}}$, where $σ_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is a coherent interference term between channel components. For the systems and fragment-target optical potentials considered, $σ_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is negative and comparable in magnitude to the direct absorption terms. The off-diagonal imaginary couplings play a dual role, redistributing flux among channels and generating $σ_{\\mathrm{int}}$, which is required for flux-balance consistency. Calculations for $d+{}^{93}\\mathrm{Nb}$ and ${}^{6}\\mathrm{Li}+{}^{59}\\mathrm{Co}/{}^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}$ show that retaining the full non-diagonal coupling matrix substantially enhances breakup-channel absorption for heavy targets while reducing the total absorption through interference effects. Neglecting off-diagonal imaginary couplings therefore leads to a systematically biased physical picture, overestimating total absorption and severely underestimating breakup contributions, implying that experimental analyses based on incoherent-sum models inherit this bias. Full-coupling CDCC calculations are thus essential for consistent, mechanism-resolved extraction of absorption cross sections in weakly bound systems."

Existing approaches typically either rely on centralized planning under idealized communication, or run fully distributed local controllers with fixed communication patterns; they rarely couple communication scheduling with policy learning, and thus struggle when bandwidth is scarce or packets are frequently dropped. We address this joint control--communication problem and propose a hybrid centralized--distributed scheme: a centralized cloud policy sends small residual corrections only when selected, while a lightweight on-board Gated recurrent unit (GRU) policy provides a safe default fallback when wireless connection is not available."

Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance. Our work establishes the feasibility of gas emission-based livestock health monitoring, paving the way for practical, in vitro acidosis detection systems.

While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors. These unified signal tokens are then fed into a Transformer-based decoder, which employs an autoregressive mechanism to generate coherent action descriptions word-by-word. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, and WiFiTAD). Experimental results demonstrate that MobiDiary effectively generalizes across modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on captioning metrics (e.g., BLEU@4, CIDEr, RMC) and outperforming specialized baselines in continuous action understanding."

However, the sensitive use case of mental health demands thoughtful integration with mental health concepts and a comprehensive understanding of prior literature. This paper presents a scoping literature review of the ISMAR, IEEEVR, and TVCG communities to assess the contributions of the XR community to the mental health serious game domain and explore potential weaknesses and strengths for future work by XR researchers. To this end, this review identified 204 possibly relevant articles in the XR community and fully evaluated 6 XR serious games for mental health. This relatively small number of articles for final inclusion suggests that XR mental health serious games are largely underexplored by the XR community (or not reported within the XR community). There is value in exploring the existing literature space as it is. Thus, this paper evaluates these six papers in terms of game elements and underlying psychological foundations, and discuss future directions for XR researchers in this wide-open research space within our community."

In this work, we construct local and hybrid local-nonlocal chiral 3NFs for the newly established Idaho local position-space two-nucleon potential, and calculate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{132}$Sn. The two low-energy constants of 3NF are constrained by the ground-state energies of $^3$H and $^{16}$O, as suggested in a recent work.

To fill this gap, we introduce LogiSafetyGen, a framework that converts unstructured regulations into Linear Temporal Logic oracles and employs logic-guided fuzzing to synthesize valid, safety-critical traces. Building on this framework, we construct LogiSafetyBench, a benchmark comprising 240 human-verified tasks that require LLMs to generate Python programs that satisfy both functional objectives and latent compliance rules. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal that larger models, despite achieving better functional correctness, frequently prioritize task completion over safety, which results in non-compliant behavior."

Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\\sim13\\,\\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\\sim2\\,\\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability."

Given an image stream, our model identifies dynamic regions through motion cues with depth and camera pose priors, then matches static elements against its memory bank. When revisiting familiar locations, CogniMap3D retrieves stored scenes, relocates cameras, and updates memory with new observations. Evaluations on video depth estimation, camera pose reconstruction, and 3D mapping tasks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, while effectively supporting continuous scene understanding across extended sequences and multiple visits."

    "abstract": "In clinical trials, ensuring the quality and validity of data for downstream analysis and results is paramount, thus necessitating thorough data monitoring. This typically involves employing edit checks and manual queries during data collection. Edit checks consist of straightforward schemes programmed into relational databases, though they lack the capacity to assess data intelligently. In contrast, manual queries are initiated by data managers who manually scrutinize the collected data, identifying discrepancies needing clarification or correction. Manual queries pose significant challenges, particularly when dealing with large-scale data in late-phase clinical trials. Moreover, they are reactive rather than predictive, meaning they address issues after they arise rather than preemptively preventing errors. In this paper, we propose a joint model for multiple endpoints, focusing on primary and key secondary measures, using a Bayesian latent class approach. This model incorporates adjustments for risk monitoring factors, enabling proactive, $k$-step ahead, detection of conflicting or anomalous patterns within the data. Furthermore, we develop individualized dynamic predictions at consecutive time-points to identify potential anomalous values based on observed data. This analysis can be integrated into electronic data capture systems to provide objective alerts to stakeholders. We present simulation results and demonstrate effectiveness of this approach with real-world data."

Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor.

However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance."

Flavonoids averaged 45.3 target proteins per compound compared to 16.8 for FDA-approved drugs (2.7-fold higher; p=7.5x10^-4), reflecting multi-target architecture. Statistical analysis revealed that 71.4% of flavonoids targeted proteins associated with cardiovascular drugs and 78.6% aligned with antineoplastic drug targets. MTT-based Jurkat cell assays confirmed network predictions: high-association flavonoids (luteolin LC50=31.4 microM, myricetin=29.5 microM) produced strong cytotoxicity, while low-association flavonoids showed minimal activity (LC50>200 microM).

Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers are effective on rough terrains, such as cliffs and cave walls. However, such robots may fall over by misgrasping the surface or getting stuck owing to the loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments. To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains."

Even the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model shows limited capability in generating fluent, contextually appropriate Urdu text. We introduce Qalb, an Urdu language model developed through a two-stage approach: continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Starting from LLaMA 3.1 8B, we perform continued pre-training on a dataset of 1.97 billion tokens. This corpus comprises 1.84 billion tokens of diverse Urdu text-spanning news archives, classical and contemporary literature, government documents, and social media-combined with 140 million tokens of English Wikipedia data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We then fine-tune the resulting model on the Alif Urdu-instruct dataset. Through extensive evaluation on Urdu-specific benchmarks, Qalb demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a weighted average score of 90.34 and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Alif-1.0-Instruct model (87.1) by 3.24 points, while also surpassing the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model by 44.64 points.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods."

In $Ar$/$O_2$ discharges, the surface quenching coefficient of $O_2(a^{1}Δg)$ is known to affect this metastable density, which, in turn, affects the electronegativity and other important plasma characteristics. In this work, in addition to $O_2(a^{1}Δg)$, $O_2(b^{1}Σg^{+})$ and its associated reactions are incorporated into a global/equivalent circuit model of an $Ar$/$O_2$ discharge. By independently adjusting the quenching coefficients of both metastable species, changes of these surface coefficients are found to significantly affect the discharge characteristics, indicating that the role of $O_2(b^{1}Σg^{+})$ cannot be neglected. The effects of their respective surface quenching coefficients of these metastables based on various wall materials on the discharge are revealed including their effects on different particle species densities, plasma impedance, voltage drops across the sheaths, as well as plasma power absorption."

    "abstract": "The development of robust artificial intelligence models for histopathology diagnosis is severely constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated lesion data, particularly for rare pathologies and underrepresented disease subtypes. While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has driven broad advances across scientific and engineering domains. Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks."

Different from the mainstream routes based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbit torque, here we propose another mechanism coined as magnetoelectric torque to switch the magnetization in polar magnetic bilayers via pure electric field. In some magnetic van der Waals bilayers, when the electrostatic energy of polarization can compensate the interlayer magnetic coupling, a magnetoelectric torque is generated to fastly flip spins within a few picoseconds, which is demonstrated by combining the first-principles calculations, analytic model, as well as atomistic simulations. Such a magnetoelectric torque doesn't rely on the spin-orbit coupling and is generally active in polar magnetic homostructures and heterostructures. Our work provides an alternative route to switch magnetization in nanoscale, which may benefit the energy-saving and fast-response spintronic devices."

Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs. Using real Azure inference traces and detailed GPU profiling, our model balances serving latency and thermal constraints in AI datacenters while significantly improving AI datacenters' energy efficiency."

We do this by considering a Wigner's-friend scenario, where an observer (Wigner) can have quantum control over another observer (the friend). We present a thought experiment where the friend in superposition can receive a message written by a distinct copy of themselves in the multiverse, with the aid of Wigner. To maintain the unitarity of quantum theory, the observers must have no memory of the message that they sent. Our thought experiment challenges conventional wisdom regarding the ultimate limits of what is possible in an Everettian multiverse. It has a surprising potential application which involves using knowledge-creation paradoxes for testing Everettian quantum theory against single-world theories."

Electrical signals were recorded using an eight-channel star-shaped differential electrode array providing angular resolution around a central region of colonised substrate. We analyse spike statistics, bursting behaviour, inter-channel correlations, and event-based propagation delays. The results reveal strong directional heterogeneity in spiking frequency and amplitude, clustered bursting dynamics, partial and localised coupling between channels, and reproducible propagation patterns across spatial sectors. Electrical bursts originate preferentially in specific directions and recruit other regions with with characteristic delays ranging from seconds to minutes to hours. These findings support the interpretation of fungal mycelium as a spatially extended excitable medium capable of slow, distributed electrical signalling and signal integration."

Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \\texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment."

We apply this principle to two classes of random systems. First, we study random additive perturbations of a single billiard map associated with a strictly convex planar table on a surface of constant curvature. In this setting, we prove that the Lyapunov exponents vanish almost everywhere if and only if the billiard table is a geodesic disk.

Using these functions, we establish that if these networks have bounded invariant subspaces, then they must exhibit weak extinction within every such subspace. Also, for linear networks that are not weakly reversible, we show that every species outside a terminal strongly connected component undergoes strong extinction. Moreover, in order to further emphasize the difference between weak and strong extinction, we construct an example of a reaction system (based on the Ivanova network) that exhibits weak extinction for all the species, but does not exhibit strong extinction in any species."

While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs."

However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs."

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general. We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses."

Thus, we demonstrate that the $L^{\\infty}$ assumption is essential for the doubling of variables argument, and hence for the uniqueness of entropy solutions to scalar conservation laws. On the positive side, we develop a novel theory for scalar conservation laws with spatial heterogeneity by adapting the front tracking method. We recover uniqueness by imposing a Lax-type condition in addition to the entropy inequality, motivated by the properties of our front tracking approximations. Unbounded Kružkov solutions do not necessarily satisfy the weak formulation; we show that global weak solutions may not even exist in a natural class for some Cauchy problems of this form, even when Kružkov entropy solutions exist. Finally, we construct an explicit example of global ill-posedness with bounded initial datum."

    "abstract": "We develop and analyse an adaptive fully mixed finite element method for stationary generalized bioconvective flows, where the Navier--Stokes equations with concentration-dependent viscosity are coupled with a conservation law for swimming microorganisms. The formulation introduces auxiliary variables including the trace-free velocity gradient, a symmetric pseudo-stress tensor, the concentration gradient, and a semi-advective microorganism flux, which also allows for a consistent treatment of Robin-type boundary condition. The variational problem is posed within a Banach space framework and reformulated as a fixed-point operator. Existence of solutions follows from Schauder's theorem, while uniqueness is obtained under suitable data assumptions. The discrete problem is constructed using Raviart--Thomas finite element spaces together with piecewise polynomial approximations on macroelement-structured meshes, and existence of discrete solutions is established via Brouwer's theorem. An a priori error analysis yields optimal convergence rates. We further derive a residual-based a posteriori error estimator and prove its reliability using global inf-sup conditions, Helmholtz decompositions, and suitable projection operators, while efficiency is ensured through localization techniques and bubble functions. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions confirm the theoretical results, demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive refinement for singular solutions and complex geometries with inclusions, and illustrate the robustness of the method for a bioconvective benchmark with plume formation governed by an Einstein--Batchelor-type viscosity law."

    "abstract": "Derivative-free Riemannian optimization (DFRO) aims to minimize an objective function using only function evaluations, under the constraint that the decision variables lie on a Riemannian manifold. The rapid increase in problem dimensions over the years calls for computationally cheap DFRO algorithms, that is, algorithms requiring as few function evaluations and retractions as possible. We propose a novel DFRO method based on finite-difference gradient approximations that relies on an adaptive selection of the finite-difference accuracy and stepsize that is novel even in the Euclidean setting. When endowed with an intrinsic finite-difference scheme, that measures variations of the objective in tangent directions using retractions, our proposed method requires $O(dε^{-2})$ function evaluations and retractions to find an $ε$-critical point, where $d$ is the manifold dimension. We then propose a variant of our method when the search space is a Riemannian submanifold of an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. This variant relies on an extrinsic finite-difference scheme, approximating the Riemannian gradient directly in the embedding space, assuming that the objective function can be evaluated outside of the manifold. This approach leads to worst-case complexity bounds of $O(dε^{-2})$ function evaluations and $O(ε^{-2})$ retractions. We also present numerical results showing that the proposed methods achieve superior performance over existing derivative-free methods on various problems in both Euclidean and Riemannian settings."

To address these limitations, we introduce Agentic Context Evolution (ACE), a framework inspired by human metacognition that dynamically determines whether to seek new evidence or reason with existing knowledge. ACE employs a central orchestrator agent to make decisions strategically via majority voting.It aims to alternate between activating a retriever agent for external retrieval and a reasoner agent for internal analysis and refinement. By eliminating redundant retrieval steps, ACE maintains a concise and evolved context. Extensive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in accuracy while achieving efficient token consumption.Our work provides valuable insights into advancing context-evolved generation for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks."

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems."

Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines."

The underlying mechanism is made transparent by introducing a Krylov graph representation in which tensor products generate a higher-dimensional lattice whose diagonal shells encode operator growth and binomial path multiplicities. In the continuum limit, Krylov dynamics reduces to diffusion on this graph, with superadditivity arising from geometric broadening across shells. Explicit examples illustrate how deviations from synchronous evolution generate bounded, oscillatory excess complexity."

    "abstract": "The integration of thematic satellite allocations into core-satellite portfolio architectures is commonly approached using factor exposures, discretionary convictions, or backtested performance, with feasibility assessed primarily through liquidity screens or market-impact considerations. While such approaches may be appropriate at institutional scale, they are ill-suited to small portfolios and robustness-oriented allocation frameworks, where dominant constraints arise not from return predictability or trading capacity, but from fixed costs, irreversibility risk, and governance complexity. This paper develops a feasibility-first, non-predictive framework for satellite integration that is explicitly scale-aware. We formalize four nested feasibility layers (physical, economic, structural, and epistemic) that jointly determine whether a satellite allocation is admissible. Physical feasibility ensures implementability under concave market-impact laws; economic feasibility suppresses noise-dominated reallocations via cost-dominance threshold constraints; structural feasibility bounds satellite size through an explicit optionality budget defined by tolerable loss under thesis failure; and epistemic feasibility limits satellite breadth and dispersion through an entropy-based complexity budget. Within this hierarchy, structural optionality is identified as the primary design principle for thematic satellites, with the remaining layers acting as robustness lenses rather than optimization criteria. The framework yields closed-form feasibility bounds on satellite size, turnover, and breadth without reliance on return forecasts, factor premia, or backtested performance, providing a disciplined basis for integrating thematic satellites into small, robustness-oriented portfolios."

A signed-distance-based weighting further stabilizes least-squares learning on irregular geometries. Across eight benchmarks--including oscillatory ODEs, high-frequency Poisson equations, irregular-shaped domains, and stiff singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problems-the proposed method matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) variants while using only a single linear solve.

While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations.

Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power.

    "abstract": "Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems."

To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization."

We first show that such solitons cannot be entirely contained in the complement of a right rotational cone whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the translation direction. We then relax the growth condition on the (r-1)-mean curvature and prove that properly immersed translating solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to the translation direction. We conclude the paper by showing that complete, properly immersed translating solitons satisfying appropriate growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature cannot lie completely within the intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces."

We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

This formulation captures connected variants of Max Coverage, Partial Dominating Set, and Partial Vertex Cover studied in prior literature. After identifying (parameterized) inapproximability results inherited from known problems, we first show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable by $t$. Furthermore, when the bipartite graph excludes $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph, we design (resp. efficient) parameterized approximation schemes for approximating $t$ (resp. $k$). Notably, these FPT approximations do not impose any restrictions on $G_{conn}$.

    "abstract": "Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels."

    "abstract": "This work addresses an optimal control problem on a dynamics governed by a nonlinear differential equation with a bistable time-periodic nonlinearity. This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy. An application to the biocontrol of mosquito populations using Wolbachia-infected individuals illustrates the relevance of the theoretical results. Wolbachia is a bacterium that helps preventing the transmission of some viruses from mosquitoes to humans, making the optimization of Wolbachia propagation in a mosquito population a crucial issue."

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed."

Yet, this dimension has been largely underexplored in the VLM test-time prompt-tuning (TPT) literature, which has predominantly focused on improving their discriminative performance. Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches. Across a comprehensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that SoC consistently improves calibration performance, while also maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities."

    "abstract": "Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Their parameterization allows a straightforward quantile-based interpretation, which is particularly useful in regression modeling. Despite their potential, only a few specific distributions within this class have been explored in regression contexts, and zero-adjusted extensions have not yet been formally addressed in the literature. This paper formalizes the class of Box-Cox symmetric regression models and introduces a new zero-adjusted extension suitable for modeling data with a non-negligible proportion of observations equal to zero. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation, assess finite-sample performance through simulations, and develop diagnostic tools including residual analysis, local influence measures, and goodness-of-fit statistics. An empirical application on basic education expenditure illustrates the models' ability to capture complex patterns in zero-inflated and highly skewed nonnegative data. To support practical use, we developed the new BCSreg R package, which implements all proposed methods."

This framework is applied to the construction of a new mid infrared VIPA spectrometer, tested at wavelengths near 4.6 um with both continuous-wave and frequency-comb laser sources, with a resolving power predicted by analytical expressions to be as high as RP = 830 000 (corresponding to a resolution of 78 MHz). Validated numerical simulations, however, provided a more realistic estimate that captures limits set by all the optical components. By correcting aberrations and optimizing alignment, a resolving power of RP = 440 000 (150 MHz) was experimentally achieved, corresponding to 80% of the value predicted by numerical simulation of the entire spectrometer. These results bridge the gap between analytical design expressions and experimental results for compact, high-resolution VIPA spectrometers to enable more efficient fabrication and advanced design across critical areas like applied space optics, line-by-line pulse shaping, and broadband spectral sensors."

The broad fluorescence band of NV centers spectrally overlaps with the absorption of chlorophyll molecules, enabling FRET. As a result, depositing a chlorophyll layer on the diamond surface reduces the NV fluorescence lifetime from approximately 14 ns to below 4 ns, indicating efficient energy transfer. Laser-induced photobleaching of chlorophyll restores the unquenched NV lifetime. In contrast, NV centers located deeper within the diamond at depths of 40 nm and 72 nm remain unaffected, confirming that the observed quenching originates from a short-range FRET mechanism. The NV ensembles retain their optically detected magnetic resonance contrast while FRET is observed, demonstrating preservation of their spin properties. These proof-of-principle experiments establish the feasibility of combining FRET-based distance measurements with magnetic sensing using optically readable spins."

    "abstract": "Contemporary digital capitalism relies on the large-scale extraction and commodification of personal data. Far from revealing isolated attributes, such data increasingly exposes intersectional social identities formed by combinations of race, gender, disability and others. This process generates a structural privacy externality: while firms appropriate economic value through profiling, prediction, and personalization, individuals and social groups bear diffuse costs in the form of heightened social risk, discrimination, and vulnerability. This paper develops a formal political economic framework to internalize these externalities by linking data valuation to information-theoretic measures. We propose a pricing rule based on mutual information that assigns monetary value to the entropy reduction induced by individual data points over joint intersectional identity distributions. Interpreted as a Pigouvian-style surcharge on data extraction, this mechanism functions as an institutional constraint on the asymmetric accumulation of informational power. A key advantage of the approach is its model-agnostic character: the valuation rule operates independently of the statistical structure used to estimate intersectional attributes, whether parametric, nonparametric, or machine-learned, and can be approximated through discretization of joint distributions. We argue that regulators can calibrate this surcharge to reflect contested social values, thereby embedding normative judgments directly into market design. By formalizing the social cost of intersectional data extraction, the proposed mechanism offers both a corrective to market failure and a redistributive institutional shield for vulnerable groups under conditions of digital asymmetry."

The enhancement of optical properties at various resonances and the tunability of the hybridized modes are discussed. Importantly, our study reveals that despite the system being perfectly inversion-symmetric and achiral, it exhibits circular polarization anisotropy effects for non-zero finite azimuthal angles, manifested in the off-block-diagonal elements of the constructed Mueller matrices. The origin of this intriguing circular anisotropy effect is unravelled using the sequential linear birefringence and linear diattenuation effects arising from geometrical polarization transformation.

Our approach builds on an empirically established relation between helicity and trajectory linking, converting local counts of signed crossings $K$ into volumetric maps of dimensionless helicity, $H(\\mathbf{x})$. We demonstrate that the entanglement of particle trajectories, quantified by the mean signed crossing number, provides a robust proxy for helicity, not only at the global scale, but also locally in space and time. Our method can reveal local spatial heterogeneities in helicity and relate them to large-scale flow organization, enabling the reconstruction of spatially resolved chiral structures. Applied to von Kármán experiments and Taylor-Green direct numerical simulations, the method reveals iso-helicity surfaces and coherent chiral features, while time series of $K$ accurately track the evolution of domain-averaged helicity. The proportionality between $K$ and $H$ remains robust across different voxel geometries and different values of particle inertia, but is not held in laminar or time-modulated flows. This study shows that chirality tomography provides a practical helicity diagnostic in turbulent flows, while establishing a direct bridge between trajectory-level topology and a fundamental dynamical invariant of turbulence."

    "abstract": "In this prelinimary version of paper, we propose to give a complete solution to the Truncated Multidimensional Trigonometric Moment Problem (TMTMP) from a system and signal processing perspective. In mathematical TMTMPs, people care about whether a solution exists for a given sequence of multidimensional trigonometric moments. The solution can have the form of an atomic measure. However, for the TMTMPs in system and signal processing, a solution as an analytic rational function, of which the numerator and the denominator are positive polynomials, is desired for the ARMA modelling of a stochastic process, which is the so-called Multidimensional Rational Covariance Extension problem (RCEP) . In the literature, the feasible domain of the TMTMPs, where the spectral density is positive, is difficult to obtain given a specific choice of basis functions, which causes severe problems in the Multidimensional RCEP. In this paper, we propose a choice of basis functions, and a corresponding estimation scheme by convex optimization, for the TMTMPs, with which the trigonometric moments of the spectral estimate are exactly the sample moments. We propose an explicit condition for the convex optimization problem for guaranteeing the positiveness of the spectral estimation. The map from the parameters of the estimate to the trigonometric moments is proved to be a diffeomorphism, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of solution. The statistical properties of the proposed spectral density estimation scheme are comprehensively proved, including the consistency, (asymptotical) unbiasedness, convergence rate and efficiency under a mild assumption. This well-posed treatment is then applied to a system identification task, and the simulation results validate our proposed treatment for the TMTMP in system and signal processing."

    "abstract": "Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) provides a biologically-plausible learning mechanism for spiking neural networks (SNNs); however, Hebbian weight updates in architectures with recurrent connections suffer from pathological weight dynamics: unbounded growth, catastrophic forgetting, and loss of representational diversity. We propose a neuromorphic regularization scheme inspired by the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis: periodic offline phases during which external inputs are suppressed, synaptic weights undergo stochastic decay toward a homeostatic baseline, and spontaneous activity enables memory consolidation. We demonstrate that this sleep-wake cycle prevents weight saturation while preserving learned structure. Empirically, we find that low to intermediate sleep durations (10-20\\% of training) improve stability on MNIST-like benchmarks in our STDP-SNN model, without any data-specific hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, the same sleep intervention yields no measurable benefit for the surrogate-gradient spiking neural network (SG-SNN). Taken together, these results suggest that periodic, sleep-based renormalization may represent a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing local Hebbian learning in neuromorphic systems, while also indicating that special care is required when integrating such protocols with existing gradient-based optimization methods."

A light-like momentum ($k \\approx ω$) is relevant for the axion contribution to the effective number of light neutrinos, $ΔN^{ }_\\mathrm{eff}$, whereas a vanishing momentum ($k=0$) plays a role for warm natural inflation or ultralight dark matter, and has been employed in lattice estimates (both classical and quantum-statistical) of the strong sphaleron rate.

However, the multispectral and multi-resolution characteristics of multimodal satellite remote sensing data render traditional multimodal methods inapplicable. To reduce the data redundancy caused by the high-dimensional and complex multimodal vectors generated onboard while retaining key information and enhancing robustness against channel noise. We propose a Robust Multimodal Information Bottleneck (RMIB) framework which considers channel noise and communication bandwidth and introduces a new information bottleneck optimization objective. By applying this objective through end-to-end training, we optimize the feature extraction, fusion and encodes multimodal data into robust and effective feature vector in noisy communication environments by reducing redundancy and enhancing feature discrimination. To tackle the RMIB objective function, we derive a tractable variational upper bound using the Variational Information Bottleneck technique to overcome the computational intractability of mutual information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms baseline techniques in classification accuracy on three datasets but also enhances robustness against channel noise and reduces communication overhead."

Traditional instructional pedagogies and approaches are adept to bypass noticing learners' differences in researching knowledge comprehension, pacing, and motivational engagement levels. In this project we present an integrated, AI-enabled adaptive learning framework comparing predictive analytics with established cognitive theories for learning and engagement. The framework utilizes an ongoing, multimodal assessment of comprehension proxies, interactional reading traces, and prior knowledge schemata to continuously curate literary texts, Socratic questions or prompts, and structured scaffolding for individuals based on their evolving learner profiles. Based on a systematic literature review, a number of clear gaps persist in the field - name) under-contextualized pathways, rigid feedback loops, and disconnects from cognitive instructional principles. For the prototype, a concurrent mixed-methods design triangulated the statistical distillation outcomes to qualitative interview and annotation data acquired from a sample of secondary students. Compared to the controls we observed statistically significant levels of improvement in all areas investigated including comprehension test scores, selfdirected reading behaviours, and participatory equity. In tandem, teacher respondents noted a perceived decrease in instructional burden with enhanced assessment for learning, and again in equal measure a perception of greater curriculum entitlement. The results evidenced here spotlight an emergent capability for a hybrid AI framework to develop individualized, meaningful instructional conversations in literary studies, and we advocate for their systematic engagement into future curricular planning and pedagogical regulation."

Improper online interaction, including hate speech, cyberbullying, harassment, and threats, can be harmful not only for individuals but also to society in general. This study investigates the performance of various deep learning models in identifying online toxicity. We explore the capabilities of these models to accurately classify different types of toxic language, including its subtle forms and nuanced expressions. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) as chatbots in commercial applications, such as healthcare and customer service, introduces new challenges for toxicity detection. Despite LLMs’ potential to enhance efficiency and accessibility of chatbots, their susceptibility to generating inappropriate or harmful language can be easily exploited. This research specifically examines the dangers of toxicity resulting from trusting LLMs deployed as interactive agents in commercial settings."

In this study, eight natural dye sources—pineapple, pomegranate, red onion, sweet potato, red chili, watermelon, grapes, and tamarind—were investigated for DSSC fabrication. Multiple characterization techniques were employed during data preparation, but electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was selected for further analysis due to its ability to provide detailed information on charge transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance. To identify the most representative sample for synthetic data generation, Nyquist plots and ROC-SVM analysis were applied, leading to the selection of the red onion sample. A generative adversarial network (GAN) was trained using this optimal sample to produce synthetic EIS data. To improve the stability and reliability of the generated dataset, k nearest neighbor (kNN) post-processing was applied. The resulting GAN+kNN data closely matched the real measurements, with Rct showing a mean of 38.0 Ω (real = 37.5 Ω), which improved to 37.6 Ω after k-NN adjustment, while the standard deviation decreased from 0.8 to 0.3 Ω. Similar improvements were observed for Rs and Cdl. These results demonstrate that the GAN+kNN approach can generate reliable synthetic DSSC datasets, offering a practical tool for data augmentation and potentially reducing experimental workload in natural dye-based DSSC research."

These devices can continuously check important body signals such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level and ECG readings. By identifying this information the machine learning methods like Random Forest, SVM and Neural Networks can help to identify early symptoms of heart related diseases. But many existing systems mainly use fixed or general data and do not continuously observe the personal health. The proposed system solves this problem by using wearable devices and smart learning models to provide continuous and person specific risk identification for heart diseases. With real time tracking and data analysis the system mainly provides warnings at the correct time and clear information about a person's heart condition. This helps the users to take better care of their health and supports early medical help when it is required and also reduces long term healthcare problems. It also helps doctors to have a better understanding of the patient's heart problems so that they can follow better methods to cure the disease. As we know prevention is better than cure so this system helps in preventive healthcare and allows us to take an action before the serious condition is developed."

    "abstract": "As emerging distributed data-intensive applications impose ever-increasing capacity and performance requirements on modern extreme-scale computing environments, mitigating input/output (I/O) performance bottlenecks remains of utmost importance. A source of I/O contention in such environments is related to load imbalance on data servers of the parallel file system (PFS), usually employed as the back-end storage system under these conditions. This variance in data distribution can be particularly severe in applications with synchronous parallel I/O phases, in which each processes transfers data to an individual and independent file. Focusing on addressing this issue, this research work introduces the N-N Round-Robin (N2R2) data placement approach. With minimal information about the application workload and the configuration of the PFS, this heuristic approach can effectively distribute the load across data servers. Experimental results demonstrate N2R2 reduced, in average, 97% of the variance of the load on data servers, compared to traditional data placement approaches implemented in popular PFSs, in scenarios with up to 50,000 processes and data transfer of approximately 931 GiB."

Students have described these displays of emergent behavior as ‘magical’ and as generating fostering positive emotions. We hypothesize these emotions can help students develop a sense of community while supporting their ability to acquire technical skills in the lab. The programming of each robot affects the emergent behavior of the swarm, enabling a strong coupling between computational and emotional aspects of the learning experience. This preliminary paper outlines a short sequence of weekly lab sessions in which these robots will be introduced, forming part of a first-year engineering design and robotics course at the University of Michigan. A preliminary assessment scheme that draws from engineering education literature to analyze subjective data, with a particular focus on student interviews and reflections is also described. A pilot offering is planned for September 2025 with results to be presented at FIE in November. Conference participants will also have the opportunity to interact with a small firefly swarm and discuss how emotional elements might be helpful in other educational contexts."

In IIoT systems, many machines and equipment's are involved, where multi-parameter sensing is the major task.

To address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS state vector, maximizing the achievable rate.

While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of lip movement accuracy, expression variation, and style feature expressiveness."

    "abstract": "In dexterous manipulation, learning-based methods have achieved success while requiring extensive data and lacking interpretability, whereas model-based methods are interpretable but costly due to the nested optimization in model predictive control (MPC). Recently, based on simplified algorithms, explicit model methods have overcome some difficulties and achieved satisfactory performance. In this article, a simplified nonnegative least squares (NNLS)-based quadratic programming (QP) algorithm is utilized to obtain the approximation solution to the dual QP of the contact model, with a hyperparameterized solution to the NNLS formulation used. As a result, an explicit and interpretable ContactNNLS model is proposed, eliminating the need to solve the nested optimization. The ContactNNLS model delivers a more general form when compared with the existing explicit models. Besides, the ContactNNLS model is integrated into an MPC to approximate the time-stepping prediction, leading to a ContactNNLS-MPC algorithm for dexterous manipulation. The effectiveness of the ContactNNLS model and the ContactNNLS-MPC algorithm is verified in extensive simulated tasks. Moreover, the ContactNNLS-MPC is further applied to a real Allegro hand for on-palm reorientation tasks, demonstrating its practicality and feasibility."

To fill the research gap, we investigate the subjective video captioning (SVC) task in this paper, which aims to generate emotional captions by incorporating viewers’ personalized emotional reactions upon the EVC task. SVC is extremely challenging, which lies in two aspects: 1) the correlative emotion perception between subjective and objective emotions; and 2) the collaborative generation between emotional and factual information. To this end, we propose the Subjective-Objective Emotion-Correlated Generation Network (SO-ECGN) in this paper. Specifically, our SO-ECGN leverages the proposed dynamic mask attention and emotion domain shifting module to achieve the objective emotion incremental learning, and then, a subjective-objective emotions correlation module is proposed to adaptively combine two perspective emotions to provide accurate emotion guidance (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, emotional polarity and intensity) for each generation step. Furthermore, an emotion-correlated decoder is proposed to generate subjective captions by adaptively referring to factual information and emotional information. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach and each proposed module, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, reaching 79.2%, 45.1% on BLEU-1, CIDEr metrics on EmVidCap-L dataset."

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) aims to match person images of the same identity under different camera views. Conventional ReID models mainly consider a closed-world setting where person identities in query and gallery are exactly the same. However, in real-world applications, query identities and gallery identities usually do not exactly contain the same persons. Therefore, open-world ReID has been proposed to match the images of gallery identities (targets) with a large number of non-gallery identities ( non-targets). Since some non-targets are quite similar to the targets, the ReID model may make incorrect judgments when verifying these non-targets. To solve this problem, we leverage the impressive cross-modal matching capabilities of the large vision-language model (VLM) to construct <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</b>egative <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</b>emantic guided identity boundaries for each person to develop the open-world <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReID</b> model (NS-ReID). To construct the identity boundary, we propose Virtual Non-target Repulsion that utilizes negative semantics to prompt the ReID model to push virtual non-targets away from the targets. The prompts expressing negative semantics offer a different perspective to guide the training process to avoid contradictory optimization. Moreover, we propose the Dual-Boost Refinement Learning strategy to train learnable identity prompts to capture detailed identity information, which is essential for constructing the identity boundary since the variations among identities are comparatively small. These facilitate the model in constructing the wide identity boundary of each person. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ReID datasets demonstrate that our proposed NS-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods."

    "abstract": "This research category full paper describes an LLM assisted instruction integration with a virtual cybersecurity lab platform. The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is transforming today's workforce needs, increasing skill set gaps, especially for the older workforce. With an increasing emphasis on STEM skill sets like robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, the workforce will have to be re-skilled and up-skilled to meet future industry needs. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), has the potential to aid building of this workforce, by assisting trainee's by acting as instructional assistant, helping students build skill sets while performing experiential learning exercises. This paper presents a generative AI based instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential learning platform. This instructional assistant uses a zero-shot, optical character recognition (OCR) based Large Language Model (LLM) assisted Instruction pipeline integrated into the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform developed in 2015. The instructional agent assits the experiential learning by extracting the text from slide images using Tesseract OCR and to generate simplied instructions by prompting a general-purpose LLM enabling real-time instruction optimization with minimal infrastructure and integration effort. The instructional assistant was evaluated in a live university course and where in student feedback was collected using a 1-to-10 rating scale, with an average feedback score of 7.83 on 42 responses, indicating a strong perceived usefulness of the instructional assistant. In addition, we conducted a comparative study using multimodal LLMs that directly interpret slide images with the OCR pipeline, to analyze the computational overhead, and operational costs. While the multi-modal LLM pipeline performed better on slides with dense visual content, the OCR-LLM-based pipeline delivered comparable pedagogical value on text-centric slides with a significantly lower overhead, and operational costs. This work demonstrates that a lightweight and easily integrable pipeline can effectively bring modern generative AI capabilities into legacy platforms, offering a scalable enhancement for improving student comprehension in technical education settings."

    "abstract": "The computing revolution and the rise of modern artificial intelligence are rooted in the physics of semiconductor devices, where the field effect transistor (FET) emerged as the archetypal “tiny switch” enabling digital logic. This article commemorates the centennial of Lilienfeld’s pioneering conception of the field effect device, situating it as the intellectual and technological seed of the digital age. The narrative traces the continuum from Lilienfeld’s early vision and Alan Turing’s theoretical foundations of computation, through the invention of the transistor and the advent of transistorized computers. It examines the paradigm shift brought by integrated circuits (ICs), highlighting IBM’s System/360 and System/370 as milestones in architectural unification and silicon integration. The discussion then explores the realization of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) FET (MOSFET), the birth of the microprocessor, and the breakthroughs in complementary MOS (CMOS) technology that enabled high-density integration and ushered in the fourth generation of computers. Special attention is given to the challenges of MOSFET scaling, the emergence of multiple gate architectures such as FinFETs (fin FETs), and inventive extensions of planar devices including ultra-thin body FETs and buried halo MOSFETs. Finally, the article discusses how domain-specific architectures: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and other application-specific ICs have leveraged advanced FET technologies to drive the current era of intelligent machines. By weaving together historical milestones, device innovations, and architectural transformations, this article underscores how the physics of the transistor switch continues to shape the trajectory of computing and artificial intelligence."

The findings indicate a sharp rise in publications from 2023 onward aligns with the widespread adoption of generative AI tools in education. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that social sciences, computer science, and engineering fields dominate the publication landscape, with the majority of research being published in educational technology journals. The United States, Hong Kong, and China emerged as major contributors, though global collaboration remains uneven, particularly in Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Next, author keyword co-occurrence revealed eight thematic clusters linking AIL to ethics, education levels (K-12 and higher education), GenAI, digital literacies, and instructional design, while identifying underexplored areas such as early AI exposure and informal learning. Additionally, the textbased co-occurrence analysis of titles and abstracts further revealed four major themes: classroom AI integration, behavioral measurement, ethical considerations, and GenAI. However, despite rapid growth, gaps persist in methodological diversity, interdisciplinary participation (particularly in STEM and biomedical domains), and representation of marginalized communities. Hence, recommendations and implications are discussed to address these gaps and guide ongoing AIL research."

    "abstract": "Accurate differentiation of lung adenocarcinoma subtypes is critical for personalized surgical strategies, particularly in intraoperative differentiation between adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IA). However, tissue distortions such as alveolar rupture or collapse induced during surgery frequently lead to subtype misclassification. Conventional histological staining limited by their inability to quantitatively characterize collagen and elastin fibers, fail to address this clinical challenge. To overcome these limitations, we developed a quantitative Multiphoton Elastin-Collagen Imaging (qMECI) method, specifically targeting diagnostic ambiguities between AIS and IA. qMECI employs label-free multiphoton microscopy to simultaneously capture microarchitectural features of collagen and elastin fibers, extracting ten quantitative metrics encompassing fiber distribution patterns, spatial arrangement, and morphological parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that qMECI identifies critical discriminative signatures of extracellular matrix remodeling, including collagen-elastin coverage, hyperplastic reorganization, and vascular-aligned growth patterns. By integrating quantitative biomarkers such as relative fiber distribution and area ratios, qMECI enables objective differentiation of two diagnostically challenging scenarios: alveolar collapse-type AIS versus acinar-pattern IA and alveolar rupture-type AIS versus papillary IA. This method holds significant potential to refine intraoperative diagnosis workflows, thereby reducing misdiagnosis risks and overtreatment."

However, the algorithm will fail in the presence of the PM’s third harmonic. Hence, this article presents the eddy-current sensor-free control algorithm based on the two negative sequence coordinate transformation in parallel with different frequencies (TNSPDF). The random and disordered signal in the Hall output is modulated into asymmetrical component about the displacement vector angle through negative sequence coordinate transformation at different electrical frequencies, achieving decoupling between the displacement vector angle and the motor electrical frequency. The interference signal does not lead to any pulsation in the estimated displacement; rather, it evolves into a significant coefficient for the purpose of displacement identification. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified through experiments on a bearingless permanent magnet slice motor system."

However, the manual evaluation of fundus images by ophthalmologists continues to be the primary diagnostic approach, limited by the availability of human resources, particularly in rural or disadvantaged areas. This study introduces an automated multi-class classification system for eye diseases using a deep learning model based on the EfficientNetB3 architecture, supported by Grad-CAM visualization to improve model interpretability. The system was trained using the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset, which was categorized into five classes, including Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, Cataract, and Other Diseases, the which has been simplified to only contain Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Pre-processing includes Circular Border Cropping, RGB Channel Extraction, CLAHE, Median Filtering, resizing to $300 \\times 300$ pixels, and data augmentation. The model included pretrained ImageNet weights and was fine-tuned on the last $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ layers with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-6$ and a dropout rate of 0.3. The proposed model achieved a training accuracy of 97.08%, a validation accuracy of 87.20%, and a testing accuracy of 89.26%. These results indicate significant potential for medical application. The model can assist with triage or function as diagnostic tool in teleophthalmology and radiology processes. Future study may explore the application of other deep learning architectures and varied datasets to improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, combining additional imaging modalities beyond fundus images could expand the system’s application and improve diagnostic reliability."

    "abstract": "Voice phishing, or “vishing,” has emerged as one of the most deceptive and rapidly growing cyber threats in recent years. Exploiting the psychological trust associated with real-time voice communication, attackers often impersonate legitimate entities-such as banks, government agencies, or tech support-aiming to coerce individuals into revealing sensitive information including personal identification numbers, bank details, and login credentials. As vishing tactics grow more sophisticated through the use of AI-generated voices and spoofed caller IDs, traditional rule-based or static detection systems are proving inadequate. These legacy approaches typically lack real-time capabilities, suffer from high falsepositive rates, and struggle to adapt to evolving fraud patterns. This research proposes a comprehensive, AI-driven voice phishing detection system capable of analyzing calls in real time by leveraging a fusion of state-of-the-art technologies. The core architecture integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tools such as Whisper or Wav2Vec for live speech-to-text conversion, enabling immediate linguistic analysis. It employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using models like BERT to detect deceptive language patterns, urgency, and manipulative cues. Simultaneously, the system extracts acoustic features such as pitch, tone, speech rate, and vocal stress, which are often indicative of deceptive intent. These multimodal features are fed into a hybrid ensemble of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to classify the call as legitimate or suspicious. A real-time web-based interface allows for live monitoring of conversations between two entities, while dynamically updating the phishing probability score based on ongoing interactions. The system further enhances user trust by offering explainable AI outputs, providing reasons behind each classification decision. Evaluation on a curated dataset demonstrates a detection accuracy exceeding 98 %, with strong performance metrics across precision, recall, and latency. The system is scalable, user-friendly, and well-suited for integration into modern communication infrastructures including VoIP services."

Although 3D printing technology has the advantages of rapid production, high customization and excellent fit, it still faces challenges such as insufficient material durability, high technical threshold for professional software processing and modeling, and clinical research is mainly limited to the ability to walk in a straight line, and lacks systematic evaluation of dynamic functions such as standing, turning and walking. In this study, TPU combined 3D scanning and desktop 3D printing technology to create a personalized AFO, and designed a nine-week, three-times-a-week rehabilitation training program for clinical validation in 20 stroke patients. The evaluation indicators included 3-metre walking speed, the BBS, and TUG. The results showed that the average walking speed of the patients increased to 0.79 m/s, the gait cycle was shortened to 9.8 seconds, the BBS score was consistent with 90.45%, and the TUG test performance was significantly improved during the withdrawal period (Z=2.64, p < 0.01). The results of this study show that 3D printed AFO has certain potential in improving the gait and balance function of stroke patients, making up for the shortcomings of AFO material strength, time-consuming modeling, and dynamic multi-stage mobility ability assessment, and providing a reference for clinical application."

    "abstract": "In China, fresh agricultural products are in large consumption as compared with other countries, according to authorized research data, such products consumption proportion is $\\mathbf{2 3} \\% \\boldsymbol{-} \\mathbf{3 0} \\%$, but in USA and Japan the proportion is under 5%. And these products during supply chain processes are often in normal temperature but with characters of perishability, store difficulty and other special characters. Usually, Agriculture Trade Markets are the mid-suppliers of these products, so there are more supply chain risks for them. This study firstly investigated Wuhan Agriculture Trade Markets with questionnaire and on-site visit method, gathering true data, and found that risk factors include information, distribution, procurement, environment, and then split the four factors into ten factors and used AHP method to analyze weights of these factors. After that different risks were evaluated according to the weights, and suggestions were provided to lower the risks. Finally, a conclusion is made to summarize the article, which provides certain reference for other similar enterprises in fresh agricultural products supply chains."

    "abstract": "The issue of recovering distributed regression from local noisy measurements collected through a sensor network operating in data fusion mode is analyzed. The proposed solution integrates regularized kernel machine learning on aggregated data with semi-supervised learning on the original set of sensor measurements, aiming to reduce model complexity and smooth the recovered dependencies. The data aggregation technique relies on regularized clustering of the entire set of sensors, considering the distances between them while minimizing local measurement variation within a cluster by incorporating a regularizer as an appropriate penalty function. Additional smoothing is achieved by adjusting the kernel function to reflect the geometric structure of the sensor network."

    "abstract": "Polio is a significant public health issue in Balochistan, Pakistan, because the immunization rates are very low, the area is afflicted with sociopolitical unrest, and the people are misinformed. In this paper, the authors take advantage of Apache Spark, which is a scalable engine of big data analytics, to process a large amount of polio vaccination data in nine campaigns in Quetta, Killa Abdullah, and Pishin, where the risk is high. The analysis is aimed at finding the relationship between missed and rejected cases, drivers of refusals, and relating the vaccination coverage to Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) cases. The results indicate that the primary reasons for refusals are misconceptions and religious beliefs, the greatest of which were registered in Quetta. The analysis based on correlation analysis, , and K-means proves the presence of significant correlations between missed vaccinations and refusals and shows areas that are inclined to use specific interventions. This study (contrary to previous research) is based on Apache Spark as a tool of processing real-time big data as opposed to the use of static tools (WEKA or SPSS). The findings indicate that Apache Spark can be used in the real-time detection of anomalies and monitor campaigns to create insight that can be used to make informed policy decisions to enhance immunization efforts in underserved communities."

MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox was used to image and process 974 rice grains, including Sinandomeng and Jasmine varieties. Key features like area, major axis length, minor axis length, equivalent diameter, and perimeter were extracted using grayscale conversion, Canny edge detection, and morphological operations. Three neural architectures—Shallow DNN, Simulated TabNet, and Simulated NODE—were trained in Python using the standardized extracted data. With less training time and a smaller model size than the others, the Simulated NODE performed the best, with 92.82% accuracy, 93.53% precision, and 92.82% recall. These results show how lightweight neural networks may be used to identify rice varieties in real-time, scalable, and economically. This makes them a viable substitute for laboratory-based techniques and advances automated agricultural quality assurance systems."

The hybrid model improves multiscale feature extraction and classification performance by leveraging EfficientNetV2-B3's compound scaling and NASNetMobile's neural architecture search capability. The dataset, which consisted of tagged citrus leaf images, was divided into training and validation sets, with model performance measured across 30 epochs. According to the experimental data, the suggested model attained a 95% classification accuracy while displaying consistent convergence and little overfitting throughout the training phase. While traditional deep learning models may generate somewhat superior accuracy, the hybrid approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable alternative ideal for real-time agricultural environments with restricted processing resources. The results show that the integration of EfficientNetV2-B3 with NASNetMobile successfully balances performance, interpretability, and hardware feasibility."

    "abstract": "In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) and CubeSat nanosatellites, compact and high-performance printed antennas are essential to ensure reliable and efficient wireless communications. Compact, lightweight, and easy to integrate into the limited space of CubeSats, this antenna requires careful optimization to achieve high radiation efficiency, stable polarization, and sufficient bandwidth, while meeting the miniaturization and electromagnetic compatibility requirements of the space environment.As part of our research, we propose a new miniaturized patch antenna architecture, specifically designed for single-unit CubeSat platforms for IoT satellite applications. By combining innovative geometry, geometric phase shifting techniques, and a precisely centered feed, our design significantly improves polarization stability, usable bandwidth, and antenna gain. Furthermore, the use of space-grade substrates ensures better resistance to dielectric losses, improved radiation efficiency, and optimal mechanical compatibility with the structural and environmental constraints of CubeSat missions.We present the design and analysis of a double-aperture rectangular U-shaped patch antenna optimized for the 7.5 GHz X-band operating frequency. The antenna is fabricated on a 1.6 mm thick FR-4 substrate (ε<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</inf> = 4.4) using a microstrip feed configuration. Simulation results obtained from HFSS indicate excellent impedance matching, with a reflection coefficient S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</inf> lower than −30 dB. The antenna achieves a gain higher than 12 dBi and exhibits a directional radiation pattern, making it well-suited for space-based or long-range wireless communication applications.These performances demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed structure for embedded systems that require compactness, high efficiency, and ease of fabrication. Furthermore, the design enhances radiation efficiency and ensures mechanical compatibility with the structural and environmental constraints typically associated with CubeSat missions."

The proposed design integrates the unpredictability of QCM with some nonlinear post-processing stages, such as a state initialization stage using SHA256 and the utilization of a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to produce a 256-bit keystream block. The initialization process is followed by a warm-up phase to reduce the correlation between the seed and the output. The entire extensive testing process showed that the generated keystream is able to pass all categories in the NIST Statistical Test Suite (NIST STS) for data as large as 1 billion bits. The keystream also passed the Dieharder Test. Additionally, this algorithm achieves near-ideal values in several key metrics, such as an avalanche effect of $49.9737 \\%$, a correlation coefficient of 0.00015, a linear complexity ratio of 0.5000, and excellent throughput speed. Based on the test results that showed a good behavior of the proposed stream cipher as a random function, this algorithm has the potential to be used as a secure cryptographic symmetric system."

This research proposes a laptop recommendation system that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning methodologies to address this issue. Specifically, the system employs FastText word embeddings to transform natural-language user inputs into vector representations, which are subsequently processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict matching laptop profiles. The training dataset comprises detailed laptop specifications, along with \"Suitable For\" labels indicating different user categories. After preprocessing and embedding, the model is optimized using a cosine similarity-based loss function. Recommendations are generated by computing the cosine similarity between the inferred user vector and the precomputed laptop vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model attains an average Mean Cosine Similarity of 0.9396, indicating high accuracy in relevance matching. Furthermore, the system exhibits strong generalization capabilities when confronted with heterogeneous input types, including code-mixed language queries and minor typographical errors, thereby enhancing its applicability in real-world scenarios."

Over time, the course delivery evolved into a hyflex model and has since returned to a fully face-to-face. These three distinct interaction modalities provide a unique opportunity to examine how the mode of interaction influences students' teaming experiences. Specifically, this study addresses the following research questions: Do students evaluate their peers differently depending on whether their teams collaborate in a face-to-face, virtual, or hyflex mode?"

Traditional identification methods typically rely on proactive, one-time authentication, rendering them susceptible to common security threats and inadequate for providing continuous protection after login. Furthermore, existing user identification solutions for VR/AR head-mounted displays (HMDs) often compromise user convenience or require additional hardware, increasing cost and complexity. Although significant research has explored biometric-based identification in VR/AR, many proposed methods face practical challenges: they often depend on extensive sensor data or demand intrusive user interactions, limiting their suitability for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a lightweight and practical biometric user identification algorithm that utilizes only head movement patterns—eliminating the need for auxiliary sensors such as external cameras or controller-based inputs, and imposing no extra tasks on the user. Our approach is platform-independent and can generalize to new tasks without retraining. We validate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on multiple public datasets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves high identification accuracy with minimal data and computational overhead, making it a scalable and viable solution for continuous user identification in next-generation AR/VR applications."

The proposed study features an efficient framework which identifies, tracks and interprets the emotion aspects of facial expressions of students in classroom activities based on effective computer vision applications. The whole system is performed in three main steps: Facial detection and tracking, emotion typing and emotion data display. A Centroid Tracker is used in face tracking to detect and track individual students in real time, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) which was trained using the FER2013 dataset which has seven emotions which this system can recognize facial expressions. This affective response is then graphically represented to teachers giving them an idea of attentiveness of students and mood. Moreover, OpenCV deep learning module can also be used to integrate with variety of pre-trained models, which boosts the accuracy of recognition in the live environment. Real time feedback helps teachers to constantly adapt the method of their instruction to either sustain or upsurge the level of interest among the students. The accuracy and relevance of the classical is validated on experimental basis by use of live webcam feed, tests of the multiplicity of images. More than realizing a better understanding of classroom dynamics, this emotion-conscious strategy will establish the basis of intelligent, responsive educational environments served by the deployments of affective computing and artificial intelligence (AI).

Computer metrics like mean absolute error, root mean square error, and area under the curve indicate real-time system performance, growth, and stability. Integrating forecasting helps people make smarter, more proactive decisions by projecting brand opinion trends and potential issues. The suggested method scales, predicts, and simplifies dynamic mood analysis.

Survey data were collected from 311 mall visitors, capturing behavioral responses across advertising related indicators. A Random Forest (RF) classification model was used to identify the most influential predictors, achieving an accuracy of 89.39%, and revealed that ad noticing frequency, ad exposure before purchase, and brand familiarity were the strongest predictors of consumer influence. These results align with theories such as familiarity heuristics and show how repeated ad exposure and brand recognition shape consumer responses. To contextualize model performance, a Decision Tree (DT) classifier was also evaluated as a baseline with 86.82% of accuracy. The findings confirm that mall advertisements play a meaningful role in shaping consumer behaviors and that RF models offer valuable insights for predicting advertisement effectiveness."

Refinement of embedded contexts is achieved by the method by the incorporation of attention to oneself converters, which guarantees extremely precise and individualised suggestions. Complete evaluations conducted on comparable datasets have shown that the suggested system surpasses both the cooperative filtering along with deep learning-based models up to 85% for suggestions that are already in use. Comparing our strategy to the benchmark approaches, we can get a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$15-25 \\%$</tex> gain in Mean Reciprocity Rank (MRR) and Normalised Discounts Continuous Gain (NDCG). It has been shown via the findings that the client interaction structure that has been suggested considerably improves the reliability of actual time recommendations, resulting in a perfect candidate for adaptable content distribution."

    "abstract": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides a flexible mechanism for deploying Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) within Service Function Chains (SFCs), thereby streamlining data transfers between end-users and edge/cloud resources. The distinct requirements for forward and backward traffic—each carrying different types of content—give rise to Hybrid SFCs (HSFCs), which must be carefully designed to address unique deployment and performance concerns. However, achieving robust disaster resilience in HSFC-based NFV environments poses significant challenges, as natural or hardware-induced disruptions within Disaster Zones (DZs) can degrade service quality or even cause outages. This paper describes the Resilient Hybrid Service Function Chain Resource Optimization (R-HSFC-RO) approach to ensure both efficient resource utilization and sustained service delivery under disaster conditions. Our model considers bandwidth consumption, computational resource allocation for VNF execution, VNF instantiation overheads, and end-to-end latency requirements. For resolution, we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and Constraint Programming (CP), thereby enabling optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that R-HSFC-RO reduces total costs by up to 50%, enhances disaster resilience, and maintains high operational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Applications in the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) add an additional layer of complexity over traditional robotics, namely, networking and communication with the edge and the cloud. The field of cloud robotics has already revolutionized robotic systems, among others, by offloading computationally intensive tasks to the cloud. However, existing approaches are not necessarily suitable for real-time communication and distributed computing, and are not natively supported by widespread robotic middlewares such as ROS 2. Traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have been widely adopted for secure communication, but often introduce complexity in the setup and latency that can hinder real-time performance. Zenoh, an emerging data-centric networking framework, offers an alternative with low-latency, efficient data dissemination optimized for edge-to-cloud scenarios. Zenoh also integrates seamlessly with ROS 2, enabling lower overhead communication. This paper presents a comparative study of VPN and Zenoh in edge-cloud robotics, focusing mainly on communication latency, data throughput, and fault tolerance within a real-world robotic use case. Through experimental analysis, we highlight the strengths and limitations of both approaches and provide insight into their suitability for distributed robotic applications. The findings contribute to understanding the trade-offs between security, latency, and scalability in networking solutions for the IoRT."

The proposed research presents a new classification system in combination between WOA (Whale Optimization Algorithm) and SA (Simulated Annealing) to select features better in 3D CT liver images. To start with, 73 texture features in high dimensionality were achieved including GLCM, GLGCM, GLCCM, Tamura, and neighborhood difference matrices. The suggested WOA-SA hybrid was useful in the aspect of reducing dimensionality since it closed the redundant features to a smaller optimum of 25 features and was still diagnostic. This was followed by the classification of these features which used an ensemble design of multiclass SVM, k-NN, and Random Forests with the strength of weighted majority voting. Experimental testing on a balanced clinical data set proved to achieve high classification results of 97.8 percent accuracy and sensitivity and specificity of 95.1 and 94.4 respectively on the five liver conditions. Such findings performed far better than individual classifiers and current techniques, which proves the stability and the diagnostic possibilities of the hybrid approach to CLD classification development."

    "abstract": "This study offers a safe and smart blockchain solution which fits the needs of IoT devices with little power. Given how quickly IoT networks are growing, it has become necessary to guarantee that transactions can be verified securely, fast and without limits. Traditional blockchain technologies are secure but still need a lot of processing power and can deliver slow transaction validation. So, we recommend a new verification process that uses a random number generator together with the Keccak-256 cryptographic hash. This method greatly lowers the computing burden that is usual when using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. Transactions in the protocol are verified using a combination of hash results and random numbers, making the system safe and efficient, without help from any central entity. Evaluations of the proposed system reveal that it handles verification and execution faster than both the Bitcoin network and the EPBC network. Its ability to create strong avalanches and the lower expense of computing make the Keccak-256 algorithm perfect for lightweight, decentralized IoT solutions. This study increases the scalability and efficiency of the Internet of Things using blockchain technology."

    "abstract": "The UAVs are making a temporary connection to their neighbours in FANET. The UAVs can roam around freely in a certain area to sense their neighbours for sending data. Sending data through the sender required an enough energy and batteries cannot be used to get this energy back or replace it. UAVs have limited battery or energy power, so nodes and the network need to use their power efficiently to last longer. The primary problem with UAVs in Flying hoc Network (FANET) is that they don't have enough energy. Single UAV can store valuable information but successfully transfer of data to other UAVs is not easy task in FANET. In general, a UAVs in a FANET has trouble staying connected since the worth of the channels changes and the battery life is short. So, to control the communications well, we need an efficient algorithm. This novel research presents an innovative multi-path routing strategy designed to enhance energy efficiency and strong connection establishment. This approach always picks the UAVs in the cluster that have the high 100382energy among all of their neighbours, but it puts a higher focus on nodes that don't move around often. Here, the intermediary nodes are using up their energy by accepting and sending data. The proposed strategy uses the energy and movement of UAVs. The sender UAVs got a response to each request and chose the node with the most energy to deliver the data. The new energy-efficient technique makes the network work better than regular shortest-path routing. Performance measurements like routing overhead, throughput, and delay are used to measure how well the routing works."

This paper pioneers the application of LLMs’ outstanding knowledge and reasoning abilities to the challenging task of Traffic Matrix (TM) imputation. However, the application poses significant challenges due to the skewed TM distribution and the deficient traffic feature under low sampling rate. To address these issues, we propose TM-LLM, the first LLM-based model specifically designed for TM imputation. Our approach includes two critical designs: Firstly, we develop an adversarial training strategy to pre-impute TM data, allowing the LLM to understand the distributional features even when faced with extensive missing data. Secondly, we devise a TM-specific embedding scheme along with a crafted prompt template, which enables our approach to harness LLMs’ exceptional inferential ability. Experimental results show that TMLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods, achieves a notable 16.5% -44.8 % improvement in accuracy over the current best baseline, while reduces measurement costs by 80 % - 96 %. It can accurately capture the traffic pattern even when the sampling rate is extremely low.

As AI systems increasingly demonstrate advanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, code generation, and automated reporting, ensuring that student work genuinely reflects individual effort is paramount. The PROTECT framework, rooted in experiential learning and authentic assessment literature, embeds seven interconnected pillars to ensure authentic student engagement and learning. Personalization tailors project to individual student contexts; Realism incorporates real-world complexities to expose AI's limitations; Originality mandates multimodal deliverables beyond text; Taxonomy (Guided Progression) structures projects to advance through increasing cognitive complexity; Evaluation Diversity employs varied assessment modalities like oral defenses; Constraints establish clear boundaries for appropriate AI use; and Transparency requires students to document and disclose their AI tool usage. This comprehensive approach addresses AI's current limitations, such as its lack of technical depth, multimodality output, or creative problem-solving. Pilot implementations of PROTECT in engineering courses have shown promising results, including increased pass rates, improved student performance, and a significant reduction in AI misuse, with only one AI-generated submission attempt observed among approximately 230 assessments. This framework offers actionable strategies for integrating robust assessment practices into PBL, balancing AI integration with authentic, student-centered learning outcomes. Future work will extend PROTECT across diverse engineering domains, refining evaluation mechanisms and exploring scalable models to mitigate AI misuse."

While such international research programs are designed to broaden students' perspectives and develop global competencies, the reintegration process is often overlooked—potentially limiting students' ability to translate these experiences into long-term academic and professional growth. Grounded in theories of crosscultural adaptation and transformative learning, this study explores how students reconcile newly acquired knowledge, research methodologies, and collaborative practices with the academic expectations and institutional norms of their home universities. It focuses on how NSF IRSC participants navigate their return to domestic academic environments, particularly in adapting to differing research cultures, collaboration styles, and institutional structures. Preliminary results from studying the first two cohorts out of three are presented in this work. Findings will inform the development of targeted reentry support strategies to enhance the integration of international research experiences into students' academic trajectories."

This study proposes an automated DR classification system using the EfficientNetB3 deep learning architecture, combined with Grad-CAM visualization to enhance model interpretability. The system was trained using fundus images from the APTOS 2019 and IDRiD datasets, and further evaluated on an external test set from Undaan Eye Hospital, Indonesia. Prior to training, preprocessing steps including cropping, resizing, and color and contrast normalization were applied to standardize input images, while data augmentation was used to address class imbalance. A two-stage transfer learning strategy was implemented: an initial phase using ImageNet pre-trained weights followed by fine-tuning on DRspecific data. The final model achieved an accuracy of 88.32%, and Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrated that the model consistently focused on clinically relevant retinal regions. These results suggest that the proposed method provides reliable and interpretable DR classification, with strong potential for realworld clinical application."

Therefore, this study introduces a customized ruling line removal algorithm based on the Red-Green-Blue-Black (RGBB) method. The algorithm analyzes the black and RGB channel pixel intensities, which enhances image processing and complement operations and morphology, followed by reconstructing missing pixels where letters overlap with ruling lines. The resulting structural similarity index is high, with an average score of 0.89 on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The proposed method holds technical significance as it enhances the processing and extraction of features from handwriting."

    "abstract": "Novelty detection focuses on identifying new, unusual, or outlier observations that deviate significantly from the target class. The detection process in some cases is challenging due to the presence of unimportant features in the dataset. Hence, there is a necessity to eliminate the insignificant features in the dataset to improve the novelty data points detection. This paper proposes a novelty detection framework that combines One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), empowered by Random Forest (RF) feature importance. In this work, the RFE-RF selects the four most significant features from each training set, reducing its dimensionality prior to the novelty detection modeling using an OCSVM. Hyperparameters for the OCSVM classifier are optimized via a 5-fold cross-validation technique. Experiments on five publicly available benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm improves overall detection accuracy compared to transformation-based feature reduction techniques. Based on the results, the proposed algorithm outperforms other approaches in the accuracy of the classification, registering at an average of 75% while producing a more balanced trade-off between the classification of the target data points and the detection of the novelty or outlier data points."

Conventional irrigation practices are often wasteful of water and are not adaptive to climate change. This study addresses this problem by proposing a deep learning-based rainfall prediction model for irrigation schedule optimization. The method used is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm trained using historical climatological data (temperature, humidity, sunshine duration) from the Open-Meteo platform. The main contribution of this study is the development of an accurate prediction model and its application in an intelligent irrigation recommendation system. Evaluation results show that the LSTM model achieves excellent performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value of 4.15 mm on test data. Recommendation system simulations also show the potential for significant improvements in water use efficiency compared to fixed scheduling methods. This study proves that the application of LSTM can be an effective solution to support precision agriculture and climate risk mitigation in the Indonesian agricultural sector."

    "abstract": "Edge computing plays vital role in healthcare also enables data processing at real time, helps to reduce latency and enhances decision-making with clinical perspective. In case ophthalmology, where early detection of diseases like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration helps to prevent vision loss. Traditional methods hold few limitations like latency, bandwidth. Edge computing resolves these challenges to overcome in disease detection. Edge devices which are AI enabled improves the outcomes by real time data analysis. The combination of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) helps in enhancing care, also these aids are more supportive in training and patient awareness about the diseases, particularly AR is useful in the diagnosis and surgery. This blending of AR and VR creates a powerful ecosystem for managing not only the retinal diseases but also helpful while working with other issues in healthcare domain. The EdgeEnabled Retina Disease Detection Algorithm utilizes deep learning models to deliver 96% accuracy with minimum processing time of just 1 second. However, hardware limitations and cybersecurity risks challenge are to be considered and accordingly future developments has to be made to improve better connectivity and real time analysis of data can be made. To reduce the blindness and to improve ophthalmic care edge computing will definitely become a hope as an advanced technology."

    "abstract": "Soft actuators are safer than rigid robots for hand rehabilitation, yet their performance can be significantly affected by interactions that occur on multi-joint systems. Actuator–finger and actuator–actuator interactions can impact bending output and make actuator performance dependent on the actuation pattern. To address this, we developed and validated a finite element model of a three-joint modular actuator system attached to a dummy finger. The simulation revealed that the displacement between actuators, and the contact area between the fingers and the actuators are key factors influencing actuator performance. We proposed a novel attachment method to enhance contact area and reduce actuator displacement and compared it against five existing designs across two actuator types and three actuation patterns. Our results demonstrate improved bending and reduced dependence of actuator performance on actuation pattern. This study makes a dual contribution to the area of soft robotics for hand rehabilitation by proposing a novel FEM framework for modeling soft actuators attached to multi-joint systems as well as providing insights on attachment method design for soft actuators in hand rehabilitation, emphasizing the importance of actuator-actuator and actuator–finger interactions."

    "abstract": "Gesture recognition has become an important enabler to a human-robot interaction (HRI) that is intuitive and contactless. However, the traditional vision-based methods are usually constrained by changes in lighting, occlusion, privacy considerations, and the high computational requirements. In order to overcome these difficulties, the paper suggests a real-time, privacy-aware gesture recognition system based on mmwave radar sensing and lightweight CNN + temporal attention deep learning system. The offered system includes a hierarchical pipeline that includes mmWave radar signal acquisition, signal clutter removal and range-Doppler processing, temporal-spatial features encoding, and attention-based classification based on confidence fusion. The framework attains a total accuracy of 96.5 across six classes of gestures and end-to-end latency of less than 50 ms, which means that the control of a robot can be done easily and in a responsive manner. The great robustness is proved by experimental tests on 25 subjects in different environmental conditions, where the AUC values reach over 0.95 in all classes of gestures. Through comparison analysis, the suggested model proves to be better than the baseline CNN, BiLSTM and 3D-CNN models without sacrificing the computational complexity rendering it best suited to be deployed on the edges. The findings show the promise of mmWave radar sensing as a versatile alternative to vision-based HRI in providing real-time gesture-based HRI. The future research will delve into multi-user interaction, increased rank of gestures, and adaptive learning to be implemented more widely."

    "abstract": "The advancement of digital technologies is radically transforming the ways in which historical and architectural heritage is studied, preserved and passed on to future generations. This work proposes an integrated methodology for the digital reconstruction and management of historical monuments, based on the integrated use of Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM), Digital Twin (DT), IoT sensors and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Through the creation of high-fidelity digital models, updated in real time through environmental monitoring systems, it is possible to obtain a dynamic and predictive vision of the state of health of historical structures. The case study of the Leproso Bridge in Benevento, constitutes a concrete example of the application of this methodology: starting from surveys performed with terrestrial laser scanners and drone photogrammetry, an HBIM model was generated and subsequently integrated with data from environmental sensors, to develop a functional DT for the simulation of evolutionary scenarios, both historical and future. This digital platform makes it possible to visualise the transformations undergone by the artefact over time, monitor its current state, and predict structural degradation phenomena through automated analyses. In addition to its contribution in terms of conservation, the proposed approach represents an innovative educational resource. Students and teachers are involved in immersive, interdisciplinary learning experiences that combine art history, structural engineering, digital modelling and materials science. The interactive and data-driven environment fosters the development of transversal skills such as critical thinking, collaboration between disciplines and the conscious use of technology in heritage conservation. In conclusion, the combination of HBIM, DT, IoT and AI emerges as a powerful tool for both research and conservation design, as well as for historical memory education in a sustainable and participatory perspective"

We deployed a cross-year mentorship project for software engineering using introductory (level 2) and advanced software engineering (level 3) courses. All students in the advanced level 3 course had previously experienced the introductory level 2 course and would have insight into the expectations for the deliverables of the introductory software development project. The introductory course group project is an authentic assessment that focuses on designing and prototyping a software solution to address societal needs. They must adhere to software development lifecycle protocols as a team and deliver a prototype product, along with complete documentation, by the end of the semester. The advanced course student groups are assigned as managers (product, project, HR, Risk etc.) to mentor the introductory course groups. The approach highlighted in this paper builds on previous work [1], which ensured the acquisition of proper software engineering skills through industry mentorship. However, there was need to change the focus to using cross-year student mentorship to improve the degree of accountability and control over the mentorship process while improving the execution of the software project within a limited timeframe. This innovative approach not only enhances student learning outcomes but also optimizes faculty resources and fosters a collaborative learning community within the software engineering program."

    "abstract": "Controlling discrete-time linear systems with unknown model information while reducing control costs poses considerable obstacles. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes two novel data-driven impulsive control (IMC) frameworks for discrete-time linear systems. First, unlike most existing IMC strategies that rely on accurate system models or system identification, the proposed methods can directly design controllers based on measured data. Moreover, for data-driven IMC schemes that respect the average impulsive interval, the exponential stabilization of the system is demonstrated under the strong rank condition by leveraging relevant data and invoking the concepts of Lyapunov functions and the iterative synthesis procedure. Second, to reduce unnecessary impulsive actions during information transmission and thereby enhance control performance, a data-driven event-triggered impulsive control (ETIMC) approach is examined by combining event-triggered control with IMC. To mitigate the requirement for persistent excitation of input data, the concept of data informativity is utilized for analysis, and sufficient criteria for system stabilization under the proposed data-driven ETIMC are established in conjunction with the collected data. Ultimately, the validity of the theoretical results is verified through two illustrative examples."

    "abstract": "This innovative to practice full-paper examines how the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of generating code—exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot—has instigated a pedagogical shift in how programming is taught and learned. As these AI tools become more deeply embedded in professional and academic practices, educators are compelled to reassess traditional pedagogical approaches and realign them with the demands of an AIaugmented future. This paper explores the profound implications of these developments for computer programming education, focusing on the challenges that instructors face and the promising opportunities for curricular innovation. While AI tools provide valuable learning assistance, they risk encouraging superficial understanding if students rely on them excessively. We begin by reviewing major challenges associated with the use of AI tools by students, such as the ease with which students can generate complete code solutions without engaging in the problem-solving process. The birth of code-generating AI also poses significant challenges in maintaining academic rigor and assessment fairness. We also cover a short review of strategies and processes that instructors are employing to combat this issue. Finally, we will present our proposed innovative approach, which includes the integration of AI into programming education by shifting the focus from merely producing code to designing and architecting software systems. This approach encourages students to use AI as a collaborative tool, fostering creativity, strategic thinking, and ethical reasoning. This approach requires greater emphasis on systems thinking and design, which can foster an entrepreneurial mindset."

    "abstract": "In cellular systems, user devices (UEs) establish secure sessions with each other through a trusted server such as the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) or Authentication Center (AuC). The proposed two-party authenticated key establishment allows two users to authenticate and exchange encrypted data with minimal involvement of the server -improving efficiency and scalability in mobile communication. Moreover, this paper presents a cryptanalysis of two post-quantum authentication and key agreement protocols proposed by Dabra et al. and Kumar et al. Our analysis identifies specific weaknesses, a design flaw in the registration phase of Dabra et al.’s protocol, and vulnerabilities to identity guessing and impersonation attacks in Kumar et al.’s scheme. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new communication framework for a two-party authenticated key establishment protocol assisted by a server. In the proposed model, user UA initiates communication by sending a request to a central server and receives a corresponding response to establish an authenticated session key with user UB. Notably, user UB does not need to interact with the server during session initiation or key derivation phases, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead and enhancing efficiency. Through extensive formal analysis and simulation, our protocol achieves 21.37% and 19.99% improvement in computational efficiency and 35.13% and 21.05% reduction in communication overhead compared to the lattice-based authenticated key agreement protocols of Dabra et al. and Kumar et al., respectively. Furthermore, the proposed scheme ensures key freshness, meaning that each session key is unique and has never been used in any prior communication session. This guarantees that every session remains protected by a distinct cryptographic key, even when the same users communicate repeatedly. Additionally, user UA can establish a secure session with user UB without revealing its identity to either UB or any intermediate server, thereby preserving user anonymity. Overall, the proposed protocol offers strong privacy guarantees while enabling secure, authenticated communication with a minimal number of message exchanges."

    "abstract": "Collagen remodelling plays a critical role in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), though misdiagnosis often occurs due to the resemblance with chronic pancreatitis (CP). While second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is the current gold standard in research for visualizing fibrillar collagen, it is not utilized for routine histopathological use. This study highlights the need for an alternative method for quantitative collagen analysis that is compatible with standard hematoxylin and-eosin (HE) stained histopathological slides. Using the computational image-to-image translation approach, whole-core standard brightfield HE images of pancreatic tissues were translated into the new collagen images. From these computationally translated collagen images, quantitative collagen measures were extracted for PDAC, PanIN, CP, and normal pancreatic tissues, and their statistical significance was evaluated. Among the four classes, PDAC tissues exhibited the highest collagen alignment (n = 58, p < 0.01, R² = 0.2594), while normal tissues showed the lowest fiber density (n = 58, p < 0.0001, R² = 0.3569). Seven machine learning models were assessed to differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic tissues cores based on collagen measures extracted from the translated collagen images. Feature importance and ROC-AUC analyses both identified fiber length and collagen deposition area as the most prominent parameters, achieving AUC values of 0.83 and 0.73, respectively, for distinguishing between the tissue classes. The findings demonstrate that the collagen images derived from standard HE stained tissue microarrays (TMAs) whole-core images enable quantitative assessment of collagen remodelling across pancreatic lesions. Additionally, the study indicates that cross-modality image translation, as a cost-effective alternative, has the potential to offer deeper insights into histopathology and tissue microenvironment analysis without requiring collagen-specific imaging equipment or external labels, thereby further supporting its feasibility for integration into standard clinical workflows."

The proposed approach eliminates the TA layer by formulating thruster forces as direct optimization variables, thereby removing the feasibility gap inherent in hierarchical control structures. Furthermore, sparse linearized Gaussian processes enable convex approximation of the nonconvex GP-MPC, significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving complete probabilistic modeling capabilities. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm’s recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. Pool experiments validate the superior performance of the proposed method in complex hydrodynamic environments."

First, a composite U-shaped SSPP cell is utilized, and outer strips are periodically loaded on both sides to form a periodic radiation structure. The propagation constant and dispersion characteristics of SSPPs can be flexibly adjusted. Second, odd-mode SSPPs are excited for endfire radiation, and two SSPP segments with different parameters are combined to lower the sidelobe level. Third, through appropriate modulation and effective suppression of the open stop band effect, full-space scanning and high scanning rate are achieved. Finally, prototypes are fabricated and measured to verify this design. For the endfire mode from 7.0 GHz to 7.8 GHz, a high gain ranging from 12.02 dBi to 14.69 dBi is realized, and the sidelobe level is lower than −10 dB.

In this work, we propose Dike, a bi-level function scheduling and resource allocation framework designed to meet end-to-end latency SLOs (service-level objectives). Dike leverages deep reinforcement learning to balance resource provisioning and monetary cost by incorporating both composite cost and SLO violations into the reward. Extensive simulations with real-world production workloads demonstrate the superiority of Dike. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms approximate the results of state-of-the-art ILP solver within a factor of 1.08 while dramatically reducing the scheduling time."

    "abstract": "Drinking water is crucial for the subsistence of human. Without food for a few days, humans can survive, but without water, it is hard to survive even for 3 to 6 days. Many people residing in the different regions of the world are facing the fecal contamination issues and have no availability of clean drinking water. Two of the big reasons for fecal contamination in drinking water occur if the region is affected by flood and if the sewage has entered the sanitary pipelines due to leaks. Peshawar is one of the oldest cities, having the old sanitary pipelines, as well as Swat, which is one of the flood-affected cities of Pakistan, and our proposed work detects the Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination in the drinking water of the different areas of Peshawar and severely affected areas of Swat after 6 hours of incubation using a custom-made image device that is deployed by our trained YOLOv8 model mAP@50 of 97%. The experiments performed on the water samples of 18 different areas of Peshawar and 10 areas of Swat. The results show the contamination by E. coli bacteria in the Fizagat area is high compared to 9 other areas in Swat, and water samples of Inner City Peshawar were highly contaminated compared to 17 other areas of Peshawar. In future work, the other old residential and flood-affected regions of Pakistan will be covered, i.e., Dir, Nowshera, Mardan, Dera Ismail Khan, etc."

Compared to previous machine learning methods, deep learning models automatically learn features from raw IMU data, leading to more accurate activity recognition. However, the black-box nature of deep learning models limit their application in high-risk areas that require transparency and interpretability. To improve the interpretability of the model, we designed an interpretable human activity recognition method that integrates convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and interpretable analysis based on Shapley value, which is named XRGHAR. Our work not only quantifies the contribution of IMU channels to activity recognition via a global explanation method but also employs interpretable results as feedbacks to enhance model performance. We conducted comprehensive experiments on the HuGaDB dataset and achieved the accuracy of 92.5 %. XRG-HAR significantly improves the model’s interpretability while also leverages interpretable results to improve the performance of recognizing human activities."

    "abstract": "In a flying ad hoc network, each UAV moves freely within the environment, gathers data from various situations (such as disasters, remote sensing in forest regions, border surveillance, traffic monitoring, and wildlife monitoring), and sends all this information to the base station or other UAVs. Malicious UAVs are affecting the network performance. FANET security is a major concern today. Flying devices, also known as drones, have capabilities such as capturing images and are equipped with special sensors that gather specific types of data. However, they have limited processing and memory capacity, which prevents them from performing large-scale data processing or decision-making. Sybil attacker is one of the most harmful attackers since they have stolen the identities of other UAVs and used them to for data dropping. In this paper, proposes a Route and Data Security for hostile Behaviour Prevention (RDSBP) approach for sybil attacker in FANET. Implement a route security system using behaviour analysis on the base station device to detect this type of malicious activity. The attacker node modifies the routing table to make a false route decision, while it diverts the route by updating the next hop address field in the routing packet. The basic function of RDSPB is to identify the actual attacker identity. The base station is responsible for monitoring, controlling, alert message generation, and packet-level filtering for the entire network. While the flying device wants to send data to the intended receiver or base station, it calls the AODV routing procedure and broadcasts the generated route packet into the network. The performance of RDSBP is compared with LOAD and LPAR and the security performance of novel security scheme is better."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice but suffers from speckle noise that obscures fine details and complicates downstream analysis. Supervised denoising requires clean–noisy pairs that are rarely available, highlighting the need for self-supervised approaches. We extend the fast blind denoiser Noise2Fast by introducing simple yet effective one-pixel horizontal and vertical shifts before subsampling, generating additional pseudo input–target pairs. This augmentation in-creases training diversity while keeping inference computation-ally efficient. Experiments on three datasets (BUSI, Fetus, Tel-U) under controlled noise conditions show consistent improvements over existing self-supervised baselines. For example, at $\\sigma _s^2 = 0.5$ our method achieves PSNR values of 25.72 dB, 29.09 dB, and 25.71 dB, outperforming Noise2Fast and Neighbor2Neighbor in most cases. Ablation studies confirm that both shift directions provide complementary gains, though effectiveness varies with dataset and noise severity. While improvements are modest and evaluations rely on synthetic noise, the results demonstrate a practical strategy for ultrasound denoising and motivate future work on adaptive extensions and larger architectures."

This study proposes a User Experience–Driven Design and Evaluation Framework for ESL systems that embeds human-centered design principles and usability evaluation metrics throughout the system development lifecycle. The framework comprises four iterative phases—user research, task analysis, UX-centered interface design, and evaluation—providing structured guidance for developers and retailers in designing intuitive and efficient ESL interactions. A conceptual case study based on a simulated medium-sized retail environment is presented to illustrate the framework’s application and expected outcomes. The conceptual findings indicate potential improvements in task efficiency, error reduction, and perceived usability among both store staff and customers. This work establishes a conceptual foundation for integrating UX principles into ESL system development and highlights the need for future empirical validation and cross-context evaluation within IoT-enabled smart retail ecosystems."

In addition, the effect of the Hadamard gate on the smoothly changing state of the qubit was investigated and the corresponding graph is presented. The paper proposes a qubit model in the form of a modified unit circle, which combines operations only with real numbers in the standard unit circle and symmetry of the Bloch sphere. This makes it possible to abandon the analysis of the vector phase when analyzing the behavior of the qubit model, that is, to abandon the use of complex numbers (amplitudes) when simulating.

Many common explainability techniques are based off gradient-based, or perturbation based approach that could fail to understand global aspects of neural network behavior. In this paper, we introduce Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with special emphasis on persistent homology, as one of the most useful and powerful frameworks for understanding, and visualizing deep learning model dynamics, through regards to the structured, or topological features in high-dimensional activation spaces in which TDA can expose important patterns (clusters, loops, voids, etc.) as the behavioral traits that neural networks exhibit. We examine the evolution of topological signatures during training in order to understand characteristics such as feature learning, overfitting and generalization. We present experiments using standard architectures (such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)) across datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 which show that persistent diagrams and barcodes are useful for distinguishing structural changes in learned representations. Additionally, TDA-based summaries also offered model agnostic analysis which allowed us to compare representations across different architectures and optimization strategies. By bringing together topological perspective with traditional performance metrics, this study expands our understanding of model behavior, and sets the stage for topology aware model design and evaluation, ultimately establishing TDA as an important approach in the pursuit of explainable and interpretable deep learning."

This study integrates Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation(GEDI) LiDAR data with multi-source remote sensing features to construct a multi-dimensional feature space comprising 13 parameters. By employing high-dimensional feature vectors of “spatial coordinates + environmental features,” the proposed deep learning-based Neural Network-Guided Interpolation (NNGI) model effectively harnesses the capacity of deep learning to model complex nonlinear relationships and adaptively extract local features.This method adopts a dual-network collaborative architecture to dynamically learn interpolation weights based on environmental similarity in the feature space, rather than relying on fixed parameters or merely considering spatial distance, thereby effectively fusing the complex nonlinear relationship modeling capability of deep learning with the concept of spatial interpolation.Experiments conducted across five representative regions in the United States demonstrate that the overall accuracy of the NNGI model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods,Pearson correlation coefffcient (r)=0.79, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)=5.38 m, Mean Absolute Error(MAE)=4.04 m, Bias=-0.15 m. In areas with low (0-20%) and high (61-80%) vegetation cover fractions, the RMSE decreased by 37.52% and 5.37%, respectively, while the r-value increased by 15.87% and 35.90%, respectively. Regarding different slope aspects, the RMSE for southeastern and western slopes decreased by 30.38% and 18.70%, respectively.

This paper proposes an online learning framework tailored for streaming text classification under distribution shifts. First, we decompose a neural network-based text classification model into distinct modules and analyze the varying impact of updating these modules under different types of shifts. Based on this insight, we define three novel indicators to efficiently measure the extent of distribution shifts without evaluating the entire model. These indicators enable the development of predictive models that dynamically optimize module update strategies, balancing learning efficiency and accuracy in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to systematically adapt model updates according to a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in online text classification. Extensive experiments on real-world streaming datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which consistently outperforms both static update strategies and state-of-the-art online text classification models.

This study introduces a novel SSL approach, Information-Maximized Soft Variable Discretization (IMSVD), for image representation learning. Specifically, IMSVD softly discretizes each variable in the latent space, enabling the estimation of their probability distributions over training batches and allowing the learning process to be directly guided by information measures. Motivated by the MultiView assumption, we propose an information-theoretic objective function to learn transform-invariant, non-trivial, and redundancy-minimized representation features. We then derive a joint-cross entropy loss function for self-supervised image representation learning, which theoretically enjoys superiority over the existing methods in reducing feature redundancy. Notably, our non-contrastive IMSVD method statistically performs contrastive learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IMSVD on various downstream tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Thanks to our variable discretization, the embedding features optimized by IMSVD offer unique explainability at the variable level. IMSVD has the potential to be adapted to other learning paradigms.

One of the key challenges in such systems is maintaining voltage stability under dynamic variations in input voltage and load conditions. A bidirectional buck-boost converter offers an effective solution for regulating bidirectional power flow, yet its overall performance strongly depends on the control strategy used. This study proposes the design and simulation of a hybrid control system for a bidirectional buck-boost converter to achieve robust voltage regulation under varying operating conditions. The proposed hybrid control dynamically determines the switching modes buck, boost, or freewheeling based on the instantaneous values of inductor current and capacitor voltages, based on a decision rule derived from the converter's state-space model. The mathematical model of the converter is formulated for four switching configurations and implemented in the MATLAB Simulink environment using MATLAB Function blocks. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid control successfully maintains the output voltage close to the reference value, with a rapid transient response and minimal steady-state oscillation, even under fluctuations in the source and load. The proposed method demonstrates high robustness and flexibility, with the presence of parasitic components such as resistances not significantly affecting system performance, thereby simplifying state-space analysis compared to conventional PI control. Moreover, the hybrid control does not require high-accuracy sensor measurements, allowing the converter to operate reliably even when implemented with low-resolution ADC hardware. The findings confirm that the proposed hybrid control method enhances the dynamic performance and voltage regulation capability of bidirectional buck-boost converters, making it a promising solution for renewable energy storage systems, electric vehicle power interfaces, and DC microgrid applications that require efficient, reliable, and adaptive power control."

Achieving this requires accurate effort estimation, which helps determine the necessary manpower, resources, timeline, and costs involved in software development. However, widely employed traditional \"Software Development Effort Estimation (SDEE)\" techniques are considered outdated, inflexible, and inaccurate due to the growing complexities of modern software. Expert estimation remains a pivotal traditional technique for exploiting human expertise, although relying entirely on this technique results in human bias and subjectivity. Machine Learning (ML) has recently acquired prominence to improve SDEE. Nonetheless, ML models based on a single algorithm may lead to suboptimal accuracy and be ineffective in handling a wide range of SDEE challenges.

To address these challenges, we recruited a cohort of graduate students to create sociotechnical modules for an “Introduction to Circuits” course. We piloted three modules to groups of former circuits students to assess the efficacy of the modules before implementing them broadly. After participating in the module facilitated by its creator, undergraduate students in the pilot completed an evaluation survey. Overall, they reported the modules to be interesting and engaging, believed that the social topics were well integrated with the technical ones, and appreciated the real-world examples. The modules were refined based on the student feedback and will be facilitated in both small and large “Introduction to Circuits” classrooms."

Through zero-shot evaluation, and using an identical experimental protocol through a unified processing pipeline, we observe a catastrophic drop of 42.33 % accuracy between two standard diabetic retinopathy datasets: we see DINOv2 achieves 96.18 % binary classification accuracy on APTOS (3,662 images) but only 53.85 % on IDRiD (597 images). This striking drop in performance occurs despite both datasets representing the same clinical task of 5-grade diabetic retinopathy severity classification from fundus photographs. A unified analysis shows that this apparent “success” on APTOS is attributable to the model's ability to classify Grade 0 (no DR) with an F 1 -score of 95.71 %. In contrast, the model only achieves <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F 1$</tex>-scores of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$43-52 \\%$</tex> for minority disease grades, illustrating that DINOv2 does not adequately detect minority disease grades on either dataset. On IDRiD, the model totally fails to detect Grade 1 diabetic retinopathy (0 % precision and recall) and we find that attention mechanisms exhibit less than 1.2 % intersection over union overlap with clinical annotation of lesions. Analysis of the feature space revealed that separability is extremely poor, showing an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.092 on IDRiD, compared to 0.231 on APTOS. This data highlights that high accuracy on a single dataset for medical imaging cannot be generalized to another dataset, even for the same disease and imaging modality, which has serious implications for the reliability of zero-shot foundation model performance in direct clinical applications."

    "abstract": "To address challenges in renewable energy integration and low load forecasting accuracy, this study proposes a machine learning-integrated strategy for renewable energy prediction. The proposed approach first designs a load forecasting model based on TCN-BiGRU-Attention that accurately captures load time-series characteristics and process coupling relationships, thereby improving short-term prediction accuracy. Subsequently, the model's hyperparameters are optimized using an enhanced Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm to enhance diagnostic performance and generalization capabilities. Experimental results show that the proposed HO-TCN-BiGRU-Attention model outperforms other models in both error control and fitting capability. By automating hyperparameter optimization through an improved Hippo algorithm (HO), the model effectively captures key features in aluminum electrolysis load sequences and models both short- and long-term dependencies. This multi-model fusion approach reduces prediction error by 43.1%, providing high-precision decision support for renewable energy scheduling and enhancing practical applicability."

    "abstract": "Sarcasm detection is a fine-grained problem in natural language processing since it depends on implicit meaning, context features, and user behavior. This paper is a comparative analysis of several learning approaches to predicting sarcastic content by fusing textual features, contextual features, and user behavioral features. The experiments are performed on standard test sets, i.e., Twitter, Reddit, and MUStARD, by using classical machine learning approaches, deep neural network architectures, and transformer-based systems. The outcome suggests that transformer-based systems, namely BERT and RoBERTa, significantly outperform traditional systems. Moreover, employing context features and user behavior features improve classification performance with significant improvement in F1-scores. These findings establish the need for multi-dimensional modeling to determine sarcastic content and provide a baseline system to be extended towards multimodal, cross-lingual, and explainable systems to predict sarcastic content."

    "abstract": "This study introduces Federated Transformer Graphs (FTG), a framework for multisite predictive maintenance that protects user privacy and combines graph relational learning with temporal attention, enabled by industrial sensor networks. In addition, each node must know how to use transformer attention to duplicate long-range deterioration, how to document interactions between sensors using graph convolutions, and how to integrate multi-modal sensors in the local area. Even if there isn't a central place to store raw data, a fusion block can nevertheless make predictive representations. A secure federated layer might use homomorphic encryption and differential privacy to aggregate changes made to many sites. This lets people work together while keeping their information secret. FTG can find faults and estimate RUL at once with multi-location benchmarks. With good time-series, graph, and table baselines, such an outcome is possible. FTG decreases the Miss@1% FA to 20.3% at the operational low-false-alarm threshold, which is a 9.6 percentage point improvement over the next best. It also has an AUPRC value of 0.873 and a classification AUROC rating of 0.962. The MAE and RMSE drop to 5.3 and 8.3, respectively, because of FTG. It makes the probability more accurate (Pinball <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\tau=0.9= 4.2$</tex>) and makes sure that uncertainty is distributed out evenly (Coverage <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\approx 0.93$</tex> with small gaps). This results in an approach that is both effective and secure for Industry 4.0. Inference operates on a millisecond scale; therefore, the procedure is still accurate even if the distribution changes."

    "abstract": "Virtualization is a foundational technology in modern IT infrastructure, enabling efficient resource utilization and flexible system management. This paper compares the performance of virtual machines (VMs) and bare-metal (non-virtualized) systems using Geekbench 6 on a Linux platform with KVM and Proxmox. We systematically benchmarked single-core and multi-core performance across various VM configurations and resource allocations. Our results indicate that single-core performance in VMs is consistently lower than on bare metal, with multi-core workloads experiencing further degradation as VM count increases. These findings highlight the importance of careful resource allocation and monitoring in virtualized environments and provide a baseline for developing more efficient dynamic scaling algorithms for Linux-based virtualization. In our tests, running a virtual machine (VM) with all 12 CPU cores and 24 GB RAM achieved a multi-core Geekbench 6 score of 4757, while the bare-metal (host) system scored 8057. This means the VM was about $41 \\%$ slower (or, had a $41 \\%$ performance overhead) compared to the host. When running 8 VMs in parallel (each with 2 CPU cores and 4 GB RAM), the total combined score was 7149, which is about 89% of the bare-metal score."

This study segments stress levels among students using a probabilistic clustering approach based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). A dataset of 1,100 student records with 20 features across psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, and social domains was preprocessed, standardized, and reduced via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), retaining 16 components that explained 95.6% of the total variance. GMM clustering was tested across configurations, with model selection guided by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The optimal solution was achieved with four clusters and a full covariance type (BIC = 20,001.18; AIC = 17,904.89). The resulting clusters were interpreted as Social Stress (Mixed) (Cluster 0), Psychological Distress (Cluster 1), Resilient / Low Stress (Cluster 2), and Physiological Stress (Mixed) (Cluster 3). Distribution across clusters was balanced, with three groups of about 300 students and one group of approximately 200. Validation results confirmed strong performance, with an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.7102, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) of 0.7280, and a Silhouette Score of 0.4867, reflecting good alignment with labels and clear inter-cluster separation. Visualization of clusters in reduced PCA space further demonstrated that GMM successfully identified distinct subgroup structures. These findings highlight the potential of combining PCA with GMM to uncover nuanced stress patterns, providing valuable insights for targeted academic and mental health interventions."

    "abstract": "Bird sounds are a rich source of information that can significantly enhance our understanding of avian biodiversity, behavior, and their ecological roles. Ornithological research is driven by the need to understand avian biodiversity and their ecological dynamics. It relies heavily on accurate identifications and analysis of bird sounds. The manual analysis of bird songs is time-consuming and is prone to human errors, limiting the scope and efficiency of research efforts. Despite these problems, research efforts and technological advancement has made it possible to automate the process of species classification based on their sound. This study presents a novel approach for automated bird sound classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients combined with Spectral Contrast, creating a two-channel MTF image representation processed through a CNN model. This approach captures both timbral and harmonic characteristics in a unified image representation. Ten bird species were studied and will be classified: (1) barn swallow, (2) Eurasian coot, (3) Gray Heron, (4) Gray-Headed Canary Flycatcher, (5) Kentish Plover, (6) Large-Billed Crow, (7) Purple Heron, (8) Rock Pigeon, (9) Whiskered Tern, and (10) Wood Sandpiper. Each species represents a mix of habitats. Each gathered from BirdCLEF 2024 data set, a large-scale benchmark for bird sound classification. The model's performance resulted in an 89.9% score in the accuracy metric, 89.5% in precision, 88.9% in recall, and lastly 89.2% for the F1-score. The approach outperformed its ablation study with a performance gain of approximately 4%, and 3.6% over the baseline approach."

The main ideology of this project is to reduce the traffic issues over these websites or applications. To reduce the workload over a particular server, we have created multiple servers and divided microservices over them so that, whenever the load increases over the main server, the extra load can be transferred to other servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Secure Cloud Migration Strategy (SCMS) that combines step-by-step migration planning, microservice-based restructuring, and built-in security practices. The framework distributes applications across multiple servers, applies load balancing, and continuously monitors performance. This design reduces latency, prevents traffic slowdowns, and improves overall system scalability."

Traditional attendance-taking during examinations is a time-consuming task, vulnerable to impersonation, human error, and inefficiency. This study presents the design, development, and evaluation of a Face Recognition Attendance System (FRAS) that leverages mobile computing and artificial intelligence to automate attendance tracking in examination environments. The system combines a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deployed through TensorFlow Lite and Firebase for secure cloud synchronization. Using the Agile development framework, the project was iteratively tested across multiple university examination sessions. Experimental results demonstrate an average recognition accuracy of 95.4% under normal lighting conditions, along with a $70 \\%$ reduction in total attendance processing time compared to manual procedures. The proposed FRAS model demonstrates practicality, reliability, and scalability, making it suitable for future integration with institutional digital ecosystems. This paper contributes a validated model for biometric attendance in academic settings. Specifically, the system offers a solution that achieves near-perfect identity verification ($\\gt98 \\%$) in realtime, a framework that is scalable across diverse examination venues and integrates seamlessly with existing university databases.

The methodology involved training on the DMR dataset, comprising 1,800 thermal images, and evaluating performance across ten color schemes, including RGB, LAB, YCbCr, and CYMK. Results showed that the CYMK color scheme achieved the highest validation accuracy (98.18%) and the lowest validation loss (0.0598), with the shortest training time (3.01s per epoch). LAB and YCbCr also demonstrated strong performance, while grayscale and XYZ schemes lagged. This work confirms that color space optimization can significantly impact deep learning performance. Future work will investigate multi-color space fusion strategies and real-time deployment for clinical decision support systems."

Drawing on qualitative interviews with 23 engineering students who completed workplace placements, the study investigates students' development of epistemic beliefs about professional practices and tools. The research identifies software packages like Excel, MATLAB, and CAD programs as significant boundary objects that both connect and highlight differences between educational and professional settings. While these tools provide continuity between environments, students encounter significant discontinuities in their application, required proficiency levels, and integration into workflows. The study applies Akkerman and Bakker's four boundary-crossing mechanisms—identification, coordination, reflection, and transformation—to analyze how students leverage these tools to develop professional identities and adapt to workplace cultures. Findings reveal that students experience a substantial gap between academic preparation and industry expectations, particularly regarding software proficiency. In academic settings, students typically learn basic functionality, while industry demands advanced usage and integration with other systems to solve complex, real-world problems under financial, safety, and time constraints. The research suggests engineering education could better prepare students for workplace transitions by emphasizing adaptability across software platforms, advanced applications, and authentic problem-solving that more closely mirrors professional practice. This study contributes to understanding how boundary objects facilitate epistemic learning in engineering education and professional development."

The model retrieves candidate targets based on regional and visual semantics and reranks them with affordance scores, allowing the robot to identify manipulation options that are likely to be executable in real-world environments. Our method outperformed existing approaches in retrieval performance for mobile manipulation instruction in large-scale indoor environments. Furthermore, in real-world experiments where the robot performed mobile manipulation in indoor environments based on free-form instructions, the proposed method achieved a task success rate of 85%, outperforming existing methods in both retrieval performance and overall task success."

In the process of sharing the patient data, the centralised system suffers from data integrity and security issues. Federated approaches are widely adopted for sharing patient information without the need for actual patient data to be transferred. In Federated learning, conventional approaches follow normal mathematical operations during the aggregation process, where fairness in adaptation is often compromised in these systems. The Meta Learning FL model effectively aggregates patient data by allocating weights to local updates based on pre-trained models. This improves the fairness and generalisation among the patient data, where the accuracy of the proposed work attained 85 % which shows an improvement of 10 % compared to the conventional FedAVG model using the MIMIC III dataset from Kaggle."

This study introduces a unique methodology—Blockchain-Integrated Transformer Ensemble Framework (BiTE-F)—that combines sophisticated deep learning algorithms with decentralised blockchain systems to improve forecast accuracy and reliability in dynamic contexts. The proposed architecture utilizes an ensemble of Transformer-based models, trained local on node-specific data using federated learning methodologies, permit situational and domain-aware prediction avoiding the need for central data aggregating. To ensure data integrity, facilitate model transparency and provide tampering obstruction, BiTE-F incorporates an encrypted blockchain layer that documents hashing snapshot of training datasets, model revisions, and predictions records. A decentralized agreement technique, Proof-of-Model-Integrity (PoMI), guarantees the acceptance of only correct and reliable modeling their contributions into the global ensembles. Moreover, smart contracts are used for automating the creation of risk alerts and the corresponding mitigation solutions in real time. This collaborative integration enhances distributed systems with safe, transparent, and precise risk modeling capacities. The suggested approach is especially appropriate for sectors such as healthcare, financial services, industrial IoT, and cyber-physical systems, where trust, precision, and real-time insights are critical. The suggested BiTE-F framework had an overall accuracy of 98.6% in predicting performance."

Surface waves lead to the emergence of blind angles during wide-angle beam steering (exceeding 120°). The study briefly outlines the architecture of a printed-circuit antenna element, highlights key topological challenges in implementing cavity structure, and provides experimental results of the PAA’s scanning performance. The primary causes of gain degradation in such arrays during wideband frequency operation and wide-angle scanning are identified, including reduced radiation efficiency and the appearance of blindness dip in scan element pattern. Special emphasis is placed on engineering design methodologies to mitigate these effects in centimeter-wavelength microstrip PAAs, including arrays employing sequential rotation technique (SRT) for element excitation."

Our architecture introduces a generative module capable of synthesizing realistic multimodal data, combining sensor signals and contextual information, conditioned on highlevel situations. By leveraging conditional generative models such as CVAE, CGAN, Diffusion Models, we generate situationrich synthetic data that improve model generalization, addresses data scarcity, and improves robustness for situation recognition tasks. Experiments on the Extrasensory dataset demonstrate that models trained with our synthetic data achieve a $4.34 \\%$ improvement in accuracy and $11 \\%$ gain in balanced accuracy over baselines. Unlike previous HAR data augmentation methods that generate only sensor signals, the proposed approach explicitly integrates situation awareness during generation, supporting more intelligent, context-aware wearable systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a 1×3 wideband antenna subarray dedicated for in a transceiver radio unit with an integrated antenna (Active Antenna System, AAS) of modern mobile communication systems M-MIMO 5G NR (New Radio). The antenna element of the subarray is a dual-polarization (±45o slant linear polarization) dipole radiator based on a vertically oriented crossed printed circuit boards (PCBs). A specific 1:3 feeding system has been developed that combines the power from the antenna elements. The dimensions of the antenna subarray are 0.5λ×2.1λ×0.4λ. The antenna subarray return loss level is 20 dB. The antenna gain is about 11 dBi, and the crosstalk discrimination of the far-field radiation is less than −25 dB in the operating frequency range of 3.3–3.8 GHz (n78 band). The relative bandwidth of operating frequencies is 50% at a level of 10 dB return loss (RL). The main lobe radiation pattern half-power beamwidth is 32.5° in the vertical plane and 98° in the horizontal plane. The side lobe level is not exceeding 13 dB. To reduce the mutual coupling between the antenna elements within the subarray, additional metal walls were used. They are realized on printed circuit boards (PCBs). These walls allow obtaining a port-to-port isolation level of 25 dB and cross coupling levels between adjacent subarrays of at least 20 dB when combining several subarrays into an antenna array. In addition, the antenna subarray prototypes were manufactured and tested. The measurement results of the produced prototypes confirmed the simulation results."

    "abstract": "The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, driven by climate change, underscore the crucial role of communication systems in modern emergency management. Unlike energy infrastructures, which have advanced toward greater autonomy and resilience, traditional communication networks remain highly centralized, rigid, and dependent on fixed power sources, making them particularly vulnerable during crises. These limitations hinder their adaptability and reliability in disaster scenarios. To address these challenges, recent efforts have focused on rethinking emergency communication architectures by leveraging heterogeneous technologies such as Mobile Base Stations (BSs), Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) for Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity, and satellite communications. These innovations enable the creation of dynamic, reconfigurable architectures capable of adapting to rapidly changing conditions in real time. However, enabling such flexibility requires more than new architectures. Indeed, it demands intelligent, secure, scalable, and real-time operational strategies. To this end, in this paper, we propose a forward-looking vision for emergency communication infrastructures that integrates both existing and emerging network entities. We examine the specific communication-related challenges posed by disaster scenarios and advocate for the adoption of innovative architectures to support timely, informed responses. Finally, we outline future research directions aimed at embedding emerging technologies into these architectures to enhance the capabilities of nextgeneration emergency communication systems."

    "abstract": "Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a promising pathway to address computational challenges in domains such as chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this work, we present a hybrid embedding framework to simulate the dative interaction between a lithium ion and a pyridine molecule. This represents the first implementation of quantum hardware for evaluating the binding energy of a non-covalent dative-bonded complex. Due to the current limitations of classical simulators and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices—typically restricted to circuits with a few dozen qubits—we employ an embedding strategy where a chemically active region is treated on a quantum processor, and the remainder is modeled classically. Without error mitigation, results from quantum hardware show notable deviations from exact energies. To address this, we implement two combined error mitigation strategies, CEM1 and CEM2, both of which significantly improve total energy estimates. This work highlights the practical potential of variational quantum algorithms for studying complex molecular systems relevant to catalysis, hydrogen storage, and battery technologies."

    "abstract": "Delayed detection and ineffective treatment are the main reasons why mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever and malaria have become a major obstacle to health advancement in tropical areas. In order to predict vector-borne diseases by examining environmental and clinical characteristics, the proposed work assesses five machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Means clustering, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). These models are trained and tested in the study using a labelled dataset from certain geographic locations. Oversampling techniques are used to guarantee a balanced class distribution in order to address the problem of imbalanced datasets. With an 89% prediction accuracy, the SVM model outperforms K-Means clustering (86%), Random Forest (67%), Naive Bayes (64%), and KNN (30%). Early vector-borne infection prediction is made easier by the SVM-based model's incorporation of clinical and environmental variables. The results of the trial demonstrate the strategy can save time and money by allowing medical professionals to take preventative action before crises occur. A thorough assessment of the models' performance is provided by a detailed examination of recall, precision, and F1-score."

Standard augmentation techniques typically apply transformations uniformly across all images, which does not effectively address this imbalance. In this paper, we propose a targeted augmentation strategy that applies transformations only to crack-positive images, while leaving background images unchanged. When combined with RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer) for instance segmentation, our approach improves the class balance by a factor of five (from 17.1:1 to 3.4:1) and achieves higher detection accuracy compared to conventional augmentation methods. We evaluate the proposed method on a custom dashcam dataset of 5,678 images and present a detailed analysis of the augmentation process, training procedure, and performance results. This work demonstrates the potential of targeted augmentation for real-time crack detection, geospatial road mapping, and driver assistance applications."

    "abstract": "The widespread use of 3D objects in many fields poses new challenges for their secure transmission, storage and visualization. While selective encryption methods allow format compliance and enable adjustable security by selectively encrypting 3D geometry, they produce visible noise and disrupt geometric coherence which reduces compression efficiency. In this paper, we propose a reversible deformation method for 3D object protection that breaks with state-of-the-art 3D security approaches by offering more natural and visually coherent protection. The deformation is applied directly to the geometry, controlled by a secret key, and can be adjusted to achieve the desired level of visual security. Experimental results presented on a large database demonstrate that our method offers protection comparable to selective encryption, while providing significantly greater resilience to reconstruction attacks such as Laplacian smoothing, particularly at low security levels where selective encryption is more vulnerable. This work introduces a new direction for format-compliant 3D object protection, designed for secure visualization in untrusted environments."

In this paper, we propose a beamforming approach that processes specific angular sectors based on their spherical polar coordinates before applying an end-to-end multichannel, multi-speaker ASR system. This method is data-independent and training-free. We demonstrate that using a group of beamformed signals improves ASR performance compared to using the same number of raw microphone signals. Moreover, increasing the number of signals used for beamforming further enhances recognition accuracy, leading to a more efficient use of multichannel signals while reducing the overall input load for the ASR system. We conduct experiments on the AMI meeting corpus, where the proposed method reduces word error rate by up to 11% and improves speaker counting accuracy by up to 27% relative compared to a multichannel ASR baseline system that does not exploit beamforming."

Traditional surveillance platforms cannot identify civil or military airplanes frequently due to camouflage patterns during complicated situations.

A rich dataset is constructed to train the model, and an easy-to-use web application is created to support real-time analysis. The users can upload images and enter relevant information, and the system can return quick identification results. This proposed method follows an accurate and efficient approach for gathering datasets, training, validating, and deploying the model. Test results indicate that the use of YOLOv8-based models increases detection accuracy and reduces cases of misidentification which augments countermeasures of aviation security. The approach provides a dependable and efficient solution for real-time identification of airplanes which has tangible applications in airspace surveillance and security management."

Despite advances in research, the temporal patterns and nonlinear characteristics of its health effects are still not fully understood. Traditional analytical methods often fail to capture the complex and dynamic nature of changing environmental conditions. This study applies distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) to examine the relationship between PM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.5</inf> exposure and respiratory mortality in California from 2014 to 2023, focusing on changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. DLNMs use flexible statistical techniques, including Bsplines for the exposure dimension and natural splines for the lag dimension, allowing the model to capture both nonlinear exposureresponse relationships and temporal dependencies. The results reveal a nonlinear, U-shaped exposure-response curve, with the lowest relative risk observed at PM 2.5 concentrations of $20-22 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$, and a sharp increase in risk at higher concentrations. Notably, the correlation between PM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.5</inf> and health outcomes differed before and during the pandemic.

In building detection there will be difficulties if it is done using traditional methods because many buildings are made of similar raw materials, so a more sophisticated method is needed to detect buildings automatically. Advances in technology have led to more sophisticated methods that can be implemented, one of which is a neural network that can be used for automatic building detection. However, neural networks require a large enough memory because the number of parameters is quite large. Based on these problems, the Transformer Ghost Residual U-Net (TGRU-Net) architecture is proposed for automatic building detection from high-resolution satellite imagery from the Massachusetts Building Dataset. The proposed method is based on U-Net using Residual Network, Vision Transformer, and Ghost Bottleneck. The proposed method will be trained using a training set and after training it will be tested using a test set. The test produces an F1-Score and IoU which will be compared with several previous methods. The proposed method produces better performance than the previous methods with an F1-Score of 85.26%, an IoU of 74.37%, and a parameter of 11.66 million."

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate an optimization method with a wavelet transform, which, by introducing second-order constraints and reducing the number of calls to the oracle for the values of the objective function, can improve the speed of searching for the optimum in important problems of the specified systems. An improvement of the optimization method using the wavelet transform with second-order constraints (in the form of inequalities) is presented. A justified reduction in the number of processing stages with a hyperbolic wavelet function can improve the efficiency of searching for the extremum of the objective function when solving classification problems."

    "abstract": "In microservice architecture, each industrial application is decomposed into multiple microservices and deployed on cloud servers to provide timely services to users. However, existing methods rarely optimize service deployment strategies from the user's perspective to reduce the leasing costs of cloud servers. Furthermore, accurately estimating the required number of instances and resource utilization for microservices remains challenging, and decision-making in large-scale scenarios also faces significant timeliness constraints. To solve this problem, this article proposes a Column Generation deployment strategy, which decomposes the microservice deployment problem into a master problem for scheme selection and subproblems for scheme generation and proves the gap between its convergent solution and the optimal solution. A Distributed Column Generation strategy is further introduced to enable efficient problem-solving. Experimental results based on real-world server pricing demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a high degree of consistency with the theoretically optimal solution. Compared to the baseline methods, it reduces the average total cost of ownership (TCO) for users by 11.3%, while the decision-making time is only 21.5% of that of the comparative methods. At the same time we used our approach to make deployment decisions for real industrial microservices and deployed them on real cloud servers. Compared to the baseline approach, it reduces TCO by 4%, but decision-making is 97% faster."

However, Chinese ZEL remains challenging due to the limited research on Chinese entity linking and emerging entities. The predominant two-stage model often overlooks the unique characteristics of Chinese, which limits its ability to capture a wider range of semantic information. To address this, we propose CFCE-ZEL, a ZEL model based on Chinese Feature Convolutional Embeddings (CFCE), which is built upon the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture for contextualized representations and integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Chinese feature extraction. The model adopts a two-step framework that generates and ranks candidate entities to produce the final entity linking results. It further employs a convolutional neural network and integrates Chinese-specific feature embeddings at both image and character levels, namely glyph and radical embeddings, to enhance word representations and mitigate the impact of out-of-vocabulary words. Moreover, we employ FAISS and knowledge distillation to improve the efficiency of the two-stage model while maintaining a balance between speed and performance. Extensive experiments on the Hansel dataset show that CFCE-ZEL outperforms multiple baselines in both candidate entity generation and ranking, while maintaining high efficiency with FAISS and knowledge distillation."

In this article, an accelerated technique by implementing the Gram–Schmidt process in a low-dimensional space is applied to improve the SGMRES algorithm, which can significantly reduce the elapsed CPU time. The analysis of the principle of the new algorithm is discussed in detail. Numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art large data set high-precision sorting algorithms typically use hardware-accelerated radix sort. Advances in Dynamic Random Access Memory, Flash and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) have enabled faster bandwidth intensive merge operations, where distribution-dependent data pre-processing techniques such as stochastic sampling bucketing offer alternatives impacted by increased data passes and vulnerability to data skew. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">This work addresses these limitations by introducing a compressed radix-sorting scheme for high-precision keys. Whereas radix sort histograms grow exponentially with precision, FractalSort guarantees bounded histogram size through the novel compression scheme which translates into smaller sorting circuits and reduced memory usage. Another key contribution is the novel optimized merge algorithm, which eliminates the need for data pre-processing and bucketing leading to higher bandwidth efficiency and reduced algorithm complexity. Using a tree-based recursive sorting architecture for space efficiency and low latency, the algorithm achieves fast sorting that exceeds the state-of-the-art on the CPU, FPGA, and GPU by 6x, 2.5x, and 3x bandwidth-adjusted throughput on 4GB to 2TB data sets. FractalSort is implemented on Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA empirically demonstrating on-chip sorting at 20 Tb/s capable of memory-to-memory sorting of 32-bit keys at 3.2Tb/s using HBM.</p>"

Conducted in an introductory aerospace engineering course redesigned according to Jonassen's design theory of problemsolving, the study followed students as they engaged with four ill-structured, complex problems, two single-week and two multi-week case analysis and selection problems. Using a quantitative design, we collected pre- and post-reflection survey data, including a Likert-scale item on self-efficacy, at multiple points throughout the course, resulting in ten self-reports per student. While overall analyses showed an increase in students' self-efficacy beliefs from pre-to-post course measurements, repeated measures revealed notable fluctuations across episodes, influenced by the specific context, expectations, difficulty, and level of support associated with each problem. These patterns suggest that although individual problems contributed to increased confidence, such gains were not fully stabilized or transferable to new contexts. The findings underscore the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of selfefficacy development in PBL settings and suggest that singular pre/post measures may overlook key moments of change. Sustained, transferable gains in self-efficacy may require repeated, long-term engagement with open-ended problems that vary in type, expectation, and support."

    "abstract": "Globally, mental health disorders impact one in seven adolescents, with the Indonesia–National Adolescent Mental Health Survey (I-NAMHS) reporting Indonesia as 34.9% having at least one mental health issue. Concerns such as anxiety, depression, and stress affect academic performance among students. Although data mining has been utilized in mental health research, focused studies on younger school-aged populations are limited. This study addresses the gap by focusing on school-aged populations and developing a predictive model using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework. Unlike most existing work focused on university students, this model is tailored to early adolescents and demonstrates the potential for integration into school information systems. A dataset of 426 junior and senior high school students from a single institution with 16 attributes was used and evaluated across three scenarios: junior high, senior high, and combined datasets. The decision tree achieved the highest accuracy (91.59%) on junior high school dataset, while the random forest outperformed others on senior high school (95.07%) and combined datasets (95.28%). To demonstrate practical application, a prototype system was developed to integrate predictive analytics into school support structures. This prototype highlights the feasibility of deploying data mining for early detection of mental health risks in educational settings. The findings underscore the potential of predictive mental health analytics to support early detection efforts among school-aged students, thereby enhancing educational outcomes through targeted, data-driven interventions."

In programming courses, students need to learn both about code correctness and quality. Autograders have been used to support checking correctness of student code, but quality has mostly been ignored. SAs may be used to provide reports on code quality, such as checking whether students abide by coding standards and adequate coding style. Related work on student code quality in programming courses is scarce, especially in CS2 courses. The study analyzes a code dataset from 496 students from 10 different CS2 classes, and describes coding style issues both qualitatively and quantitatively. From prevalent style issues, we derived four metrics to summarize coding style problems related to formatting and naming identifiers. Then, we characterized student coding style to understand its relation with autograder student performance. Results provide more thorough understanding of student code quality regarding style, which may be useful to both researchers and instructors."

While conventional approaches predominantly depend on ground-based observatories, their lack of autonomy and scalability limits their applications in deep-space exploration tasks. This paper presents Deep Visual Feature-Driven Map-Assisted Localization (DVD-MapAL), a novel method that combines visual odometry with prior map constraints to establish a self-contained localization system. The proposed architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) a coordinate-constrained pose optimization module that dynamically corrects cumulative errors in visual odometry through geometric consistency verification, and (2) a lightweight deep feature descriptor with a spatial inhibition mechanism enabling robust projection estimation between orbital imagery and pre-existing maps. We release a comprehensive simulation dataset containing 11,721 photorealistic images with six-degree-of-freedom annotations, generated through Unreal Engine and AirSim platforms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DVD-MapAL’s superior performance, achieving 23.64% lower mean positional error than ORB-SLAM3 in spacecraft scenarios. Further validation on real-world datasets reveals 17.89% improvement over conventional visual localization methods, particularly in feature-deprived extraterrestrial environments. The open-source implementation and benchmark dataset will be made publicly available."

Motor imagery electroencephalog-raphy (MI-EEG) is widely used in BCIs, but its nonlinear dynamics and inter-subject variability limit decoding accuracy. In this paper, a multiscale hybrid attention network (MSHANet) for MI-EEG decoding, which consists of spatiotemporal feature extraction (STFE), talking head self-attention (THSA), dynamic squeeze-and-excitation attention (DSEA), and a temporal convolutional network (TCN), is proposed. MSHANet was evaluated via within-subject experiments using BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, as well as EEGMMID, achieving decoding accuracies of 83.56%, 89.75%, and 75.66%, respectively. In cross-subject experiments on the three datasets, the mode lattained accuracies of 69.93% on BCI-2a, 81.85% on BCI-2b, and 79.67% on EEGMMID. In addition, we propose an electrode spatial structure-aware encoder. This technique encodes the spatial positions of electrodes in the original data, enabling the model to obtain richer spatial electrode information at the input stage. In within-subject and cross-subject tasks on BCI-2a, this encoding improved the decoding performance by 2.83% and 2.91%, respectively. Visualization was also employed to elucidate feature distributions and the effec tiveness of its attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that MSHANet performs exceptionally well in MI-EEG decoding tasks and has high potential for clinical applications, particularly in neurorehabilitation and motor function reconstruction."

Using survey data from 443 Chinese firms, our findings indicate that BDA technical skills primarily enhance exploitative innovation, while BDA managerial skills contribute to both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Additionally, the interaction between technical and managerial BDA skills fosters a synergistic effect, further strengthening a firm’s ability to facilitate ambidextrous innovation. This study contributes to the understanding of how BDA skill sets can be leveraged to drive firm innovation and ultimately enhance firm performance."

To protect against these threats, security solutions such as anti-malware and intrusion-detection-systems have been introduced over the years.

In this paper, we adopt a proactive strategy aimed at anticipating threats before they occur. We introduce a system that leverages the activities of users on their machines and over the Internet to predict future malware outbreaks. Our solution estimates the risk for different classes of malware, enabling organizations to proactively implement mitigation strategies tailored to their risk profiles. We deploy our implementation in a real-world setting and conduct a large-scale risk study across 10.7 million endpoints collected over a period of one month. Our empirical study provides insights on the behaviors that most significantly put users at risk, the categories of endpoints that are most vulnerable to specific malware, the distribution mechanisms used to operate malware campaigns, among other findings we share with the community."

While PBL self-efficacy scores were slightly higher (at both times of semester), the effect was not significant. However, students in PBL sections demonstrated significantly higher intent to continue in engineering compared to baseline students. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect indicated that while intent to continue scores decreased over the semester in baseline courses, they remained stable in PBL sections. Our results add to evidence for positive outcomes with PBL and may encourage others to implement similar changes."

Unlike diffusion-reliant optical sensors, our design transduces pH via rapid polymer strain, achieving a sub-15-second response— four times faster than typical hydrogel-based sensors. The key innovation lies in a dual-optimization of etching and coating processes, secured by a silane coupling agent that eliminates PANI adhesion issues. This results in great stability: a minimal signal drift (RSD <5.5%) over 10 days, extending the sensor’s lifespan by orders of magnitude compared to its non-silane counterparts. Such a design introduces an innovative technological framework for the creation of dependable real-time pH monitoring systems, holding significant potential for applications in environmental surveillance and the biomedical sector."

The main focus is to conduct comprehensive studies on effective professional development programs to bridge the gaps in computer science education. Recognizing the lack of rigorous CS courses at the middle and high school levels, particularly due to the lack of qualified teachers, we examine professional development (PD) programs considering university partnerships, mentoring, sustained expertise, curriculum development, and nurturing local professional communities among educators. The study demonstrates that embedded professional development, delivered within the school environment, offers sustained mentorship, hands-on engagement with CS teaching practices, and consistent support that strengthens teacher confidence and instructional skills. Embedded PD programs improved teacher content knowledge and instructional skills, while also promoting higher levels of student participation and achievement in computer science. This work shows the importance of integrating embedded PD programs in pre-college CS education and proposes a collaborative professional development model with recommendations for structuring effective and scalable programs that promote CS for all."

To address these challenges, previous work introduced SeaSentry, a passive shore-based sensor network designed to detect and monitor vessels. The placement of sensors within the network significantly impacts the accuracy of vessel localization and tracking, as both the number and spatial configuration of sensors determine positioning performance. This study proposes a grid-based search for optimizing sensor placement in scan-based vessel localization. A network of fixed sensors is analyzed to identify the optimal positions for additional sensors, using the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to quantify the minimum achievable localization error. Experiments conducted in the Neuburgweier region of Germany demonstrate the potential of the proposed grid-based search approach to establish a robust optimization technique for practical deployment. The findings also underscore the importance of strategic sensor placement and validate the approach through empirical results."

    "abstract": "The operation of solar panels is highly dependent on environmental conditions to provide a reliable power source. Temperature is one of the important ecological factors that directly affect the performance of solar panels, as higher operating temperatures reduce efficiency. In this study, two active cooling systems were applied to solar panels: water and air cooling using a heatsink and fan. The aim was to analyze the efficiency by comparing the energy produced by the panels with the energy consumed by the cooling systems. The results showed that solar panels equipped with a cooling system improved the operating efficiency compared to those without cooling. Among the tested methods, solar panels equipped with a heatsink and fan demonstrated the highest average operational efficiency, reaching 17.912%, followed by the water-cooling system, which achieved 17.832%. In contrast, solar panels without a cooling system showed the lowest average efficiency of 17.161%, highlighting the important role of thermal management in panel performance. However, when considering net energy output, the water-cooling system produced the highest net energy production, which was approximately 518.501 Wh, representing a 2.887% increase compared to the uncooled panel (503.951 Wh). In contrast, although the heatsink system improved instantaneous efficiency, its higher energy consumption resulted in a net energy output of only 455.900 Wh, which is 9.535% lower than that of the uncooled panel. These findings suggest that while active cooling improves solar panel performance, the choice of cooling method must consider both efficiency and energy consumption improvements to maximize net energy production."

    "abstract": "The emergence of sixth-generation mobile communication networks (6G) marks a paradigm shift toward native artificial intelligence (AI) architectures, where AI is deeply embedded in the network infrastructure. At the core of this transformation is End-to-End (E2E) AI, which enables autonomous monitoring, orchestration, and reasoning across distributed AI workloads. A key enabler of scalable E2E AI is split learning, where deep neural networks are partitioned across edge and cloud nodes to meet the performance and efficiency demands of 6G applications. However, the reliability of split learning is particularly vulnerable to performance degradation arising from communication delays, resource dynamics, and model drift. These issues pose significant challenges that traditional monitoring and maintenance techniques fail to address effectively. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a Large Models Empowered Proactive Maintenance Framework tailored for split learning in native AI future networks. The framework integrates Large Forecasting Models (LFMs) for continuous segment-level performance monitoring and Large Language Models (LLMs) for root cause reasoning and adaptive recovery planning. By aligning with the principles of E2E AI, the proposed system enables anticipatory anomaly detection, interpretable diagnosis, and automated corrective actions, thus enhancing the resilience, scalability, and autonomy of AI-native 6G networks. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's ability to maintain stable split model performance under dynamic system conditions, offering a practical path toward intelligent and self-sustaining AI service delivery in next-generation networks."

Moreover, the incremental algorithms for -R/-F on non-stationary batch stream are derived, featuring recursive weight updates and variable learning rates. Compared to -R, we recommend -F which improves learning performance using future unlabeled observations while further reducing online regrets to offline global experts. Additionally, we conduct a detailed analysis and theoretically derive relative cumulative regret bounds of the Randomized NN learners for -R/-F under adversarial assumptions via a novel methodology and present several corollaries, from which we observed the superiority in online learning acceleration and declined regret bounds of employing -F in IOL. Finally, our proposed methods were rigorously examined across diverse tasks, from simulation, regression, and classification tasks, to long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) and continual learning (CL) fields, which distinctly validated the efficacy of the IOL frameworks and the advantages of forward regularization."

    "abstract": "Existing donation platforms suffer from limited transparency, centralized governance, and minimal donor participation in fund allocation decisions. Donors often lack visibility into how their contributions are used and have no role in prioritizing charitable projects. These shortcomings undermine trust and reduce engagement. In this paper, a DAObased blockchain donation system is proposed to address these challenges by enabling decentralized, transparent, and automated governance. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using Ganache, MetaMask, and Solidity smart contracts, the system allows verified donors to vote on project prioritization. Smart contracts autonomously execute fund distribution based on vote proportions, removing administrative discretion. The platform consists of eight functional modules, developed using Agile methodology, and implements key DAO features such as token-based eligibility, one-person-one-vote enforcement, and trustless execution. Functional testing validated 24 key system features, while security tests confirmed strong password policies, MetaMask-based identity, and reCAPTCHA protection. User acceptance testing with total 20 donors and 15 administrators resulted in satisfaction scores of 4–5 on a 5-point Likert scale. This research demonstrates how DAO principles can be applied to real-world philanthropic ecosystems, transforming donation systems from passive funding channels into participatory, community-governed platforms."

The identification of the EMS in the form of multidimensional transient characteristics is performed using data from identification “input-output” experiments, which involve test visual stimuli and innovative eye-tracking technology. Experimental studies of the respondent’s EMS were conducted for the psychophysiological states “Normal” and “Fatigue”. To determine the first- and second-order transient characteristics, the least squares method was applied to the responses of the EMS to step test signals of different amplitudes. The variability of the EMS transient characteristics for different psychophysiological states was assessed. For the classification of psychophysiological states, diagnostic feature spaces were constructed: a heuristic feature space and a feature space based on the sampling of transient characteristics. Machine learning datasets were generated. The most informative robust feature pairs were identified based on the probability of correct recognition (PCR) criterion for state classification using the Bayesian method, achieving PCR values of up to 93.75% for Respondent 1 and up to 95.24% for Respondent 2. For the first time, an adequate quadratic EMS model was constructed using three test signals of different amplitudes, which provides a simplified model structure, reduced identification error, and enables the formation of informative features for the classification of psychophysiological states."

This paper aims to develop a machine learning based model to classify different types of chillis found in a particular region. In this study, a collection of 50 image data sets for five chili types-Bhut jolokia, Kashmiri red chili, Guntur Sannam chili, Jalapeno, and cayenne have been grouped by a supervised learning task. Specifically, the Random Forest algorithm is used, where the model is trained to differentiate between types of chilis based on their visual characteristics, for example, shape, color and texture thus achieving an accuracy of 93.12 %. The high consumption of chilies is likely to contribute to the usage of herbicides, pesticides and other chemicals in the farms rain causing the contamination of crops and endangering the health of consumers. As a result, this model integrates both aspects, that is, it not only does chili variety classification but also examines the normal conditions under which chili crop production is done and the diseases that affect chilies during production, the pesticides used and the effects after the consumption of the products. For example the Kashmiri Chili variety suffers from damping off disease which is generally treated with the use of copper oxychloride 50 % W and Mancozeb, the side effects include the risk of thyroid dysfunction, skin and eyes irritations, and nervous system disorders as a result of exposure to Mancozeb. By complementing classification with essential information on agriculture, it is hoped that this system will act against consumer health threats."

Research indicates that STEM methods courses are often taught in isolation, providing future elementary teachers with limited opportunities to experience integrated STEM (iSTEM) teaching and learning. Moreover, studies suggest that future elementary teachers have limited knowledge about engineering design and its possible connection to science, mathematics, and/or technology. In this WIP paper, we address these limitations through our STEM methods semester. Our innovative practice lies in the design of this STEM methods semester, in which about 80 elementary PSTs are enrolled in science, innovative learning technologies, and mathematics methods courses. For the preliminary evaluation of this innovative practice, we utilize content analysis to examine elementary PSTs' reflections about their experiences with iSTEM teaching and learning. Results from this WIP will inform the revision of course assignments as well as future course activities and topics to better support future elementary teachers in implementing iSTEM."

    "abstract": "To effectively manage classification and prioritization in medical emergency assistance, this study proposes a machine learning (ML)–driven functional chain scheduling framework for health medical information networks. Medical emergency services are classified into four categories based on urgency level and service area, with corresponding priority weights assigned. A system architecture integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is designed to support dynamic and scalable service deployment. To minimize the total weighted completion time, a scheduling optimization model is formulated. For different problem scales, two complementary ML-based algorithms are employed: a Matching Game algorithm for small-scale instances and a Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm for large-scale, dynamic scenarios. The Q-learning model adaptively optimizes scheduling policies through continuous interaction with network states and service demands, enhancing real-time decision-making efficiency. Simulation results show a reduction of up to 26.6% in total weighted completion time for small-scale problems using the Matching Game approach and up to 40 % improvement for large-scale problems with Q-learning compared to traditional heuristic algorithms. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ML-driven framework in achieving accurate service prioritization, optimal resource utilization, and rapid emergency response, providing a foundation for intelligent and adaptive smart healthcare infrastructures."

    "abstract": "Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) records are fundamental to cybersecurity, offering unique identifiers for publicly known software and system vulnerabilities. Each CVE is typically assigned a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to support risk prioritization and remediation. However, score inconsistencies often arise due to subjective interpretations of certain metrics. As the number of new CVEs continues to grow rapidly, automation is increasingly necessary to ensure timely and consistent scoring. While prior studies have explored automated methods, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent popularity, remains relatively underexplored.In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in generating CVSS scores for newly reported vulnerabilities. We investigate various prompt engineering strategies to enhance their accuracy and compare LLM-generated scores against those from embedding-based models, which use vector representations classified via supervised learning. Our results show that while LLMs demonstrate potential in automating CVSS evaluation, embedding-based methods outperform them in scoring more subjective components, particularly confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts. These findings underscore the complexity of CVSS scoring and suggest that combining LLMs with embedding-based methods could yield more reliable results across all scoring components."

    "abstract": "This study concentrates on the amalgamation of deep neural networks with a verifiable architecture that preserves gradient-based learning. We will also employ Conceptual Alignment Layers (CAL) and Differentiable Logic Graphs (DLG) for this. The goal of these research pathways is to create a neural-symbolic system. You may use CAL to turn symbolic operators like AND, OR, and NOT into their continuous versions when you train a relational network. These operators will always be able to talk to each other as long as this goes on. Another beneficial feature about CAL is that it makes representations of ideas more stable, which makes it less likely that semantic drift will develop. The technique outperforms the best methods on twelve distinct assessment criteria, demonstrating a high degree of conceptual quality and logical coherence. Some of the things being looked at include how accurate, consistent, resilient, scalable, and easy to understand they are. In many circumstances, our method works well. For example, when used jointly, it is 99.3% accurate, and when used independently, it is 99.0% accurate. At the end of the operation, we got the following concept metrics: F1 = <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$92.8 \\%, C K A=0.87, T C A V$</tex> directionality <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.79$</tex>, prototype purity <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.92$</tex>, and inter-concept <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$M I=0.11$</tex>. It not only keeps the F1 value high, but it also keeps the calibration error lower than the present baselines. This is done to make sure that CAL is still dependable when it comes to new concepts. You can still acquire the performance you need by employing trimming and modularization, even when symbolic restrictions make calculations much more expensive. The results show that there is always a trade-off between keeping prediction accuracy high and coping with scenarios that need a lot of data and change fast, even if the rules are straightforward to follow."

Specifically, we explore the similarities and differences in these experiences based on gender. The research question addressed in this study is: “How do high school students experience engineering projects, and in what ways are these experiences similar or different across genders?“ Student surveys were conducted from 2019 to 2023 annually to evaluate the curriculum and understand students' experiences in early engineering classes. This study focuses on analyzing the open-ended responses of 296 high school students from 33 schools across 20 states in the academic year 2022 -23, using thematic analysis. The analysis revealed a set of themes that have gender-based trends in engagement with engineering projects. Both male and female students emphasized the value of hands-on learning, collaboration, and creativity. Notably, female students more frequently explained the real-world applications, while male students showed a stronger focus on technical tools and autonomous problem-solving. Also, female students valued practical, socially relevant projects and the creative process of design; whereas male students expressed greater interest in utilizing technologies and seemed to value outcomes of creativity. These results have implications for the broader engineering community to create more meaningful and inclusive pre-college engineering experiences."

The other limitation is the choice of waveguide core materials for designing various passive and active components for the application specific PICs. Fortunately, besides crystalline Si, plenty of other options of waveguide core materials such as epitaxially grown Ge, PECVD/LPCVD grown SiN, AlN, etc., are available for the utilization of advanced CMOS fabrication process compatible silicon photonics technology in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. However, because of the absence of a suitably designed optical via, hybrid structure waveguide components and multi-layered three-dimensional PIC designs couldn't be effectively implemented till date. Here, we have proposed a low-loss compact optical tunnel via (OTV) design as a solution for 3D photonic integration. Using a standard Maxwell's equation solver, we have shown that the insertion loss of such a OTV design can be <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$&lt; $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.1dB for a broad wavelength range of operations around 1550nm. We have also shown low-loss performance of such OTVs can be arrayed in designing complex PICs with hybrid waveguide components. The materials and design dimensions have been chosen carefully such that the proposed 3D-PICs can be easily manufactured in conventional CMOS foundries. We have also presented wavelength dependent loss (WDL) and polarization dependent loss (PDL) of various OTV designs for hybrid photonic interconnects using 3D-FDTD simulations."

Collaborative work is essential in computing and engineering, given the scope and complexity of the projects within these fields. However, little is known about how to cultivate this disposition in the undergraduate classroom. The motivation of this research is to identify the categories of behaviors that students associate with being collaborative. The research questions for this study are: 1) What do students describe as collaborative practices applied to their coursework? and 2) What do students report as factors that prevent them from being collaborative? In computing courses at three institutions, students were asked to complete programming assignments and complete a reflection prompt after each assignment that asked “Describe an example of you being collaborative when completing this assignment. Otherwise, describe the circumstances that prevented you from being collaborative”. Responses were qualitatively/thematically analyzed resulting in the identification of ten categories of collaborative behaviors and nine categories of factors that impeded collaborative behavior. The significance of the study is that it deepens understanding of the collaborative disposition and identifies conditions that promote or discourage it. The results of this work will help educators design classroom interventions that will facilitate the development of the collaborative disposition among computing and engineering students."

    "abstract": "Chronic malnutrition during early childhood often leads to stunting, a critical public health issue across Indonesia. Specifically in Pemalang Regency, 2023 data indicate a prevalence rate of 15.3%. To address this, the present research constructs a Machine Learning (ML) framework designed to accurately classify stunting cases within this specific demographic. The primary contribution of this work is the implementation of a robust pipeline that combines Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) with systematic hyperparameter tuning. This approach specifically addresses the challenge of extreme class imbalance to improve sensitivity to minority stunting cases. Performance evaluation was conducted using the Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms, with StandardScaler for normalization. The dataset exhibited a severe 9:1 imbalance, with 9,915 normal samples and only 1,045 stunting cases. Initial experiments on the imbalanced data yielded high accuracy (up to 97.99%) but failed to capture the minority class effectively, resulting in poor F1-scores (approximately 41-44% for KNN). However, integrating SMOTE significantly improved metric performance across all models. The optimized Random Forest model achieved superior results on the balanced dataset, attaining 96.94% accuracy, 88.00% precision, 78.00% recall, and an F1-score of 83.00%. These findings confirm that pairing data balancing techniques with model optimization is the most effective strategy for reliable stunting detection in the region."

    "abstract": "The rise of electronic communication has led to an increased amount of junk emails, thereby making spam a serious cyber security threat. Specifically, in the Indonesian scenario, it is difficult to identify spams due to its nature of containing Indonesian language in an English format, making it easier to evade filters. Conventional Machine Learning Models may find it difficult to identify such trends and may not be flexible enough to adapt to new trends of spams. To overcome this problem, this research proposes the application of text-based spam classifiers designed by applying Long Short-Term Memory with Attention Mechanism. The proposed model was then tested with an Indonesian dataset of 2,617 clean emails, split with an 80-20 ratio of train and testing set. From the experimental findings, it has been seen that by implementing Attention Mechanism in LSTM, one can achieve better accuracy with improved sensitivity and stronger context, with an accuracy of 97.75% and above 97% Precision, Recall, and F1 score respectively, thereby making it more viable and effective with new advances in advanced email security systems."

The optical wireless, a free space optic (FSO) system, is connected to an optical wired network, a gigabit passive optical network for connecting two buildings. FSO underlays the GPON network, with the FSO output signal becoming the input signal for the GPON network can be a solution for interbuilding communication. This study discusses FSO feeders for GPON networks in a different building for communication within an institution. FSO transmission simulation within these buildings is carried out in a simulation. The FSO scheme is proposed in three free space propagations: clear sky, rain, and fog. The worst condition of fog-free space propagation is chosen for moderate attenuation to determine the maximum distance between two buildings. The visibility is also included for fog attenuation. The simulation results show FSO works reliably up to 600 m in clear-sky, 600 m for rain, and 540 m for fog weather. On the access side, the GPON network still provides BER standards. The simulation standard references are ITU-T G.984.2 for GPON, and ITU-R P.1817, F.2106-1 for FSO. The performance of both networks conforms to the ITU standards."

This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for integrating advanced data analytics approaches with personalised persuasive technology interventions. Drawing from behaviour change theories, computational persuasion models, and machine learning paradigms, we propose a multidimensional analytical framework that addresses the personalisation challenge through dynamic user modelling, contextual adaptation, and temporal optimisation. Our theoretical contribution synthesises insights from the COM-B behavioural model, reinforcement learning theory, and predictive analytics to establish a foundation for developing adaptive persuasive systems. The framework provides significant theoretical gaps to understand how data-driven methods could improve the effectiveness of personalised persuasive systems. In the meantime, while keeping scalability and dealing with ethical challenges. This paper gives a systematic theoretical framework for making personalised persuasive systems that can adapt to complex patterns of human behaviour."

These advancements have enabled users from diverse backgrounds to access complex datasets through simple natural language inquiries. Using only natural language, users can interact with data fetching services without needing to understand their underlying technical implementation. Our project takes root in such an ever-changing environment and addresses the long-standing necessity of an indoor localisation system in medium-to-large buildings, such as offices or schools. We will present the potential of our architecture, achieved via a state-of-the-art implementation of a mesh communication network between ESP32 microcontrollers based on advanced technologies such as LoRa, Bluetooth Low Energy and the framework Hermes. Pursuing maximum adaptability, the whole application has also been modelled over the BDI paradigm, given its superb information hiding capabilities and ease of understanding. To facilitate the process, a specialised custom library called DEMOCLE was fine-tuned and employed, which enables distributed knowledge programming on embedded devices. Finally, user interaction is managed by a Large Language Model-based artificial intelligence, capable of translating human requests into SQL queries that precisely access the collected data to meet the inquirer’s needs."

    "abstract": "Educational data mining (EDM) has emerged as a critical field for leveraging academic data to improve decisionmaking in schools and support early interventions for at-risk students. Despite the availability of rich academic data, school counseling services often remain reactive, with interventions occurring only after performance declines, creating a gap for proactive early-warning systems. To address this, a Two-Layer Ensemble Progressive Learning model is proposed: the first layer integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) through weighted voting, while the second layer fuses inter-semester predictions to capture progression dynamics. Adaptive curriculum features covering curriculum-alignment behavior and knowledgedomain grouping are engineered to be readily replicable across schools, relying only on routinely collected curriculum and assessment records. On the aggregated evaluation set ($\\mathbf{N}=\\mathbf{2 4 0}$), we obtain micro-averaged Accuracy $=0.929$, Precision $=0.723$, Recall $=0.895, \\mathrm{~F} 1=0.800$, and $\\mathrm{ROC} \\mathrm{AUC}=0.902$. Under 10fold grouped, time-aware cross-validation, the ensemble achieves macro-averaged Recall $=0.912$ and $\\mathbf{F 1}=0.866$. The confusion matrix ($T P=34, F N=4, F P=13, T N=189$) highlights strong recall and low false negatives, which are critical for early interventions. This study makes three key contributions: a progressive ensemble that leverages inter-semester dynamics; adaptive curriculum features that are readily replicable across schools; and a practical implementation flow that enables school counselors to move from reactive to proactive intervention."

    "abstract": "Satellite-based communication systems are crucial for providing high-speed data services in aviation, particularly for business aviation operations that demand global connectivity. These systems face challenges from numerous interdependent factors, such as satellite handovers, congestion, flight maneuvers, and seasonal variations, making accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction complex. Currently, there is no established methodology for predicting QoS in avionic communication systems. This paper addresses this gap by proposing machine learning-based approaches for pre-flight QoS prediction. Specifically, we leverage transformer models to predict QoS along a given flight path using real-world data. The model takes as input a variety of positional and network-related features, such as aircraft location, satellite information, historical QoS, and handover probabilities, and outputs a predicted performance score for each position along the flight. This approach allows for proactive decision-making, enabling flight crews to select the most optimal flight paths before departure, improving overall operational efficiency in business aviation. Our proposed encoder-decoder transformer model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 65% and an RMSE of 1.91, representing a significant improvement over traditional baseline methods. While these metrics are notable, our model’s key contribution is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy for underrepresented classes, which were a major limitation of prior approaches. Additionally, the model significantly reduces inference time, achieving predictions in 40 seconds compared to 6,353 seconds for a traditional KNN model. This approach allows for proactive decision-making, enabling flight crews to select optimal flight paths before departure, improving overall operational efficiency in business aviation."

Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall, and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy, scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale, multi-tenant cloud-native environments."

Multiple agents can interact with each other and their environments, and the system is built on a general cloud. The agent controls data messaging, task migration, and duplication to manage key adaptation processes across robots and the cloud, and our adaptation manager controls the agent’s lifecycle, which includes creation, relocation, execution, and termination.

    "abstract": "Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) aims to identify sarcastic expressions by integrating multimodal and contextual cues to capture cross-modal semantic inconsistencies. However, existing studies face challenges: fine-grained sarcastic cues are implicit and dispersed, large generative models suffer from gradient vanishing in classification tasks, and cross-domain generalization remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose InterARM, an interpretable affective reasoning model that introduces a structured sarcasm reasoning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage training strategy based on curriculum learning, consisting of 1) sarcasm classification learning, 2) structured sarcasm reasoning learning, and 3) step-selective hierarchical reward reinforcement learning. The model generates reasoning chains across modalities to analyze sentiment polarity and semantic conflicts. We also construct the MSD-CoT dataset with 3,200 image-text pairs with 19,200 human-annotated reasoning steps. Experiments show that InterARM achieves superior performance on the in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, outperforming larger MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-7B and GPT-5-mini while maintaining high interpretability and strong cross-domain generalization."

Second, an IDR strategy balancing price incentives and carbon compensation is designed for end-users. Third, a multi-agent low-carbon operation mechanism based on carbon trading and game-theoretic cooperation is built, considering the decision-making abilities of entities like power generation, load, and energy storage, with decision-making models developed for all stakeholders.

Experimental validation was conducted using a constructed dual-spectrum image dataset containing 13,728 images. Results show that the proposed MD-TOOD model outperforms mainstream detection models in terms of mAP, particularly excelling in distinguishing morphologically similar faults (e.g., hot spots vs. soiling) and accurately localizing glare regions, thereby significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of PV power plant fault diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of cloud computing has changed how enterprises store, process and manage data. But the migration now also widens the attack vectors for cybersecurity threats leading to issues with data integrity, privacy and access in unauthorized manners. This work puts forward a blockchain based security framework to strengthen the security of cloud computing by protecting the integrity of product data and controlling access using smart contract rules. With blockchain-based decentralized, append-only, immutable ledger and smart contract programmability, the architecture supports secure data sharing, auditable trails, enforceable access rule automation that is not dependent on central parties. The blockchain works in the proposed system as trusted data infrastructure on which all transactions of crucial product data creation, request or update, are registered in an unchangeable way. The access to, as well as the modification of particular dataset is governed by smart contract living on blockchain, that enforce pre-defined access policies. This mitigates single-point of failures and insider attacks experienced by centralized cloud deployments. The framework is cloud-ready and is being gradually integrated with a penetration testing framework for cloud, as an overlay security layer. An anomaly detection with AI could be added to check access patterns and activate appropriate security procedures in case of suspicion. The blockchain-oriented architecture also enables distributed identity management, making it possible for enterprises to securely manage access control for identity across multi-cloud environments. Performance evaluation shows that our solution mitigates unauthorized accesses by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$40+\\%$</tex> while also making the auditing of the logs so much easier (because of the immutability) and compliance cost minimal (as smart contracts do the job of security checks). In addition, it supports cross-organization computing in cloud ecology while keeping the data privacy. This work tackles the challenge of keeping cloud computing scalable and flexible while providing strong cybersecurity. Leveraging blockchain's trust model with a programmable access control and data integrity verification, the platform provides a secure, transparent, and a self-regulating cybersecurity infrastructure for cloud infrastructure. The proposed framework can be directly extended to any domain including manufacturing, healthcare and supply chain management where secure product data handling is a necessity."

    "abstract": "Human-machine communication is becoming more and more complicated, which requires conversational agents that will be able to constantly improve themselves and be aware of the situation. The conventional models of dialogue are based on fine-tuning that is not dynamic and they do not have any means of long-term adaptation in the process of real-life communication. This paper attempts to overcome this drawback by presenting a novel dynamic meta learning network named Cognitive Gradient Modulation Network (CGMN) - which enables the autonomous learning of conversational behavior. CGMN encompasses a Meta-Cognition Engine to trace linguistic consistency, a Gradient Modulation Layer to do localized parameter change-offs and an Evolutionary Memory Bank that maintains the history of context adaptation. The model uses user sentiment, coherence pattern, and task performance metrics through a Cognitive Feedback Reinforcement loop to improve the model dialogue strategies as a running record. CGMN uses lightweight gradient gating, opposed to the use of traditional retraining-based techniques, to allow efficient real-time fine tuning. The proposed model is tested experimentally to illustrate that the model has a high adaptability, long-term consistency, and the entropy of responses is less than in baseline transformer-based agents. All in all, CGMN provides a platform to build some self-regulating conversational systems that develop with the interaction of the user, forming the transition between a fixed large language model and a fully autonomous cognitive dialogue system. The suggested CGMN attained an overall accuracy of 95.6 percent, exhibiting enhanced flexibility and precision relative to current conversations models."

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress research-to-practice study examines how different instructional contexts influence the effectiveness of teaching engineering students learning strategies. Self-regulated learning is a vital skill for lifelong learning, particularly in the engineering profession, where rapid technological advancements require continuous adaptation. Although self-regulated learning is essential, explicit teaching of learning strategies for self-regulation is not standard in traditional engineering classrooms. Lack of targeted metacognitive training can impact students' ability to study effectively and master complex concepts. Factors such as limited instructional time and resources often hinder the integration of valuable learning interventions in practice. In this study, we examine how instructional contexts influence the transferability of knowledge gained from learning interventions. Using evidence-based learning strategies such as active recall, spaced learning, and knowledge organization, we implemented an intervention across three distinct instructional settings: a self-enrolled workshop, a guest lecture in a student success course, and a series of integrated lessons and assignments in a junior-level engineering classroom. Transferability was assessed using a pre-intervention survey and a follow-up survey administered 3 to 12 months later, measuring whether students integrated the strategies into their study routines and identifying which strategies were most effectively adopted across instructional contexts. Preliminary data suggests that teaching learning strategies within the context of an engineering classroom can provide the highest transferability. However, delivering it in a workshop specifically targeting engineering students can also be a viable pathway for learning strategies such as active recall. This work provides insight into alternative pathways for effectively integrating learning skills into engineering students' education. While preliminary results show varying transferability, it can help administrators and faculty better understand trade-offs when introducing learning interventions."

This study evaluates a range of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for phishing detection using three datasets: phishing-only, legitimate-only, and a balanced merged dataset. The experiments were carried out using centralized and FL approaches, with further robustness evaluation under adversarial scenarios such as phishing injection and label-flipping attacks. The results demonstrate that DL models, particularly LSTM and MLP, delivered strong performance in both stand-alone and ensemble setups. Notably, FL models preserved comparable performance and even slightly better accuracy than centralized models, while enhancing privacy, scalability, and robustness. Under adversarial scenarios, FL models maintained high robustness, validating the practical effectiveness of privacy-preserving phishing detection in real-world environments. In centralized settings, LSTM achieved up to 96.00% accuracy on phishing data, while heterogeneous DL ensembles (LSTM, MLP, CNN) further enhanced performance to 97.13%. This advantage was especially evident during crossdistribution evaluations, where LSTM bagging showed strong generalization, achieving up to 85.73% accuracy. In federated settings, LSTM models reached up to 86.75% accuracy and an F1-score around 86%. Even under phishing injection and data poisoning attacks, the 10-client LSTM model showed the best balance with 83.33% accuracy, 85.67% F1-score, and the highest AUC of 91.40%. The 10-client CNN and 15-client MLP models also performed well, with accuracies around 83.7% and F1-scores above 85.5%, with MLP reaching an AUC of 91.13%."

    "abstract": "This innovative practice paper falls under the Innovative Teaching and Learning track and focuses on improving graduate student retention in an online software engineering master's program (MSCS-SE) designed for career changers through the use of a novel onboarding process. The MSCS-SE, launched in 2021, targets students without a computer science or mathematics undergraduate degree Traditionally, many such students have struggled with the program's fast-paced introductory programming course. We developed an onboarding scheme to support student success featuring a Master Skills Profiler (MSP) placement exam and a foundational programming course. The MSP helps students assess their overall initial skill levels in programming and mathematical foundations. Based on the results, students receive tailored course recommendations. Those identified as needing additional preparation are encouraged to take a Basic Programming and Discrete Mathematics course, which fills knowledge gaps but does not count toward degree credits. To further support students, a tuition waiver was introduced for those placed into this preparatory course. This approach encourages students to make an informed decision rather than self-assessing into an overly challenging course, ultimately improving retention and program success. Retention data from multiple cohorts indicate that the onboarding scheme improved student persistence. Initial findings show that students who followed the placement recommendations were more likely to successfully complete the first programming course and, ultimately, the program. The tuition waiver further increased enrollment in the preparatory course, ensuring students had the necessary foundation. Future work includes a deeper longitudinal analysis of student outcomes and expanding the approach to other graduate programs."

    "abstract": "The rapid commerce platforms have transformed city retailing through the delivery of groceries and other necessities within a few minutes, which requires highly accurate demand forecasting and last-mile logistics. To overcome the drawbacks of the previous models, which could not describe the complicated spatial and time interactions, a graph-based predictive model of Blinkit, which is one of the leading Q-commerce providers, was developed. Spatio-temporal graphs of large-scale transactional records and real-time rider mobility data were modelled as a multi-layer and analyzed as a Graph Neural Network with predictive analytics. The efficiency of transportation was determined by using SUMO-based urban network simulation. The proposed system attained an absolute error in the demand forecasting mean of 2.7 %, an F1-score of 0.93 on surge detection, and an average error on delivery time of 3.5 minutes. The simulation outcomes also showed that it will utilize 86 % of its fleet, a maximum congestion index of 0.48, and the emission of carbon per delivery is 24 % less. These results prove the capability of the framework to contribute to the efficiency of quick-commerce and enable sustainable consumer-oriented operations."

Explainable artificial intelligence frameworks such as SHAP and LIME try to create interpretation and transparency for predictive modeling; however, our research reveals that an overwhelming majority of attempts at XAI come from one untested framework. We fill the gap with a dual-framework validated approach with global and local explanations to sustain a reasonable understanding of churn predictors. This research creates the state-of-the-art ML-XAI field with a path toward enhanced predictability and transparency for actionable results in prediction for churn."

This enables a unified, nonrecursive controller design that requires only three NNs regardless of the system order, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and facilitating practical implementation. Furthermore, this work overcomes a critical theoretical deficiency in existing simplified RL strategies, where the vanishing minimum eigenvalue of the NN basis function correlation matrix often leads to invalid Lyapunov stability analysis. A novel critic–actor weight update law is designed to bypass this problematic matrix, rigorously guaranteeing the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system without requiring persistent excitation (PE) conditions. Simulation results on a representative example demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach compared with existing methods."

    "abstract": "Flapping-Wing Aerial Vehicles (FWAVs) offer unique advantages over traditional fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, including superior maneuverability, energy efficiency, and the capability to navigate through cluttered environments. These features make them highly promising for applications in reconnaissance, search, rescue, and exploration of confined spaces. However, many designs cannot morph or fold their wings, significantly restricting their adaptability during flight. Without active morphing, these vehicles struggle to optimize their wing configurations for different flight modes, reducing overall efficiency and agility. Additionally, many of them are designed with synchronized wing motions, preventing independent control of the left and right wings or variations in flapping amplitudes, which further limits their dynamic performance and maneuverability. To overcome these challenges, a biologically inspired FWAV, KRoSwan, featuring an active folding-wing mechanism, is developed. This system employs servo motors as direct-drive actuators, enabling simultaneous control of both flapping and folding motions. This novel approach significantly enhances the degrees of freedom in wing movement, granting improved agility and adaptability. The methodology involves designing the robotic platform, formulating its dynamic and aerodynamic models, and conducting extensive flight tests to validate its performance. This research advances the development of FWAVs by integrating active wing morphing and independent wing control, paving the way for more agile, adaptable, and efficient bio-inspired aerial robots."

However, in mission-critical consumer applications such as smart cities, a major challenge lies in designing a computational architecture that combines deployment flexibility with domain-specific expertise, enabling continuous self-evolution and collaborative decision-making based on dynamic sensing data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical cognitive architecture. The framework adopts a project-based methodology, where project engineers can autonomously construct systems by selecting utilities from a utility panel that integrates physical models, data-driven models, and AI models. The system’s intelligence is powered by federated knowledge engine, which coordinates a set of domain-specific fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), and orchestrates their collaboration through a multi-agent workflow to execute complex tasks. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that, compared with several general-purpose LLMs, our fine-tuned model under our approach exhibits a significantly lower frequency of moderate-to-severe hallucinations in the water resources engineering domain. These findings validate the feasibility of constructing a federated knowledge engine. Furthermore, this work provides a robust and scalable platform for developing next-generation consumer-grade AIS that require high reliability and physical interpretability."

However, under the influence of a high proportion of renewable energy, fundamental flaws are gradually exposed. Existing scenario selection methods are easily dominated by conventional operating scenarios and difficult to capture low probability near limit conditions caused by sudden changes in new energy output and extreme weather. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing technical fields, this paper proposes a near limit boundary power system scenario selection method based on Gaussian mixture probability model. The Gaussian mixture model is used to perform probability clustering on high-dimensional data, and the posterior probability screening model is combined with the overlapping transition regions and Mahalanobis distance quantification of statistical risks near the limit. The two work together to achieve bidirectional coupling between the probability model and optimization control, accurately characterizing the near limit boundaries of the new power system and effectively generating high-dimensional feature scenarios."

    "abstract": "Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) comprise heterogeneous components that engage with both the physical environment and human activities. These components function synergistically to deliver diverse capabilities that enhance human life, the operation of physical systems, and ecosystems. CPSs, particularly Industrial Control Systems (ICS), have frequently been targeted by cyberattacks due to their substantial reliance on technological interconnectivity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), along with vulnerabilities arising from security misconfigurations and human factors. Comprehensive CPS risk management should encompass assessments of both physical and functional safety and cybersecurity. Thus, this document introduces a quantifiable and inclusive cybersecurity and safety risk assessment (ICSRA) model employing the Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System. The assessed risk using the proposed model indicates that insiders, among other risk factors, present the most significant cybersecurity and safety threat in CPS due to their potential to manipulate operational usability and their physical presence within the OT segment. The proposed ICSRA has also demonstrated superior accuracy, achieving 90% in listing the most analogous threats in ICS as reported by a trusted solution provider, when compared to existing quantitative risk models."

To mitigate these risks, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has been widely explored, allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption. However, HE introduces substantial computational and communication overhead, limiting its practical feasibility. To address this challenge, this work presents SlidHE, an efficient technique that integrates packing and packet sparsification methods with various selection strategies to significantly reduce overhead while preserving privacy and maintaining model accuracy, even in heterogeneous (non-IID) data settings.

We performed a systematic literature review, which identified 90 studies that aligned with our eligibility criteria. The analysis systematically compared the learning modalities by deriving qualitative insights into their characteristics, effectiveness, and applicability; it also explored their suitability for different learning stages and strategies to facilitate transitions, ultimately uncovering best practices and identifying areas for improvement. UL can improve the understanding of computational concepts and basic algorithms. VBP improves conceptual understanding in more complex and challenging topics. Secondary school is the most common stage for initiating the VBP-to-TBP transition, with dual presentation being the most used modality. While VBP helps reduce programming misconceptions during this phase. Challenges remain regarding teachers' limited programming knowledge and tools' accessibility."

In recent years, extensive research has focused on identifying the factors that influence students' early interest in STEM fields, ultimately guiding their college major choices related to these fields. Given the extensive literature on the topic, a synthesis of the findings is warranted. This paper reviews and synthesizes these findings using the lens of Social Cognitive Career Theory, and addresses the following research questions: 1) What factors influence interest in STEM fields in K-12 students? and 2) What factors influence the choice of STEM fields in undergraduate students? We searched for articles that investigated factors influencing STEM interest and choice across four databases: Education Source, ERIC, IEEE Xplore, and ASEE Peer. Based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, we shortlisted 27 articles. A thematic analysis of the articles revealed that for K12 students, social influences, learning and motivational factors, such as performance and self-efficacy beliefs, as well as identitybased factors like gender and first-generation status, were influential in developing STEM interests. For undergraduate students, influential factors in the choice of STEM majors included prior exposure, social influences, outcome expectations, and personal interest. These findings can inform educators and researchers working to enhance retention and recruitment in STEM fields. This review highlights the factors that are instrumental in designing effective interventions to increase students' interest in STEM, emphasizing the role of community and positive learning experiences."

Driven by rapid AI technology development and recognizing that traditional lectures often fail to address individualized learning gaps, educators from these disciplines implemented innovative AI practices, utilizing key tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google NotebookLM. These approaches support technical, operational, and strategic learning objectives by tailoring experiences, designing dynamic in-class activities, preparing comprehensive quiz reviews, and generating realistic scenarios that bridge theories with practical applications. In Computer Architecture, for instance, instructors utilized the POSED framework (Plan, Outline, Sources, Evaluation, Draft) to efficiently create and refine teaching materials while rapidly incorporating student feedback. At the same time, Google NotebookLM offered personalized support through lecture summarization and quiz generation. Built on prior research in AI-based tutoring and constructivist pedagogies, this framework extends traditional applications by incorporating agentic AI and personalized learning pathways. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated AI technology, a survey-based study revealed those integrations increased student engagement and enhanced comprehension of complex topics. However, the evaluation also indicates varied acceptance levels, with concerns regarding the optimal pacing of AI integration, the necessity for robust ethical oversight, and the ongoing challenge of maintaining a balance between AI support and instructor-led guidance. The findings offer actionable strategies for educators to align AI functionalities with pedagogical goals, providing insights into scalable, interdisciplinary AI-enhanced teaching practices.

Reflection is a crucial tool for developing students' professional growth and effectiveness as engineering educators. Nevertheless, graduate engineering students frequently struggle to reflect meaningfully by connecting educational theories with teaching experiences. In this study, concept mapping is employed to scaffold students in reflecting their experiences. Data were obtained through concept maps and weekly written reflections. Content analysis is used to show how concept mapping shapes students' reflective progression. A coding scheme based on Kember's reflection framework was developed to identify reflective elements in student work. Preliminary analysis showed that students who constructed more complex concept maps—incorporating more key concepts and linking words—typically engaged in deeper levels of reflection. As time progressed, some students' concept maps grew more sophisticated, with a corresponding advancement in reflection depth from habitual action to understanding and reflection levels. The study contributes to both theoretical understanding of reflective practice development and practical approaches for preparing future engineering educators. Additionally, the findings could inform strategies to scaffold understanding of concepts and reflective practice in engineering education, with potential applications across STEM disciplines."

A four-phase methodology was developed: 1) Surveys and interviews; 2) Data analysis; 3) Definition and development of digital competencies; and 4) Reporting and dissemination of results. To gather the necessary data, two steps were undertaken: 1) Administration of questionnaires to 132 students, and 2) Conducting interviews with 10 faculty members and 5 employers from small and mediumsized enterprises in the region. The information collected was analyzed both separately and comparatively. The questionnaire design was based on international Digital competence frameworks proposed by leading scholars in the field. Interviews with faculty and employers were conducted at their workplaces to better understand their environments and enrich the responses with contextual insights. The interview design was supported by an analytical matrix that related digital usage to both substantive and operational functions of the graduate profile. Interview validation was carried out with two types of faculty members: part-time lecturers who teach specialized courses within the educational program, and full-time faculty (researchers) who are involved in research and development projects within productive sectors, besides their teaching responsibilities. The results of the study identified the digital competencies required to strengthen the student's graduate profile, comprising six key dimensions. The proposed digital competencies integrate students' digital skills, the criteria considered essential by faculty for effective learning, and the labor market demands identified by employers."

Millions of individuals suffer from upper limb mobility impairments. At the same time, hand-held electronic devices have become increasingly integral to daily life, spanning both professional and recreational activities. Typical computer mice require clickerbased input, which can lead to significant accessibility challenges for individuals with limited hand mobility. This paper demonstrates an assistive device for individuals with fine motor skill impairments. This lightweight <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(40 ~\\mathrm{g})$</tex>, body- wearable mouse alternative using Arduino and an MPU 9250 accelerometer and gyroscope enables cursor control and clicking via acceleration and tilt, allowing use with various body placements, such as the head, arm, or leg. Physical gestures are translated into computer inputs to eliminate physical buttons. These inputs are further analyzed and processed to reflect the functions of the mouse by coding. Students' reflections highlight that this PBL engages them in a real-world challenge. This hands-on project fosters interdisciplinary learning, problem-solving, and teamwork, allowing students to bridge theoretical concepts and real-world applications within microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and computer engineering. Furthermore, a mastery experience with a high level of autonomy enables students to gain strong self-efficacy."

    "abstract": "High-speed vision tasks have long been a challenge in computer vision. Recently, the spike camera has shown great potential in these tasks due to its high temporal resolution. Unlike traditional cameras, it emits asynchronous spike signals to capture visual information. However, under low-light conditions, spike signals becomehighly sparse, and the sparse spike streamseverely hinders theeffectiveness of existing spike-based methods in high-speed scenarios. To address this challenge,we introduce SS2DS, the first deep learning framework that enhances sparse spike streams into dense spike streams. SS2DS first estimates the spike firing frequency within sparse streams. Subsequently, the spike firing frequency is enhanced by a neural network. Finally, SS2DS decodes the enhanced spike stream from the enhanced spike firing frequency sequence. SS2DS can adjust the temporal distribution of sparse spike streams and improve the performance degradation of existing methods in low-light and high-speed scenarios. In order to evaluate sparse spikestream enhancement,we construct both synthetic and real sparse spike stream datasets. The real dataset iscollected in dynamic scenarios using the third-generation spike camera.By comparing the reconstruction results, enhanced spike streams achieve an average improvement of +0.78 MA, -18.42 BRISQUE, and -1.42 NIQE over sparse spike streams. Moreover, the enhanced spike streams also benefit other spike-based vision tasks, such as 3D reconstruction (+1.325 dB PSNR, +0.005 SSIM, and -0.01 LPIPS) and super-resolution (+0.63 MA, -13.67 BRISQUE, and -1.28 NIQE).

This work uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based customized chatbot using the Mindjoy application to provide students with precise and relevant responses. We customized the chatbot's capabilities by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and adding conversational constraints. This tailored chatbot was implemented in the CIT 21400 (Intro to Data Management) course to function as a tutor, enabling students to ask questions and receive customized answers within the context of their introductory database management curriculum. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted anonymous surveys based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT). TAM was used to assess the perceived usefulness and ease of use with respect to the adoption of this new technology by students, while SDT offered insights into how the chatbot supported students' choices in learning (autonomy), their confidence in understanding the concepts of the database (competence) and their participation in the course material (relatedness). The surveys aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI tutor in the undergraduate course and the overall value of the comprehensive AI experience for students. Results indicated positive outcomes across all evaluation criteria, reinforcing TAM's hypothesis that perceived usefulness enhances the adoption of this technology. Students also provided constructive feedback for further improving the chatbot, highlighting key areas such as enhanced contextual awareness and greater adaptability to complex queries, though findings are exploratory given the limited sample."

Although there have been various efforts to identify and measure engineering entrepreneurship competencies, limited research has focused on expanding the scope to encompass social entrepreneurship competencies. Therefore, in this paper, we address the following research question: What social entrepreneurship competencies complement traditional engineering entrepreneurship knowledge, skills, and attitudes? To answer this research question, we conducted a literature review on engineering entrepreneurship competency and social entrepreneurship competency. By synthesizing the literature on those two topics, we identified competencies that can complement traditional engineering entrepreneurship knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Through the integration of these competencies in engineering education, engineers can develop abilities to develop innovative and responsible solutions to various societal challenges, fostering a new generation of technically skilled and socially conscious professionals. Ultimately, the results of this study will guide educational initiatives aimed at nurturing socially responsible and entrepreneurial leaders within the engineering workforce."

    "abstract": "The transition from manual labor to automation, driven by Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0, has significantly transformed manufacturing. However, defects are still unavoidable in manufacturing, especially in the metal domain. To avoid substantial economic and reputational losses, defect detection is a must to guarantee long-term quality and durability of metal products. Despite high accuracy in defect detection, advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can optimize production processes, improve efficiency, and lower operational costs. This drives the emergence of AI agents, which are autonomous systems powered by advanced AI models to efficiently perform complex tasks. Thus, this paper is aimed to address the question of how LLMs and MLLMs can enhance defect detection efficiency and interpretability in Industry 5.0 manufacturing systems. To achieve this, a comparative and conceptual analysis is conducted among the studies applying LLMs and MLLMs in a workflow, in terms of data collection, models, and evaluation metrics. In addition, this paper also further studies the practical applications and limitations encountered among the studies."

    "abstract": "Online 3D panoptic segmentation has encountered difficulty in processing input point cloud in large scene scenarios due to the unordered nature of point cloud. It requires several stages of point clustering and grouping in order to extract meaningful object instances. In this paper, an incremental segmentation pipeline is proposed to achieve real time panoptic segmentation. The proposed pipeline consists of a SLAMbased reconstruction system and a point-based segmentation model. The reconstruction pipeline employs a SLAM pipeline combined with a pinhole camera model for RGB-D to point cloud reconstruction. The use of the pinhole model removes the need for per-scene training and fully leverages the depth maps to generate point cloud with rich geometric detail. The reconstructed partial point cloud is then fed into a transformerbased model for incremental panoptic segmentation. A pointfiltering process is introduced to remove high-confidence points by comparing the new input with the previous frame. The filtering process eliminates redundant data, resulting in a more effective segmentation process and faster inference speed."

    "abstract": "Owing to the incorporation of multimodal content, multimodal recommender systems contribute to powerful representation learning and promote personalized recommendations. However, most existing methods directly mix various modality embeddings and ID embeddings by element-wise sum as final representations. This strategy hardly distinguishes the importance of different representations and entangles the ID and modality effects, and thus is unable to fully leverage multimodal features to facilitate personalized recommendations. To address this problem, we design a meta-weight net to learn the relevance between pairwise embeddings (including modality embeddings and ID embeddings) from users and items, respectively. Specifically, the proposed model first performs graph convolutional networks to generate the modality and ID representations for users and items. For each type of user representation, we calculate its relevance weights with all types of item representations with the designed meta-weight net. Afterward, we utilize these relevance weights to adaptively integrate the corresponding probability scores to calculate the final recommendation result. Moreover, we adopt contrastive learning to alleviate the data sparsity issue and introduce the KL divergence constraint to better align user preferences and multimodal content. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than the state-of-the-art methods."

Human annotators evaluated and ranked the generated explanations, and their feedback was used to create a refined dataset. The generated dataset was then used to fine-tune a GPT-2 model, enabling it to produce context-aware and pedagogically relevant explanations.

Through the AHP method to calculate the weight of each indicator and arrive at the comprehensive evaluation results, shows that the manufacturing industry of Jiangmen City has demonstrated a high level of competitiveness in a number of dimensions. Among them, “industrial scale” and “industrial efficiency” are particularly outstanding, becoming the core competitiveness; “opening up” and “green environmental protection” have also achieved remarkable results. The “opening-up” and “green environmental protection” aspects have also achieved remarkable results and enhanced the comprehensive competitiveness. However, the score of the “innovation ability” dimension is relatively low, which has become a key bottleneck restricting its high-quality development. The findings of the study can provide theoretical support and policy suggestions for the Jiangmen manufacturing industry to optimize supply chain management, enhance competitiveness and achieve high-quality development."

    "abstract": "Electrostatically actuated mesh reflectors are a promising technology for space-based sensing and communication antennas. Key advantages over current passive mesh reflectors include the ability to correct surface distortions (e.g., from manufacturing defects and environmental disturbances) and to achieve beam steering and beam shaping via dynamic adjustment of the reflector surface. Implementation of an electrostatically actuated mesh requires a method for determining optimal control voltages that achieve a desired reflector shape. This work demonstrates such an inverse method using a simplified numerical model of a linear isotropic elastic membrane subject to nonlinear electrostatic pressure. The model is used to determine the number of electrodes required to achieve a desired surface error. A prototype reflector, consisting of a 0.5-m diameter gold mesh and 9 electrodes, is constructed and various reflector shapes, including non-axisymmetric ones, are produced and refined using an open-loop controller based on the method. Before refinement, the experimentally measured RMS surface error is within 840μm of the target shape. The method is also shown to be useful for fine-tuning the shape; with only 3 iterations of surface refinement, the RMS error is reduced to within 231 μm. The experimentally characterized surface error proves that the method can adapt to unmodeled mechanics, achieving the desired shape precision for operation at 35 GHz Ka-band. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations of the target and experimental reflector surfaces were performed, and it was found that the fine-tuned surfaces had sufficient surface precision for convergence of the main lobe of the antenna pattern. This work demonstrates both the viability of, and method for achieving, shape control of an electrostatically actuated reflector."

    "abstract": "This full research paper examines the impact of Educators Guidebook for Understanding Instruction by Design and Experience (EdGUIDE), a web-based software tool designed to guide instructors in creating aligned curricula. One of the features of the EdGUIDE tool aims to introduce the formulation of SMART learning objectives through a structured, three-step process based on Bloom's Taxonomy. We hypothesize that participants' application engagement (the amount of time spent with EdGUIDE) may impact their conceptual performance in creating SMART learning objectives. The primary research question guiding this investigation is: How does the participants' application engagement relate to the change in conceptual performance from pre-use to post-use of EdGUIDE? We employed a quantitative, correlational research design. We conducted Spearman's rank correlation and simple linear regression analyses to explore the relationship between application engagement and participants' conceptual performance with EdGUIDE. This paper examines the relationship between the learning objective creation process and the change in participants' conceptual performance from pre- to post-test. Our results found no statistically significant relationship between time spent and the change in test scores. The correlation values, however, suggest that participants become less engaged with each step of the learning objective creation process. The study suggests that improvements are needed to EdGUIDE's design, particularly in the process of creating learning objectives. Such changes may help to improve participants' application engagement and resulting performance. Future research should investigate the impact of such tools on instructors' stress and fatigue, and explore potential mechanisms to optimize EdGUIDE as an effective instructional design tool."

    "abstract": "The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) has introduced New Radio Vehicle-to-Everything (NR-V2X) as an evolution of Cellular V2X (C-V2X) to satisfy the increasingly stringent communication requirements of emerging V2X applications. In NR-V2X Mode 2, vehicles autonomously perform decentralized spectrum resource allocation via the Sensing-Based Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) algorithm. Nevertheless, the performance of SPS significantly degrades under scenarios with high vehicle density and aperiodic traffic patterns, which hinders the system’s ability to meet Quality of Service (QoS) demands. To address these challenges, this study proposes MMATD3-SPS, an enhanced resource allocation algorithm that integrates a Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MMATD3) framework into the conventional SPS scheme. By leveraging channel state information and application-layer metrics, and applying a reward decomposition strategy, the algorithm optimizes the resource selection process. Experimental results demonstrate that MMATD3-SPS improves the packet reception rate by approximately 10% in high-density traffic environments. Moreover, it ensures that 80% of data packets are updated within 100 milliseconds under aperiodic traffic conditions. These results highlight the proposed algorithm’s robustness and scalability, underscoring its potential for deployment in dynamic and complex vehicular communication scenarios."

Many algorithms, assumptions, and issues found here are unsuitable for the Cross-silo realm. The FL algorithms on tabular data blindly assume that the features are exactly the same across all silos. Although feature naming standards exist, a vast amount of data generated even before the machine learning era still play a vital role in the learning process. We propose a simple technique called Feature Mapping, where the features of the global model are manually mapped to the features of local data before the commencement of FL. This one-time process ensures data minimization and also the presence of mandatory features in participating silos. The motivation behind the work is the analysis of actual data from the Electronic Health Records of Neuroblastoma patients from many hospitals worldwide. The proposed method has been tested on similar data from the TARGET Database of the National Cancer Institute of the United States on the Intel Open FL framework."

The framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning using pre-trained models such as VGG-16 and NASNet-Mobile, and employs Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map-ping (Grad-CAM) to provide visual explanations of classification decisions. Data augmentation was applied to address dataset limitations and improve generalization.A dataset of 150 annotated ultrasound images (100 training, 50 testing) was used. Models were trained to identify key features such as color intensity, texture patterns, contours, and cystic structures. Comparative evaluation showed that NASNet-Mobile achieved the highest accuracy (93.8%), outperforming VGG-16 (92.3%) and a baseline CNN (85.4%). Grad-CAM heatmaps confirmed the models focused on clinically significant regions, reinforcing diagnostic reliability.The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning framework, enhanced with transfer learning and explainable AI, provides accurate and interpretable PCOS detection, supporting clinical decision-making and scalable integration into diagnostic workflows."

The proposed methods, sensor value imitation and feature encoding, were extensively tested under various conditions, including different lighting scenarios and indoor/outdoor settings. The results demonstrate high recognition accuracy, with the integration of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data significantly enhancing performance, especially in low-light conditions. Despite the reliance on the off-the-shelf pose estimation algorithm, which has limitations in poor lighting, the framework sets a new benchmark for gait-based identification systems and shows significant potential for applications in security and forensic analysis.

We developed a convolutional attention-based GBERT (Con-GBERT) pre-trained grapheme model, enhancing the traditional GBERT by introducing lightweight convolution modules to better model local grapheme features. Furthermore, a tone-aware weighted learning mechanism and a convolution-based attention improvement scheme were designed. Experiments on a proprietary Zhuang corpus demonstrated that the Con-GBERT-based G2P model performed exceptionally in both medium and low-resource G2P tasks. It achieved an error rate close to 1% under mediumresource conditions (8,000 training samples) and reduced the phoneme error rate (PER) and word error rate (WER) to 7.45% and $\\mathbf{1 5. 4 0 \\%}$, respectively, under low-resource conditions (1,000 training samples). These results significantly outperformed the traditional Transformer baseline model’s 16.38% PER and 32.40% WER. The findings indicate that the convolutional attention-based pre-trained grapheme model Con-GBERT offers a clear advantage in improving Zhuang G2P task accuracy and provides a new solution for speech technology research in low-resource tonal languages."

    "abstract": "User and device authentication is essential in smart environments to guarantee secure access to delicate information and systems. Traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and biometrics, often have significant vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to brute-force attacks and replication. This paper proposes an innovative authentication mechanism that leverages the strengths of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for generating unique device/user signatures and Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to accurately compare these signatures with certified ones. PUFs exploit the intrinsic manufacturing variations of hardware components to provide a unique, unclonable identifier for each user or device. In particular, optical PUFs use the inherent randomness and microscopic imperfections generated during the fabrication process in optical materials or structures. SNNs, designed to compare the similarity between two inputs by learning a shared embedding space, offer robust capabilities in identifying related entities based on limited or noisy data. Our approach enhances security by combining the unique properties of PUFs with the comparison abilities of SNNs, reducing computational overhead and storage requirements. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional authentication techniques in accuracy and resilience, offering a scalable solution for secure user and device authentication."

    "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a progressive and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood efficiently. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods such as echocardiography, although reliable, are costly, require specialized equipment, and are not always accessible in lowresource settings. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, which capture heart sounds using non-invasive and cost-effective digital stethoscopes, offer a promising alternative for automated screening. This study presents a hybrid framework combining traditional machine learning and end-to-end deep learning approaches for the detection of CHF from PCG recordings. The methodology involves comprehensive pre-processing for noise reduction, segmentation of cardiac cycles, and extraction of discriminative time-frequency features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and spectrograms. Machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, are compared with end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that learn directly from spectrogram representations. Experimental evaluation on publicly available and curated CHF-PCG datasets demonstrates that the proposed CNN-based approach achieves superior performance, with an accuracy exceeding 96%, sensitivity of 95.4 %, and specificity of 96.7 %, outperforming traditional ML models. The results highlight the potential of combining heart sound analysis with deep learning for reliable, low-cost, and accessible CHF screening in both clinical and remote healthcare settings."

We propose a “Reverse Turing Test” (RTT) framework to evaluate AI's ability to perceive human cognition and construct an adaptive teaching agent, “Xiaohang,” based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The research employs four key methods: RTT, multimodal data perception, adaptive teaching strategies, and memory-reflection mechanisms. RTT captures learners' cognitive states through interactive dialogues, multimodal perception collects multidimensional data (text, speech, images), adaptive strategies adjust teaching plans based on real-time feedback, and memory-reflection mechanisms optimize subsequent teaching outcomes. Experiments conducted in project-based learning (PBL) scenarios demonstrate that Xiaohang significantly enhances the quality of problem formulation, creativity in solution design, and task completion efficiency, validating its effectiveness in improving educational outcomes."

By using automated imaging feedback, coaches can assess players, spot key events, and rethink strategies far faster than by watching tape alone. Cricket provides a vivid case study: researchers now employ neural networks for ball tracking, pose estimation, and play identification. Yet most commercial setups cost a small fortune, because they bundle multiple synchronized cameras with specialist hardware that grassroots clubs cannot afford. To bridge that gap, the present work describes a single-camera, budget-minded system that still delivers detailed ball-tracking data. A bespoke computer-vision pipeline stitches together off-the-shelf components and open-source code. Core routines include a tuned YOLOv5 detector, a linear Kalman filter, and a custom homography stage that maps field coordinates from standard video. Rigorous backyard trials confirm the pipeline dishes out useful objective metrics, but uneven homography calibration remains the fly in the ointment as it drags accuracy down when the camera angle shifts quickly. The system proves itself as a lightweight coaching aide, not as a rival to the super-slo-mo rigs seen on television. Moving forward, we’ll need to tackle these issues like bouncing camera mounts, glare, and shifting light conditions while also expanding the analysis tools so community clubs can gain deeper insights without stretching their budgets."

The problem can be modeled as a joint scheduling and trajectory optimization problem (JSTOP). To address the challenges posed by the limitations of the traditional JSTOP algorithm, we propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm-based joint scheduling and trajectory optimization scheme (MOJSTOP), which consists of two sub-algorithms, the improved multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm (Improved MSA) and the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (Improved NSGA-II). The Improved MSA algorithm is well-suited for small-scale scenarios. In contrast, the Improved NSGA-II algorithm is designed for large-scale scenarios where the UAV has limited energy capacity. In addition, it introduces a new optimization objective that focuses on the energy utilization efficiency of the UAV. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MOJSTOP scheme exhibits superior computational efficiency, convergence, and stability in solving the JSTOP problem compared to other algorithms and is applicable to various terrains."

    "abstract": "Object detection is a core task in computer vision, yet its performance is severely degraded in low-light environments, where foreground objects blend into the background, feature contrast is reduced, and object boundaries become blurred, ultimately impairing detection accuracy. To address this problem, we propose FFE-DETR, an end-to-end detection framework specifically designed for low-light scenes. The model incorporates a Frequency-Aware Feature Enhancer that applies Laplacian pyramid decomposition to separate low-frequency and high-frequency components. The low-frequency features are globally modeled to enhance foreground saliency and emphasize object boundaries, and the enhanced representation subsequently guides high-frequency detail restoration and noise suppression, yielding clearer and more discriminative features. In addition, a Multi-Scale Adaptive Feature Fusion module is introduced to efficiently integrate shallow texture information with deep semantic cues, enhancing the feature representation capability across different scales. Experimental results on widely used low-light benchmarks demonstrate that FFE-DETR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves significantly superior detection accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness."

The global problem is reduced to a system involving interface and corner degrees of freedom, together with independent subdomain problems, thereby significantly lowering computational complexity. A nodal integration scheme constructs system matrices directly using Vandermonde and differentiation matrices, supporting non-uniform high-order interpolation without Gaussian quadrature. Physics-dependent subdomain partitioning enables tailored discretization for each physical field, enhancing modeling flexibility and algorithmic generality. The method maintains high accuracy in large-scale simulations, supports automatic corner-node selection, and is inherently parallelizable. Several benchmarks validate its accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in simulating challenging transient electro-thermo-mechanical problems."

    "abstract": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer a question based on the content of a given video. Recent methods adapt image-text pre-trained models to the VideoQA task by designing learnable temporal modules within the image encoder. However, these methods struggle to fully comprehend the questions and effectively extract temporal information due to 1) over-reliance on candidate answers and 2) lack of explicit temporal modeling. Specifically, since the question is fixed in different question-answer pairs, existing models tend to focus on the varying candidate answers. Moreover, existing methods merely utilize the classification loss to constrain the confidence of candidate answers, failing to differentiate the effectiveness of temporal information and to explicitly guide temporal modeling. In this paper, we introduce the Question Understanding and Temporality Guiding (QU-TG) method to address the aforementioned limitations. To reduce over-reliance on candidate answers, we propose providing diverse questions through question selection and enhancing the model's comprehensive understanding of questions through question-video matching. To conduct explicit temporal modeling guiding, we propose negative video prevention and positive video guidance to conduct explicit temporal modeling guiding. Negative video prevention incorporates a prevention loss to discourage the model from making predictions based on erroneous temporal cues, whereas positive video guidance utilizes classification loss to encourage the model to derive correct answers from positive videos. Extensive experiments on the NExT-QA, IntentQA, STAR-QA, and Causal-VidQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method."

However, reliable fault detection remains challenging due to the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of vibration signals. This study proposes a hybrid fault diagnosis method that integrates Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with the Teager Energy Operator (TEO) to enhance the fault-related features in vibration signals. The extracted features are classified using machine learning algorithms, with a primary focus on Random Forest (RF). The performance of the proposed VMD-TEO-RF approach is benchmarked against other classifiers including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The VMD-TEO-RF model achieved a classification accuracy of 99.9%, outperforming KNN (85%), and SVM (90%). Additionally, a comparative analysis with the conventional Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method highlights the superior sensitivity and accuracy of the proposed technique. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting incipient faults in rolling bearings, offering a reliable and scalable solution for predictive maintenance in industrial applications."

By transforming a traditionally vertically integrated architecture into an open, data-driven one, O-RAN promises to enhance operational flexibility and drive innovation. In this paper, we harness O-RAN’s openness to address one critical threat to 5G availability: signaling storms caused by abuse of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol. Such attacks occur when a flood of RRC messages from one or multiple User Equipments (UEs) deplete resources at a 5 G base station (gNB), leading to service degradation. We provide a reference implementation of an RRC signaling storm attack, using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform to evaluate its impact on a gNB. We supplement the experimental results with a theoretical model to extend the findings for different load conditions. To mitigate RRC signaling storms, we develop a threshold-based detection technique that relies on RRC layer features to distinguish between malicious activity and legitimate high network load conditions. Leveraging O-RAN capabilities, our detection method is deployed as an external Application (xApp). Performance evaluation shows attacks can be detected within 90 ms, providing a mitigation window of 60 ms before gNB unavailability, with an overhead of $1.2 \\%$ and $0 \\%$ CPU and memory consumption, respectively."

Despite the theoretical distinction between social and academic sense of belonging in higher education, prior literature in engineering and computing education has predominantly emphasized the social dimension of sense of belonging. To address this gap, this multi-methods research explores the multidimensional nature of sense of belonging - academic and social sense of belonging - in the context of globalized engineering graduate education, while navigating students' perceptions of uniquely globalized educational setting. The quantitative survey study aims to investigate how academic and social sense of belonging within different two types of engineering graduate student communities - a research lab and an academic unit - interact in influencing students' satisfaction and intention to stay. The study considers the potential interplay of students' citizenship status (e.g., domestic vs. international) in shaping their academic and social sense of belonging. The qualitative open-ended survey study aims to explore how students perceive the advantages of and challenges in the globalized educational environment, understanding how the context-specific characteristics interact with students' sense of belonging and broader educational experiences. The findings suggest that academic and social sense of belonging play distinct roles in shaping different types for engineering graduate students, while also highlighting the significance of academic sense of belonging - an often-overlooked aspect of sense of belonging in literature - in influencing students' intention to stay. This research contributes to advancing the sense of belonging literature by expanding the conceptual understanding of sense of belonging."

WOA performs weaker and is more sensitive to parameter tuning.

This research presents the development of an IoT-based system designed to optimize energy consumption of AC usage through automated recommendations based on real-time data collection. The system integrates environmental and occupancy sensors with an artificial neural network-based nonlinear regression model that is trained to predict AC power consumption based on features such as room humidity, climate conditions, and room occupancy levels. The optimal AC temperature setting is determined through an optimization algorithm to achieve the minimal power consumption target. A responsive web dashboard is developed as a user interface that provides real-time monitoring of data related to AC energy usage, environmental conditions, room comfort level, and released carbon emission. This dashboard also displays the generated recommendations based on current condition. A test conducted in a classroom in Faculty of Engineering Universitas Indonesia resulted in an achieved energy savings and emission reduction up to 42,36% under controlled conditions. This is also while maintaining thermal comfort measured using the PMV index. The result of this study shows that a data-driven recommendation approach supported by user awareness can significantly improve the energy efficiency of AC usage."

This paper is going to present a new Meta-Cognitive Swarm Intelligencedriven Cyber Defense Architecture (MCSI-CDA) that brings well-coordinated meta-cognitive learning, swarm intelligence, and zero-trust enforcement to autonomously and proactively provide planless and continuous cyber defense. Its architecture features Meta-Cognitive Learning Engine (MCLE) which can self-regulate the detection strategies on the basis of uncertainty in the environmental situation and past performance. Considering the idea of how resilience and fault tolerance can be achieved, a Swarm Intelligence Coordination Layer (SICL) can offer decentralized anomaly consensus based on bioinspired optimization algorithms. The Zero-Trust Policy Enforcer (ZTPE) provides stringent access control and blockchain-based auditability with the Multi-Layered Threat Perception Module (MTPM) tracing contextual anomalies through graph neural networks across the physical, cyber and application layers. Moreover, a Quantum-Resilient Cryptographic Unit (QRCU), protecting communication channels against quantum-powered adversaries in the future, is also in use. Collectively these will constitute a single, selfadaptive security infrastructure with the ability to learn, grow and react in milliseconds. The suggested MCSI-CDA framework is an important advance on the way to the development of intelligent, real-time, and scalable cybersecurity solutions applied to the next generations of hyper-connected digital frameworks. The suggested MCSI-CDA approach has an overall accuracy of 97.8%."

Here, we present a single-layer AlScN-based memristor and investigate the impact of AlScN film thicknesses on storage performance. Remarkably, the storage window of the memristor increases progressively with increasing AlScN film thickness. The switching ratio reaches approximately 300 for the AlScN-based device. Moreover, the effects of high-temperature annealing on memristor performance demonstrate that the devices maintain excellent uniformity and reproducibility and preserve a well-defined memory window (~9) even after 10 min of thermal treatment at 1073 K."

First, we developed a hardware phantom that simulates multi-person NCVSM scenarios using recorded thoracic impedance signals to replicate cardiopulmonary dynamics, enabling repeatable validation under diverse conditions. Second, we designed a robust algorithm for multi-person localization leveraging sparse signal processing with physiological characteristics, alongside dictionary-based vital signs estimation that handles interfering respiration harmonics. An adaptive signal refinement procedure enhances continuous NCVSM accuracy by leveraging estimate continuity. Performance was validated through 12 phantom trials and 12 human trials in single- and multi-person scenarios, demonstrating superior performance.

However, deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained IoT devices (IoTDs) remains a significant challenge due to limited computational resources, memory, and energy availability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of model quantization techniques in reducing the computational and memory demands of DNNs, with a focus on the implementation of MAC protocols learned via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Specifically, we evaluate Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), static and dynamic, targeting inference on general-purpose CPUs embedded in Microcontroller Units (MCUs). We assess the performance of these techniques based on deployment metrics (disk usage, runtime memory, and inference time) and communication metrics (e.g., throughput). Experimental results demonstrate that quantization significantly improves deployability on constrained hardware while maintaining good levels of communication performance, enabling efficient integration of AI-based MAC protocols in HoT networks."

Levying low-cost wearable sensors (Muse EEG and MPU-6050), the system has real-time signal acquisition, sophisticated preprocessing, spectral and statistical feature extraction, as well as multimodal fusion features. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection techniques, including Principal Component Analysis and XGBoost gain metrics, enhance learning optimally. Multiple machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM and XGBoost are trained to identify engagement states with high accuracy, warranted by extensive testing through cross-validation, ROC AUC, and F1-scores. The pipeline is incorporated into an adaptive feedback system that can regulate chatbot tone, learning material, or interactive graphics based on detected user states. Statistical validation with linear mixed models confirms the robustness of EEG-derived measurements in engagement prediction. The research establishes a new paradigm for emotionally intelligent AI systems and provides a technical foundation for ethical, real-time psycho-behavioural intelligence for communication networks, education systems, and cognitive health monitoring."

However, traditional IP Header Compression (IPHC) lacks selective retransmission and optimized fragmentation, reducing its effectiveness in lossy environments. This study evaluates three strategies-IPHC-only, Static Context Header Compression (SCHC)-only, and a combination IPHC + SCHC-using Contiki-NG and the Cooja simulator on a multi-hop Sky mote mesh network under varying success rates ($40 \\%-100 \\%$), focusing on energy consumption, latency, and retransmission overhead. Results show the IPHC + SCHC combination outperforms both standalone methods across all metrics. At $40 \\%$ success, it lowers energy use by $28 \\%$ over IPHC-only and $16 \\%$ over SCHC-only. Latency drops by $27 \\%$ and $13 \\%$, respectively, while retransmissions are cut by $35 \\%$ and $15 \\%$. These gains stem from combining IPHC’s lightweight compression with SCHC’s selective ACK-on-Error retransmission. This combination offers a scalable, energy-efficient solution for real-time, lowpower IoT networks in smart cities, CPS, and industry. Future work will examine secure compression using DTLS and OSCORE, real deployments, and machine learning-based context adaptation."

    "abstract": "The SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is what keeps businesses running all around the world. It assists with shipping, finance, the supply chain, and managing people in international trade. As businesses travel to foreign nations, it gets difficult to protect ERP systems because of different rules, IT platforms, and more advanced cyber threats. Some of the time, standard cybersecurity measures work, but they don't usually defend the areas of integrity, authentication, and secrecy as well as big corporations need them to. This article talks about innovative ways to make SAP ERP systems safer, like using hybrid cryptography. These measures make sure that vital firm information stays safe, is only available to people who need to see it, and is kept safe from others who shouldn't be able to read it. The system that is being presented uses both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, as well as more advanced methods like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and homomorphic encryption. Because symmetric encryption works well, it can be used to send a lot of data. On the other hand, asymmetric approaches are good for making sure that people are who they say they are and keeping keys safe. We can do secure math on encrypted data with homomorphic encryption without giving up any of the original data. They follow international rules including HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001, which makes businesses feel safe from legal and operational problems. Case-based simulations show that data privacy has improved, authentication times have gone down, and the system is more resistant to common attack types like man-in-the-middle, brute force, and insider threats. This study improves the cybersecurity of businesses by showing how well hybrid cryptography can solve the unique problems of keeping SAP ERP systems safe in worldwide settings. Adding these new ways not only makes the system stronger, but it also makes sure that business around the world works smoothly, lawfully, and with resilience. As cyber risks grow, our research shows that new ideas in cryptography are needed to maintain multinational businesses safe, dependable, and working smoothly."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has established the MQTT protocol as a de facto standard for lightweight, machine-to-machine communication. Existing intrusion-detection solutions often incur prohibitive latency for edge devices or fail to detect subtle, protocol-level attacks. We introduce MIPS (MQTT Intrusion Prevention System), based on a three-stage architecture that combines (ⅰ) ultrafast volume screening, (ⅱ) MQTT-semantic classification, and (ⅲ) adaptive behavioural analytics. Level 1 uses a five-feature Random Forest model to classify 72.1% of all traffic with an average latency of just 0.0156 ms per flow. Samples with low confidence are escalated to Level 2, a 30-feature Gradient Boosting classifier, while the most ambiguous 2.8% are passed to a Level 3 neural network for advanced pattern analysis. We evaluated MIPS on a proprietary corpus of 15 000 MQTT flows (3.07:1 attack-to-normal ratio). On a split of 10 000 training and 5000 test flows, MIPS achieves a final F<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>-score of 0.893 and an accuracy of 90.2%. In the comparative benchmark conducted for this study, MIPS obtained a higher F1-score than all tested single-stage baselines, including Random Forest and XGBoost. This detection performance is achieved while sustaining a throughput of 82 776 flows/s, validating the architecture’s suitability for real-time edge environments."

In contrast to traditional methods, which commonly fail to account for the dynamic stochastic character of the implementation process, the proposed model takes the complexity of project behaviors into account by decomposing it into a set of well-defined states, along with their transition probabilities. The structure provides better visibility into project outcomes so you can make proactive, data-driven decisions. A directed graph and a state transition matrix are employed to represent the process, providing six different levels at which success is evaluated. Using probabilistic evaluation, the model facilitates the early recognition of risks and increases the certainty of project planning and performance. With this method, you can monitor and adjust to the evolving real work in progress and increase the likelihood of success for complex development efforts. The model offers a rational and quantitative approach for enhancing management efficiency and the resilience and sustainability of overall project outcomes."

The proposed model jointly considers spatial base station (BS) placement, intersystem interference, received signal power, SINR, and individual user data rates. A genetic algorithm with adaptive selection, crossover, and mutation operators, enhanced with a local search mechanism, is applied to determine the optimal number and locations of BSs. The fitness function aims to maximize the average data rate while introducing penalties for overloaded BSs, excessive deployment density, and violations of Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The results demonstrate that the average user data rate improves with increased BS density only up to a critical point, beyond which interference begins to dominate, leading to performance degradation. These findings highlight the importance of intelligent optimization methods in 5G network planning and suggest directions for future research involving parameter tuning and adaptive radio resource management."

Despite extensive research linking innovation and financial performance, empirical evidence in the renewable energy sector remains fragmented, especially in the manner in which innovation and financial structure to determine the profitability in firms. The non-linear nature of these relationships can be difficult to explain using the traditional econometric models. This study aims to examine the impact of innovation and key financial determinants such as innovation, sales, total debt to equity, total debt to capital invested, total assets, total intangible assets, and current ratio on return on assets (ROA) among the top 50 renewable energy firms worldwide from 2020 to 2024. Using a machine learning framework, seven algorithms were employed: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), J48 Decision Tree, Random Tree, and Random Forest. Model performance was evaluated. The results reveal that tree-based models, particularly Random Tree and Random Forest, being more effective than linear and probabilistic models in predicting the profitability of a firm. Random Tree was the most accurate, whereas Rand Forest was more generalized, which proves its efficiency in real-world prediction. These results indicate that the relationships between innovation and profitability in renewable energy companies are non-linear and multi-dimensional, which are conditioned by the interaction of the intensity of innovation, leverage, and asset efficiency. The novelty of this research is that it combines financial and innovation data in the context of a machine learning algorithm to evaluate sustainable industries financially."

Furthermore, the confusion matrix revealed only two minor misclassifications out of 512 validation samples, emphasizing the model’s robustness and reliability. These findings affirm the potential of DenseNet as an effective and accurate tool for AI-generated content detection. The study concludes that DenseNet’s architecture provides a viable framework for digital content authenticity verification and recommends extending the dataset to include generative outputs from newer AI models to enhance resilience against evolving synthesis techniques."

    "abstract": "The intensive development of supply chain activities and logistics has brought a need to have smart and responsive warehouse management systems. The work is a hybrid strategy of implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with the use of Machine Learning (ML) tools, to create a smart warehouse management system that will lead to the increased efficiency of operations, minimization of delays, and optimization of the use of resources. The suggested approach relies on the use of real-time IoT sensor data to monitor inventory and track goods and identify anomalies and uses ML models to forecast demand, optimize storage placement, and simplify order-picking operations. In contrast to how traditional warehouse systems are based on rule-based automation, autonomy of decision-making with the integration of IoT and ML through continuous learning of dynamic environments in warehouses. The framework also assists in predicting maintenance of the handling equipment and minimizes the use of energy as well as being accurate when it comes to inventory management. The proposed solution is very relevant to the contemporary and data-driven supply chain ecosystem because experimental assessment shows that the productivity, accuracy and general logistics performance have been greatly enhanced."

The system captures realtime images via camera, processes them using computer vision techniques, and extracts key body measurements including height, shoulder circumference, and waist circumference. These measurements are used to calculate Waist-to-Shoulder Ratio (WSR) and Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), which serve as the foundation for classifying users’ body types into three categories: underweight, ideal, and overweight. The system employs MediaPipe Pose to detect 33 body landmarks for accurate measurement, with calibration processes ensuring precise conversion from pixels to centimeters. The virtual try-on component uses perspective transformation to overlay clothing images onto the user’s body, dynamically adjusting to follow movements. Based on classification results, the system provides personalized outfit recommendations tailored to the user’s body type and gender, displayed as visual icons with descriptive captions. Testing with 15 subjects demonstrated measurement accuracy with Mean Absolute Error under 5% and effective clothing visualization that adapts to different body types. This integration of body classification with virtual try-on technology creates a personalized shopping experience that can potentially reduce return rates in fashion e-commerce while enhancing customer satisfaction. The system demonstrates how technological innovation can address contemporary challenges in the fashion industry through personalized digital experiences that accommodate individual body characteristics"

Usability and UX ratings, collected through short versions of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and AttrakDiff questionnaires, served as labels for training six machine learning models. Results show that spatio-temporal metrics, particularly saccade sequences and Area of Interest (AOI) transitions, are the most predictive. Models trained on fourth-order features consistently outperform those based only on aggregated third-order metrics, highlighting the importance of preserving scanpath structure and sequential gaze behavior for predictive performance in eye-tracking-based Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research."

Traditional approaches often struggle to motivate students or facilitate deep understanding, especially for complex scientific concepts. SPARC addresses these challenges by integrating interactive, narrative-driven gameplay with an artificial intelligence peer agent built on large language models. Rather than simply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry, prompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The platform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with state learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method assessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and qualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate that SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants reporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual understanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on refining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving accessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining AI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective, and engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners."

Reinforcement learning increases personalization by changing ideas based on student engagement and performance, but fairness constraints apply to all student groups. Definition tools like attribution scores, saliency maps, and Shapley value projections enhance trust and openness. These strategies assist specialists in interpreting model results. The new framework is more accurate, meaningful, easy to read, fair, and long-lasting and helps individuals remember what they've learned. Scores above 90 indicate technical skill and teaching effectiveness improvements. The recommended framework improves learning and practice by merging cultural heritage, flexible education, and dependable AI. The procedure is technologically advanced and socially acceptable.

    "abstract": "Low Earth orbit mega-constellations promise global connectivity but strain classical routing, which either relies on static \"snapshot\" topologies or greedy signal-to-noise metrics. Both approaches suffer from instability under fast geometry and frequency dynamics. We present a cross-layer routing framework under software defined networking (SDN) control that couples physical-layer direction-of-arrival (DoA) statistics with network-layer objectives. Our design models residual DoA errors as autoregressive processes, incorporates antenna pattern loss and array gain into link viability, and defines per-edge costs as a blend of expected transmission time (ETT), normalized SNR, delay, boresight error and array gain. Stability is reinforced by TTL-like survival terms, mild inter-plane penalties, and reliability floors on edge and path success. Domain assignment is solved as a capacity-constrained LEO–MEO matching with hysteresis and dwell timers, reducing controller thrash. A detailed control-plane overhead model accounts for adaptive telemetry, piggybacking, pushes and installs. Using a Walker constellation with GEO controllers and MEO forwarders, we show that the proposed approach achieves lower delay, higher delivery and longer path survival than both snapshot shortest-path (SSP) and SNR-only baselines, while keeping control airtime below capacity. Results hold across seeds, weight sweeps and ablations, demonstrating that DoA-aware, cross-layer metrics substantially improve stability and efficiency in large-scale LEO networks."

AFOP personalizes learning by adjusting project complexity based on individual progress and feedback, promoting selfpaced, outcome-focused learning. To evaluate effectiveness, we use milestone projects, exams, Q&A sessions, and student interviews. Pre- and post-semester self-assessments aligned with ABET standards guide continuous instructional improvement.

    "abstract": "Log anomaly detection plays a crucial role in the analysis of cloud log files by identifying irregular log entries that may signify system faults or security breaches. With the growing complexity of modern computing systems, traditional manual analysis methods have become increasingly impractical and time-intensive. Consequently, recent advancements have focused on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for automated log anomaly detection. Among these, transformer-based models grounded in natural language processing have demonstrated promising results. However, their effectiveness can be limited when dealing with highly unstructured log data or when anomalous events are distantly located within the logs. This limitation is primarily due to the quadratic computational complexity of standard transformers with respect to input sequence length. To overcome this challenge, sparse transformer architectures have emerged, offering sub-quadratic complexity and improved scalability. In this study, we propose a sparse transformer-based approach for analyzing cloud log data, aimed at enhancing anomaly detection and supporting evidence acquisition in cloud forensic investigations. The proposed sparse transformer-based model is evaluated using annotated benchmark datasets, with performance assessed primarily through F1-scores and the estimated probability density functions of anomaly scores. The experimental results demonstrate that the sparse transformer model consistently outperforms two other baseline models in terms of F1-score across multiple datasets, indicating that the ability to process larger input sequences contributes positively to anomaly detection performance."

We found moderate differences in the popularity of different Threads, and that popularity levels have changed over time for certain Threads (while others have been remarkably consistent). Even though students do not take Thread courses until relatively later in the curricula, students are declaring Threads in their first and second years. Although these specific concentrations are unique to the institution, this paper contributes to broader efforts in ECE and beyond to help students develop specialization within an expansive engineering discipline."

The methodology employs self-learning graph representations to optimize task prioritization and resource allocation under constraints like dynamic obstacles, communication disruptions, and shifting mission priorities. Extensive simulations across diverse scenarios, including industrial facilities, forested regions, and counter-UAV operations, demonstrate that DHA-GNN achieves a task allocation accuracy of 98.7%, outperforming traditional methods by 15% in efficiency and reducing decision latency to 0.0023 milliseconds. It excels in urban (98.2% accuracy) and rugged terrains (97.6% accuracy), ensuring robust adaptability.

    "abstract": "In the context of class-incremental learning, the primary challenge for models is to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Leveraging the strong generalization ability of frozen pre-trained models can significantly enhance model performance and alleviate catastrophic forgetting during training. To enable models to better adapt to downstream tasks, fine-tuning pre-trained models for new tasks is a common approach. However, current works struggle to balance plasticity and generalization performance after fine-tuning, as fine-tuning causes model parameters to overwrite knowledge of old tasks. This paper proposes a Dual-Branch Adaptive Balance (DBAB) framework, which consists of a plasticity branch fine-tuned from a pre-trained model and optimized for downstream tasks, and a generalization branch with frozen pre-trained parameters. The framework designs an adaptive balance mechanism for the dual branches, introduces learnable balance coefficients to dynamically fuse class prototype distances from both branches, and devises a loss function for training and regularizing the balance coefficients. This ensures a better balance between plasticity and generalization during the incremental learning process. To optimize the plasticity branch in the DBAB framework, an Adaptive Plasticity Module (APM) is proposed. Considering the heterogeneity of embedding distributions in continuous learning of downstream tasks, APM employs Mahalanobis distance for anisotropic feature alignment, uses a covariance matrix to dynamically adapt to the heterogeneous distributions of new tasks, and improves and stabilizes the Mahalanobis distance-based classification method.Experimental results show that DBAB outperforms multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR100 and CUB200, demonstrating significant performance improvements."

Pattern recognition, data mining and asset performance prediction - AI models are just a kind of machine learning or deep learning models (only using another black box instead of what already existed) that use raw data feeds in order to diagnose for instance what is actually surprising, or figure out for example what the expected performance would be if there even was one -or look for strange fight-or-flight changes to make based off some lazy portfolio management. The readings are written to a smart contract of some blockchain and invested. All the investment decisions, model updates and transaction logs related to “rights” is written on-chain so the fund is a very transparent and traceable (and of course tamper-proof) application. That is this cool piece of federated learning that is privacy preserving as well as model accountability by fairly banking its data into a private local bank (yet delivering to the global AI models).- Here smart contracts can be use, were software meets KYC like compliance or due-diligence all the while investing logic just farms across a layer automation based on several risk limit profile Assignment and/or performance triggers. It also has a live dashboard to expose the investment thesis and model history, as well as its previous on-chain activity for anyone interested. Experimental results on real-world stock market historical data show that, compared to the traditional existed investment theories, the proposed trading system has higher overall accuracy and lower decision time and transparency.

    "abstract": "Acetylcholine (ACh) detection is essential for studying the cholinergic system and diagnosing neurodegen erative disorders. Here, we present a graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensor functionalized with acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) enzyme for label-free ACh sensing. To preserve the intrinsic properties of graphene and enhance biosensor performance, we employ a Functional Layer-assisted Transfer (FLaT) strategy. This approach enables direct post-growth functionalization of graphene with a perylene bisimide (PBI) linker, preventing contamination during transfer and serving as a stable, non-covalent anchoring layer for biofunctionalization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses confirm a cleaner and more uniform surface for FLaT-treated graphene compared to non-functionalized graphene, while Raman spectroscopy verifies the high quality of the CVD-grown material. AChE enzymes are covalently attached to the PBI layer using carbodiimide cross-linker chemistry. The successful surface chemistry was confirmed by AFM and X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS). The resulting enzyme-functionalized, electrolyte-gated GFETs operate at low gate voltages (∼1V), making them well-suited for biosensing in aqueous environments. They exhibit calibrated responses to ACh concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 μM, effectively covering the physiologically relevant range found in the central nervous system. This work demonstrates the potential of the FLaT based GFET platform for sensitive, stable, and scalable neurotransmitter detection."

    "abstract": "Satellite edge cloud technology combines edge computing and satellite communications to improve data processing and reduce latency. However, traditional satellite systems have fixed hardware configurations and functions after launch, lacking the ability for dynamic adjustment. Due to the high-speed motion of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and limited communication windows, the software update processes can take tens of thousands of seconds, posing significant challenges to meeting real-time requirements. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Astraeus, an efficient containerized deployment strategy designed to tackle the difficulties of heterogeneous software deployment and high startup latency. We propose a cluster partitioning strategy tailored for large-scale satellite nodes and design a cluster collaboration mechanism based on data partitioning and bandwidth resource optimization, which enables fast distribution of large image files. Furthermore, we innovatively integrate lazy pulling technology into the satellite edge cloud. This approach significantly reduces the dependency on downloading complete images for container startup by fetching only the image index files and dynamically loading the required content during runtime. Experimental results show that our proposed approach reduces container deployment time by $99 \\%$ and accelerates file distribution speed by $98 \\%$."

    "abstract": "Lightning currents manifest as an electromagnetic pulse wave characterized by multi-frequency bands and high energy. Existing theories categorize lightning-induced faults into two types: (1) back-flashover caused by overvoltage when lightning strikes a tower, and (2) shielding-failure when lightning bypasses the overhead ground wire (OGW) and directly strikes a phase conductor. By referencing the calculation method for induced voltage (current) in parallel power-frequency lines, this study derives the mutual inductance coefficient M between the OGW and adjacent energized conductors. Subsequently, applying electromagnetic induction formulas to the lightning electromagnetic pulse frequency f and surge current IL, it is found that the induced voltage coupled to parallel phase conductors within half a span can reach 50–100 kV. Under high-frequency electric fields during thunderstorms, the capacitive impedance of moistened insulators is only 30–50 kΩ. At this induced voltage level, the high-frequency current traversing the insulator attains 1.2 A, surpassing the hazardous threshold of insulator leakage current and thus provoking flashover-induced tripping. ATP-EMTP simulations of a 220 kV transmission line confirm that lightning strikes on OGWs can generate induced voltages, leading to insulator-ground micro high-frequency currents. This process subsequently initiates power-frequency current flashover, resulting in insulation breakdown failure."

    "abstract": "Emotions are essential to human comprehension and communication. In fields including psychology, affective computing, and human-computer interaction, the ability to predict emotions from visual data, especially facial expressions has grown in popularity. Conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are good at identifying important aspects of pictures, but they frequently can’t focus on the most important areas for detecting emotions. In this study, a novel architecture is proposed that integrates a multi-head attention mechanism with CNNs to address this limitation, enabling the model to concentrate on crucial facial regions associated with emotional expressions. Our approach leverages the hierarchical feature extraction strengths of CNNs to capture detailed patterns in facial expressions. The model’s capacity to identify tiny emotional cues is improved simultaneously through the attention mechanism, which dynamically highlights the most discriminative regions. Extensive experiments on benchmark emotion recognition datasets validate our model’s superiority, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over conventional CNN-based models. These results highlight how our attention-enhanced CNN architecture can propel advancements in virtual reality, human-computer interaction, and affective computing, which analyzes and reacts to human emotions."

Literature shows that one way to bootstrap deep learning is through failure. A well-established framework for this pedagogical strategy is Productive Failure by Manu Kapur [1]. The failure approach is further supported by studies of brain activity, measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) during student problem-solving. This review focuses on establishing guidelines to operationalize the Productive Failure framework and EEG measurements for designing engineering problems. Through an exploration of prior literature regarding Productive Failure, engineering problem practices, and brain activity, the authors conducted a theory synthesis to identify these guidelines. The findings of each identified theme were clustered by similarity. Each cluster was named and considered as a guideline. The nine guidelines were organized into two main settings: individual and group, and just group. Eight guidelines were identified for individual and group settings: Challenging, Contextualized, Contrast and variety of cases, Low computation load, Scaffolding abstract items, Explain and communicate, Planned and analyzed investigations (lab), and Safe mindset (classroom environment). The only guideline for the group setting is Planned to collaborate. Future research on Meaningful Failure, a framework specifically designed to facilitate learning through failure in engineering education, will be conducted."

The proposed approach utilizes occupancy grid-based segmentation combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the visiting sequence of subregions, thereby minimizing redundant traversal. By integrating a heuristic local path planner, the method ensures complete coverage with fewer directional changes and smoother robot motion, making it adaptable to diverse spatial configurations. A rectangular decom-position-based partitioning establishes a structured foundation for segmentation, and inter-region navigation is modeled as a Traveling Salesman Path Problem (TSPP), solved using GA to handle irregular obstacle distributions. The study further incorporates subregion path information into inter-region cost evaluation, constructing a comprehensive cost model. Simulation results show that while the fixed-path priority strategy yields slightly longer paths, it significantly reduces turning frequency and overall cost, offering smoother navigation and improved maneuverability at the expense of computation time and overlap rate."

It is a major cause for mortality and morbidity across the globe, it needs early and accurate prediction and diagnosis. Present prediction systems use deep learning, ML and AI to generate models, which are used in predicting heart disease due to their interpretability and greater efficiency on datasets. This paper aims to improve heart disease prediction by considering features like gender, family history, resting heart rate, hemoglobin A1C, stress level and physical activity level in addition to present factors used in prediction, so as to know is gender playing a role in heart diseases occurrence or they are passing down genetically or does stress can effect our heart health or does hemoglobin level in blood matter in heart failure. We have used Tabular Network also known as TabNet, a deep learning approach which is used specifically in structural tabular data and selecting relevant features for prediction, to predict heart diseases Framingham heart disease dataset is used which consists of gender, family history and other features. It uses dynamic feature selection for predicting the heart diseases efficiently and achieving an accuracy of approximately 90 % while evaluating the model. Our results indicate that including the features gender and family history has produced more accurate information about the heart disease occurrence, is helpful to build models which can predict the heart disease more precisely and accurately."

In this paper, we provide an analysis of the relationship between the social and economic spheres of memecoins and how external factors influence their activity. We conducted our analyses on six case studies taken from different contexts and with unique histories, downloading data from various subreddits and blockchains.

In order to track their utilization effectively, we require effective mechanisms to identify and classify UAVs. Classical camera-based vision detection is poor in low light, fog, as well as under vision obstacles. It also subsists with vision since the UAVs emanate distinguishable sound patterns used for identification. A framework is proposed for the classification of UAVs that incorporates both vision as well as audio data. We worked on the dataset Roboflow, comprised of five classes: drone, helicopter, aircraft jet, bird, and plane. We worked on the YOLOv8 [1], ResNet18 CNN, as well as the Vision Transformer. ResNet18 CNN obtained the best visual accuracy, reaching 98.44%, followed by satisfactory results from YOLOv8 and ViT. We utilised the Drone AudioDataset for audio analysis. It comprised the CNN, the LSTM, as well as the Vision Transformer, where the ViT achieved the best precision, 95.81%. The results show that combining optical and acoustic techniques improves detection reliability, especially in challenging real-time conditions. Ongoing research will be directed towards building derivative fusion techniques to construct variable, accurate, and secure UAV surveillance platforms."

These factors degrade local features and boundary precision, hindering the performance of existing contour-based methods. To address this, we propose Ray Contour Net (RC-Net), a robust framework for boundary adaptation in noisy environments. RC-Net incorporates a Noise- Aware Attention Module to obtain noise-robust features and an Active Contour Point Initialization Module that emits contour points in a polar coordinate system anchored at local text centers. These are refined by a Deformation Module using lightweight transformers to ensure shape-aware, noise-tolerant adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a Tightness Evaluation Loss (TEL) to enforce precise boundary predictions. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets including Total-Text, CTW-1500, MSRATD500, ICDAR 2015, ICDAR2019 ArT, and ICDAR2019 MLT demonstrate consistent F-measure improvements of 2% to 3% over strong baselines, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our method."

    "abstract": "This work in progress innovative practice category paper introduces teaching using a stakeholder approach. It illustrates how this approach may be used in an electrical engineering lifelong learning course to support student learning about technology implementation involving far-reaching industry change. The stakeholder approach involves group work where students get to discuss who the important organizations, or stakeholders, are in relation to a complex electrical engineering challenge. This is a suitable approach in a lifelong learning course where students have professional experience to draw on. The uniqueness of this innovative practice is in using a stakeholder approach to teach electrical engineering in a field that is undergoing particularly rapid change involving many interconnected organizations. The paper presents the stakeholder approach, and teaching using this approach is exemplified by a lifelong learning course on the electrification of aviation. The approach is evaluated by drawing on interviews with both the teacher using this approach, and with students learning with it, in both cases for the first time. Teacher and student feedback suggests that the stakeholder approach is engaging and encourages class discussion, yet that it can also be challenging to teach with the first time around. The main take-aways from this paper are to show the usefulness of the stakeholder approach and encourage fellow teachers to give the approach a try when teaching about challenges in electrical engineering whose solutions require understanding the importance, roles, and motivations of several stakeholders."

As technical education increasingly emphasizes ethical and professional competencies alongside technical skills, the need to understand not only what students do but why they do it has grown urgent. This WIP study explores the development of attitudinal indicators as a tool to support character development in engineering and computing education. While traditional behavioral indicators focus on observable actions, attitudinal character indicators (ACI) will help surface underlying motivations, providing a richer, more nuanced understanding of professional behavior. Using a two-phase mixed-methods design, this study first employs a qualitative Delphi method to generate a consensus-based set of ACIs, followed by Q methodology to reveal shared patterns of belief and value orientations among diverse stakeholders. The findings are expected to offer actionable tools for educators aiming to cultivate well-rounded, virtuous graduates in technical fields."

    "abstract": "The main aim of traditional data preprocessing in embedded systems often prioritizes accuracy at the cost of latency and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a novel FPGA-based data preprocessing framework that unifies adaptive dimensionality reduction, sparse transformation, and hardware-aware computation within a single design. Unlike conventional PCA implementations, the proposed architecture introduces a Hybrid Sparse-Probabilistic PCA (HSP-PCA) approach that dynamically balances sparsity and probabilistic variance retention, tailored for FPGA-based computation pipelines. By optimizing covariance computation and eigen decomposition using pipelined matrix multipliers and quantized feature representations, the framework significantly reduces on-chip resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate a 43% latency reduction, 38% memory efficiency gain, and 52% higher energy efficiency compared to baseline preprocessing. The results validate that adaptive hybrid PCA integrated with reconfigurable hardware provides a scalable, low-power, and high-throughput solution for embedded intelligence."

To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture specifically designed to accommodate the unique demands of small objects, termed AMFC-DEIM. This framework introduces three key innovations: (1) the Adaptive One-to-One (O2O) matching mechanism, which enhances Dense O2O matching by adaptively adjusting the matching grid configuration to the object distribution, thereby preserving the resolution of small objects throughout training; (2) the Focal Convolution Module, engineered to explicitly align with the spatial characteristics of small objects for extracting fine-grained features; and (3) the Enhanced Normalized Wasserstein Distance, which stabilizes the training process and bolsters performance on small targets. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmark remote sensing small object detection datasets: RSOD, LEVIR-SHIP and NWPU VHR-10, demonstrate that AMFC-DEIM achieves remarkable performance, attaining AP<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{50}$</tex-math></inline-formula> scores of 96.2%, 86.2%, and 95.1%, respectively, while maintaining only 5.27M parameters.

    "abstract": "This Work-in-Progress (WIP) study explores the impact of sensory-adapted examination environments on neurodivergent students in a postgraduate computing module within an MSc Software Development program. As concerns about generative AI increase pressure to reintroduce invigilated exams in higher education, there is a renewed urgency to ensure such environments are accessible for all learners. Neurodivergent students—including those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia—often face unique sensory and cognitive challenges that are not fully addressed by standard accommodations such as extra time or separate rooms. The module included three examinations throughout the course. While the first two were completed under typical conditions for students in the specialised quiet room, the final exam—weighted at 50%—introduced a set of tailored, sensory-friendly adjustments. These included: (1) noise-cancelling headphones with the option of white noise, music, or silence; (2) a fixed overall exam duration, incorporating extra time and rest breaks to reduce time-related anxiety; and (3) an editable digital exam format to support accessibility and executive functioning. Eleven neurodivergent students opted into the specialised quiet room setting. Post-exam surveys and interviews revealed that all students rated their experience of the adjustments at the highest level (5/5), reporting improvements in focus, reduced anxiety, and greater comfort during the exam. Performance data indicated a 2.0% increase in average scores following the adjustments, compared to a 0.9% increase across the overall cohort. While the small sample size limits statistical generalisation, these results suggest that sensory-adapted environments may offer meaningful benefits for neurodivergent learners. This study underscores the value of moving beyond conventional accommodations toward more holistic and personalised approaches to exam accessibility. Further research is needed to assess the scalability of such interventions across larger and more diverse student populations."

Classroom videos were analyzed using three prompt variations, with and without YOLO assisted tracking, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were evaluated. The ground truth was established through manual evaluation by three expert instructor volunteers using standardized rubrics, resulting in strong inter-annotator agreement as measured by Fleiss's Kappa. Results indicate that integrating YOLO object detection models with LLMs significantly improves classification accuracy by reducing false positives and enhancing student tracking, while prompt specificity influences attention state recognition.

    "abstract": "Plasma-activated aerosols produced via surface acoustic wave (SAW) nebulization has the potential for improving surface disinfection processes by providing wider distribution coverage due to the dispersibility of the aerosols. Motivated by previous studies showing that increasing the electrical conductivity of air plasma-activated water led to a significant reduction in the SAW nebulization rate, which poses a severe limitation to the efficiency of the technology, we evaluate here the use of argon plasma-jet-activated water as an alternative to air plasma-jets. Compared to the higher electrical conductivity of air plasma-jet-activated water (0.3 mS/cm ≤ σ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub> ≤ 4 mS/cm), argon plasma-jet-activated water has substantially lower conductivity (4 μS/cm ≤ σ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</sub> ≤ 40 μS/cm) and hence more efficient nebulization (103% higher nebulization rate compared to that for deionized water, in contrast to 65% lower nebulization rate with air plasma-jets). Nevertheless, despite its lower electrical conductivity, the argon plasma-jet-activated water was observed to maintain <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Escherichia coli</i> (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E. coli</i>) inactivation efficacy even after 4 days of storage due to the high hydrogen peroxide concentrations that were produced. This is in sharp contrast to air plasma-jet-activated water, which yielded only limited bacterial inactivation efficiency (approximately 10.5% reduction) even when fresh and surprisingly promoted <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E. coli</i> growth after one day of storage. In particular, we found that 2.4 g of the argon plasma-jet aerosols, equivalent to just 10 mins of nebulization, was capable of achieving 100% bacterial inactivation, thus alluding to the platform’s potential for efficient and effective spray-based surface disinfection."

    "abstract": "This innovative practice WIP paper describes a relatively new course that was created at The Ohio State University and first offered in 2019, centered on international community-based service learning in the South American nation of Guyana. The course was created based on the principles of IDEO's human centered design which focuses on three different phases of the design process, namely, Inspiration, Ideation and Implementation. These three phases were applied in a three-year cycle, where each year focused on one design phase. The first full cycle was successfully completed in December 2023 with the installation of solar powered generator systems in two communities in Guyana. A unique feature of this collaboration was the direct interaction between university faculty and communities without the presence of third-party facilitators. This approach was successful because strategies employed included faculty working with local government in Guyana, understanding the local culture, consistent and effective communication and prioritization of reciprocity. The first cycle essentially took five (5) years to complete due to disruptions that were a direct result of the COVID-19 global pandemic in 2020. The intentional design was chronicled carefully in every completed year of the cycle to ensure that each subsequent batch of students could build on the work of the previous groups. The potential significance of this contribution is that it can offer valuable insights for universities wishing to facilitate these faculty-led international partnerships. Future research will include conducting a narrative study to better understand the perspectives of faculty, students and community partners."

Federated learning has revolutionized medical machine learning while respecting privacy. The proposed method lets several medical facilities train deep learning models simultaneously while ensuring data privacy and fulfilling all standards. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and differential privacy protect data, reduce leaks, and accelerate model convergence. A privacy budget tracker monitors privacy loss and ensures long-term privacy protection. The suggested method outperforms FL techniques in accuracy, communication overhead, computing efficiency, privacy, security, scalability, and energy efficiency. The technology increases accuracy to 94.8%, reduces transmission costs to 150 MB, and increases computing performance to 1.8 million FLOPs per second. The privacy score is 9.5/10, and the security score is 9.0/10, protecting you from dangers. It can scale to 500 clients, making it more scalable than other methods. Health care compliance has increased to 9.8/10, with more people following HIPAA and GDPR. With these advancements, the FL framework is one of the best methods for analyzing brain images with privacy protection. It allows safe, effective, and scalable medical AI app use."

    "abstract": "The believable simulation of multi-user behavior is crucial for understanding complex social systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents have made signifi cant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like intelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often dynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal interactions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we present LMAgent, a very large scale and multimodal agents society based on multimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents can autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live streaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a self-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal capabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance over the existing multi agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory mechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system ef f iciency, which supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on agents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to humans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing LLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are exhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent in credible large-scale social behavior simulations."

    "abstract": "In affective computing, healthcare, and human-computer interaction, the use of EEG signals for emotion detection is becoming more and more significant. In order to objectively categorize emotional states, these systems examine brainwave activity. Nevertheless, the majority of current models depend on high-density electrode arrays, like those with 14 or 32 channels, which guarantee high accuracy but have drawbacks in terms of affordability, portability, and computational effectiveness. It is essential for real-world applications to reduce the number of channels without appreciably compromising accuracy. In order to reduce hardware complexity and maintain accuracy that is comparable to traditional 14- channel models, we propose a novel optimized 4-channel EEG-based emotion detection system. Using the four- quadrant emotion model (valence vs. arousal), it carefully chooses electrode locations that are best suited for emotion classification. A Random Forest Regression model is trained using the DEAP dataset, which is a popular emotion recognition benchmark. By fine-tuning the model, it becomes more effective at mapping EEG features to emotional states, and our system achieves an accuracy of 83.3%, proving its viability for low-cost, portable emotion detection. Our system improves EEG-based emotion recognition by addressing issues of cost and portability, improving accessibility, and detecting stress, anxiety, and depression in mental health monitoring, as well as adaptive human-computer interfaces that react dynamically to user emotions."

This paper presents a systematic evaluation of the navigation accuracy of GNSS and INS integration using both loose and tight coupling strategies under such conditions. First, mathematical models for both integration approaches are derived. Then, field experiments are conducted using real-world data collected in both coupling modes. Experimental results show that under normal GNSS signal conditions, the tightly coupled method improves positioning accuracy by 9.09% in the North direction and 18.18% in the Up direction compared to the loosely coupled method, while the positioning error in the East direction remains essentially the same for both. In terms of velocity accuracy, the tightly coupled system demonstrates improvements of 9.09%, 20.00%, and 20.00% in the North, East, and Up directions, respectively, with particularly notable enhancements in the East and Up components. For attitude estimation, the tightly coupled system improves heading, roll, and pitch accuracy by 0.60%, 2.61%, and 22.39%, respectively. When GNSS signal outage occurs, the loosely coupled system is unable to provide navigation or positioning outputs, whereas the tightly coupled system can still output navigation data, albeit with reduced accuracy. Therefore, in complex urban environments, tight GNSS and INS integration is recommended as the preferred strategy to ensure better accuracy and availability in integrated navigation."

This dataset labeled with both single and multiple emojis, covering 2,114 unique emojis. Sequential models like LSTM showed limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformer-based models, particularly fine-tuned RoBERTa, offered better contextual understanding. We further introduce a novel Semantic Similarity-Based Emoji Prediction (SSEP) approach, combining word and emoji embeddings with Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) to enhance semantic matching and retrieval. Comparative evaluation with English, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic methods highlights the unique low-resource constraints of Urdu.

    "abstract": "Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing is a multidimensional challenge that threatens the sustainability of global marine resources, particularly for Indonesia as the world’s largest archipelagic state. One of the most destructive forms of IUU fishing is the use of bottom trawl nets, which can severely damage seabed ecosystems and endanger both fish populations and the livelihoods of small-scale fishers. Although regulations such as Ministerial Regulation No.2/2015 of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries explicitly ban the use of trawls, violations remain prevalent, especially in remote coastal areas due to limited monitoring and surveillance technologies. This study proposes the development of an underwater monitoring system based on autonomous technology and artificial intelligence by integrating a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and an Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV). The ROV is equipped with a Raspberry Pi controller and an underwater camera for capturing live video footage, which is transmitted to the ASV via User Datagram Protocol (UDP) communication over Cat5 LAN cable. The ASV, powered by Jetson Orin Nano, serves as the data processing and communication hub, enabling real-time object detection using the You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) algorithm—a deep learning method renowned for its speed and accuracy in object classification. The models were trained using Roboflow and showed excellent performance, with an accuracy rate of 95%. On testing, the system successfully detected 241 non-trawl objects and 115 trawl objects, which shows the effectiveness of the model in classifying fishing gear in real-time."

    "abstract": "This innovative practice full research paper explores the role of the instructional team in supporting teamwork within a large, project-based course for first-year cybersecurity students. The study investigates how instructional teams can enhance collaboration and problem-solving skills critical for student success. Guided by two research questions, the study examines: (1) How do students perceive the effectiveness of instructional team support in facilitating teamwork? and (2) What aspects of instructional support shape students' collaboration experiences? At semester's end, 141 students completed a survey reflecting on their teamwork experiences and the instructional team's role. Thematic analysis of the qualitative responses revealed that students highly valued clear guidelines and expectations provided by the instructional team, which improved assignment understanding and coordination. Constructive feedback helped students refine their work, particularly on team milestones. Responsiveness and timely communication were frequently praised, with students noting the importance of quick, helpful replies. The instructional team also assisted with conflict resolution and interpersonal challenges, ensuring a productive team environment. Office hours were especially important for interpreting feedback and improving outcomes. Additional support included teaching teamwork strategies and offering emotional encouragement, which students found motivating. However, students suggested improvements such as clearer, more actionable feedback, refined rubrics, additional templates or examples, and more proactive outreach. These findings underscore the critical influence of a responsive instructional team in fostering collaboration in projectbased learning. By addressing students' feedback, instructional teams can more effectively support the development of essential teamwork and professional skills in STEM education."

    "abstract": "The cloud–fog automation (CFA) paradigm accelerates Industry 4.0 by enabling fully automated industrial systems through interconnected wired and wireless devices. However, dynamic uncertainties such as environment-induced network delays and disturbances challenge the stability and efficiency of these systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes a control–communication co-design framework named C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>L (Control– Communication Coupling Loop), which integrates 5G and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) to coordinate transmission and control across cloud and fog layers. A hierarchical control strategy is introduced based on a delay threshold derived from Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) analysis, enabling dynamic selection between cloud and fog control units for both stability and responsiveness. To ensure timely and reliable control input delivery under uncertain networks, we develop a deterministic transmission mechanism centered on a novel metric, Packet Loss Tolerance (PLT), which quantifies how many consecutive losses the system can endure while maintaining stability. Additionally, a new optimization criterion, Pareto Deviation Value (PDV), is proposed to avoid combining control and communication costs with incompatible physical units. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances control robustness and communication efficiency in complex industrial networks."

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) combine flexibility with high performance, making them a promising solution for data-intensive computing. CGRA compilers are essential for determining how data flow graphs (DFGs) are executed on hardware. Recently, machine learning-based compilers have garnered significant attention for CGRA compilation. However, few deep learning compilers leverage the rich attentional information between DFGs and the CGRA abstractions effectively. Meanwhile, traditional compilers continue to struggle with inadequate compilation quality and long compilation time. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based compiler that integrates transformer encoders with reinforcement learning (RL) to address these issues. The transformer encoder captures task dependencies by embedding feature maps from both the DFG and CGRA abstraction. Additionally, we design a tree-structured RL agent that employs spectral clustering to explore the extensive mapping solution space, optimizing task-to-resource allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) compilers, achieving an average 1.22× improvement in compilation quality, a 33.39% increase in throughput, and a 12.83× speedup in compilation time, underscoring its potential to enhance CGRA performance."

    "abstract": "Mobile services such as Augmented Reality (AR) and online gaming require high computing and storage resources with real-time data exchange with servers. However, mobile devices are resource-constrained and cloud computing incurs additional network latency which makes them dissatisfactory to use such mobile services. To tackle this challenge, service caching has been emerging as a critical technology that provides services by leasing resources from mobile edge computing (MEC) servers located close to the users. Unlike content caching, which stores data only for delivery, service caching utilizes both computing and storage resources, and thereby should be jointly considered with code offloading which offloads the processing workloads of mobile devices to servers. Therefore, the conventional caching strategy that caches the most popular services may not be the best choice, and the intertwined nature of service caching and code offloading policies makes the system operation complex. In this paper, we formulate an average cost (energy consumption, offloading payment) minimization problem of mobile devices constrained by service queue stability in a three-layer (mobile/MEC/cloud) network architecture. We apply a statistic-based dynamic optimization framework to derive an online-fashioned interTWined Interplay between Storage and Transmission, namely TWIST algorithm that jointly makes decisions of service caching, CPU clock frequency of mobile devices, and code offloading. Next, via theoretical analysis, we show the trade-off relationships between the average cost of mobile devices and service delay. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that TWIST can save up to 51% of cost for the same delay of 2.41sec. compared to the existing algorithms."

    "abstract": "This Work-in-Progress paper introduces an experiential, game-based intervention for teaching engineering ethics to upper-level undergraduates in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE). Traditional ethics instruction often emphasizes compliance and regulatory frameworks, which may inadequately prepare students for real-world dilemmas characterized by incomplete information, ambiguous trade-offs, and the need for trust among interdisciplinary teams. To address this gap, we developed a role-playing card game grounded in experiential learning theory, socio-technical systems thinking, and moral development frameworks. Students assume roles as Managers or Engineers within fictional companies competing for a client's sponsorship. Managers are briefed on project priorities (e.g., cost, sustainability), while Engineers possess information about available resources. This asymmetrical distribution of knowledge simulates real-world engineering environments and requires students to iteratively negotiate and revise design proposals under ethical and practical constraints. An “Ethics Points” system incentivizes decisions that prioritize stakeholder accountability, and final scoring rewards trustworthiness over profitmaximization. The educational setting includes mixed-methods assessment: post-game surveys to evaluate changes in ethical sensitivity and moral reasoning; qualitative reflection essays; and observational analysis of team dynamics during gameplay. Preliminary results indicate heightened engagement, improved ethical awareness, and stronger collaboration-findings that align with existing literature on the benefits of simulation- and game-based learning in engineering ethics. This intervention aims to humanize STEM instruction by embedding ethical reasoning into collaborative, interactive activities. The findings offer implications for broader integration of trust-centered pedagogies in interdisciplinary engineering courses and professional training contexts."

    "abstract": "This Research-to-Practice full paper evaluates the impact of a leadership development framework within a Mobile Application Development (MAD) course, focusing on the integration of Scrum, Challenge-Based Learning (CBL), and shared leadership. The study addresses the growing importance of soft skills in software engineering education and aims to provide insights into the influence of this framework on the leadership skills of software engineering students. The framework combined agile practices, specifically Scrum, with CBL and shared leadership, incorporating “role rotation” in which student teams rotated Scrum roles (Scrum Master and Product Owner) at the end of each sprint. An 8-week case study was conducted with nine teams, four of which applied the framework. After each sprint, all team members completed a questionnaire to assess their teamwork, with a final Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire administered at the end of the development cycle. The results showed that the framework was easy to adopt, improved team collaboration, and empowered students to take proactive leadership roles. Although the generation of CBL guiding questions had less impact than anticipated, the overall structure supported collaborative learning. Some students suggested that the role rotation ceremony could be shortened to better align with Scrum Sprint Retrospective outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights for academia and industry. In academia, the framework offers a way to enhance software engineering education by integrating leadership skills development into Scrum-based group projects. For industry, the framework can foster improved team cohesion by reframing leadership as a collaborative process."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the research interest in bidirectional charging of electric vehicles has increased significantly, driven by improved accessibility to charging and payment information as well as the increasing emphasis on integrating variable renewable energy sources more effectively into the grid. Integrating bidirectional charging with the grid/building/home can also reduce grid congestion. Despite this, broader implementation of this technology has not yet been achieved. In this context, this paper comprehensively surveys direct current (DC) off-board vehicle to grid/building/home chargers and analyses the gaps which prevent the technologies' wide implementation. These gaps are analysed by considering areas such as the development direction of bidirectional charging technology, battery cost and its degradation, V2G applicable standards, grid codes and charging protocols, deployment of V2G chargers (off-board versus on-board/wireless), market feasibility of V2G services, and the cost of bidirectional off-board chargers. The first survey of twenty-five commercial bidirectional chargers is presented and investigated in relation to the above-mentioned areas. Four key (technical, regulatory, financial, and behavioural) barriers are identified and discussed for the wide implementation of vehicle to grid/building/home charging."

During normal operation, with consideration of the varying PV output power, the converter achieves regulation under different input powers with inner bridge phase-shift modulation. The power transfer capacity and soft-switching operation region under the normal operation mode are analyzed. When a short-circuit fault occurs at certain DC PV port, the fault port isolation and non-fault port reconfiguration are realized through the modulation strategy. The proposed topology is compared with the traditional parallel and series topology in terms of cost, volume, and power loss. Both normal operation and fault reconfiguration are tested through simulation and experimental results, in verification of the proposed topology and modulation methods."

    "abstract": "In the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), certificateless-based authentication has emerged as a promising approach to secure federated learning (FL) participation. However, existing certificateless-based authentication schemes still exhibit three notable limitations: (i) some schemes cannot provide security against public-key replacement (PKR) attacks and key-leakage threats; (ii) most existing schemes do not take realistic coalition attacks into account; (iii) while some schemes applicable to FL settings can offer relatively comprehensive security guarantees, they often rely on costly cryptographic operations. These limitations make it challenging for certificateless authentication frameworks to simultaneously ensure high security and low latency, particularly in resource-constrained FL deployments within IoV environments. To address these challenges, we propose FedAuth, a certificateless, lightweight, and privacy-enhanced authentication scheme tailored for FL in IoVs. First, FedAuth establishes a structured pseudonymization mechanism that enables vehicles to anonymously participate in the FL process while maintaining accountability. Afterwards, FedAuth ensures robust authentication security by cryptographically anchoring key generation to each vehicle’s pseudonym, enforcing strict key validation, and introducing hash-bound multi-layered signature verification that prevents signature recombination, thereby resisting PKR attacks, coalition attacks, and key-leakage threats. Second, FedAuth guarantees the authenticity and integrity of gradients through lightweight signature construction, which supports batch authentication while avoiding expensive operations such as bilinear pairings, thereby reducing latency. Security analysis shows that FedAuth preserves identity privacy and ensures model integrity in the face of adversarial conditions. Experimental results confirm that FedAuth significantly reduces computational overhead by at least 43.42% and saves not less than 19.8 KB of communication cost per 100 vehicles, outperforming state-of-the-art schemes in both efficiency and robustness."

    "abstract": "This work aims to explore the application of big data in evaluating and quantifying the performance of green bonds through Big Data Analytics (BDA) with a particular focus on predictive analytics and sentiment analysis. Financial instruments for sustainable development, like green bonds, remain complicated in addressing the measurement difficulties economically and ecologically, primarily because of market uncertainty and the dynamic environment. Forecasting is used to determine financial profitability and measures of economic sustainability. In contrast, sentiment analysis is applied to evaluate the opinion of the public and other stakeholders about environmental activities. Notably, in the context of the current research, the quantitative research paradigm was chosen for this position, and it was applied when distributing a questionnaire to 250 working professionals within the fields of green finance and environmental impact assessment. Lastly, the paper demonstrates that the developed predictive model explains 72.9% of the Green Bond's performance, and the sentiment model explains 69.4 % of the environmental effect. Thus, these studies support the notion that adopting big data and analytics in conjunction with green finance and increasing transparency and corporate responsibility can tackle some of these problems and align with sustainable goals."

Undergraduate research experiences can increase student retention rates in STEM pathways, with a notable impact on students from historically underrepresented groups (HUGs). However, these research experiences are often inaccessible to students, particularly in high-demand research areas and at large institutions. Inspired by Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs), we develop a scalable approach where research mini-projects are introduced into a standard, upper-division optimization for machine learning (ML) course. Through careful structuring of the project we are able to offer this to classes of hundreds of students, with limited teaching assistant support and relatively low instructor burden relative to traditional CUREs. In the post-project survey, most participants, including students from HUGs or with no prior research experience, reported moderate to large gains in readiness for further research, understanding of the engineering-mathematics research process, the ability to read and comprehend scientific literature, and self-confidence. Our specific offerings have been released publicly for easy replication."

    "abstract": "Mental health disorders affect over 970 million people worldwide, approximately one in eight, with prevalence increasing since 1990. This study applied Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithms to identify key psychological, biological, lifestyle, and social risk factors in a cohort of 1,000 individuals, with a nearly balanced target variable of 51.5% with and 48.5% without mental health diagnoses. The performance of the GB model exceeded RF in accuracy and sensitivity, though both models exhibited low specificity (<80%), indicating caution for clinical use. Feature importance metrics, including Gini impurity for RF and Gain, Cover, and Frequency for GB, assessed each factor’s contribution and consistency across multiple data splits of 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. Stress level consistently emerged as the strongest key risk factor, with consultation history and severity of mental illness showing moderate influence; stress is modifiable through interventions such as stress-reduction programs, mindfulness training, and cognitive-behavioural therapy. Biological factors (age, gender) had minimal influence and are non-modifiable, though awareness can support personalised strategies. Social factors (work hours, occupation) and lifestyle factors (sleep, physical activity) were moderate-to-weak but modifiable. The country as a social factor influenced model training but had limited impact on predictions for new data related to mental health. Overall, the findings offer practical guidance for interventions targeting modifiable factors, while non-modifiable factors inform personalised approaches."

Its popularity is growing, but as more users join, the system can become complex. Although various traditional solutions tackle this problem in CC, thanks to developments and innovations in machine learning (ML), more effective and diverse ways are being developed. These developments enable users to access CC systems at a lower cost. Moreover, they help cloud providers deliver their services to customers more efficiently, with lower costs and reduced energy consumption, contributing to the creation of a more sustainable CC environment. Therefore, this study focuses on the Q-learning algorithm, a type of ML that can be helpful in scheduling tasks in CC, and presents a detailed analysis with a comparative performance evaluation against traditional methods like Round Robin (RR).

Microphone array (MA) is an efficient technique for extracting the original clean speech data while eliminating the surrounding noise, interference or other noise from different directions. Superdirective beamformer (SDB) is widely installed in numerous speech applications due to its high directivity factor towards the sound source, and the ability of concerning the steered beampattern at certain direction. However, in an annoying recording scenario, the imprecise configuration of MA geometry, the inaccurate estimation of preferred steering vector, the different microphone sensitivities, the moving head of speaker, the error of defined sampling frequency, the imprecise representation of recording situation, the SDB beamformer’s performance often degraded. Therefore, speech distortion and the existence of remaining noise at SDB beamformer’s output signal still a challenge task. In this contribution, the author proposed a modified SDB beamformer to enhance the evaluation in reducing the speech distortion, musical noise and increasing the speech quality in realistic real-life recording environment. The promising results has confirmed the capability of the author’s suggested technique in decreasing the speech distortion to $13.3 \\mathbf{d B}$, suppressing the noise level to 9.1 dB and improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to 9.8 dB. The obtained promising result shown that the proposed method can be integrated into multiple microphones system to resolve complicated problem, such as automatic speech recognition, reverberation."

This paper proposes a novel Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (CSA)optimized deep learning framework for robust Android malware detection in e-governance environments. Inspired by the adaptive hunting strategies of chameleons, CSA balances exploration and exploitation to optimize feature subset selection, hyperparameter tuning, and class-weight calibration in deep neural architectures. The framework integrates static (permissions, API calls, opcodes) and dynamic (network traffic, system calls) features into a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model, with CSA performing meta-heuristic optimization. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets (Drebin, CICMalDroid 2020, AndroZoo) demonstrate that the CSA-optimized model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches-including PSO, GA, Grey Wolf Optimizer, and Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm-across metrics such as F1-score, AUC, and MCC. The framework achieves 97.8 % accuracy with a 2.4 % reduction in false positives, highlighting its effectiveness in protecting citizen data and ensuring the trustworthiness of Android-based e-governance services. Beyond improved detection, the system offers feature interpretability, energy efficiency, and adaptability for real-world deployment, contributing toward the vision of a resilient Cyber Surakshit Bharat."

    "abstract": "Ukraine’s protected forests face growing threats from military actions, illegal logging, and economic activities, requiring continuous monitoring. Current methods are often complex and resource-intensive, limiting scalability and frequent use. This study introduces an innovative satellite-based approach for rapid forest damage detection, providing a scalable, resource-efficient solution with minimal data and computational needs. We propose an anomaly detection method using the B4 spectral band in Sentinel-2 imagery, which has been experimentally identified as the most effective for detecting forest damage in Ukraine. Our findings show that the proposed method effectively distinguishes between undamaged and damaged forest areas. We identified significant forest destruction in protected areas of eastern, northern, and southern Ukraine, particularly in regions affected by active hostilities. However, the analysis also uncovered damaged forest areas in the Carpathian region and western Ukraine, suggesting that other factors such as economic activities and illegal logging may also contribute to forest degradation. Among the most affected protected areas are Siverskyi Donets River Valley (forest damage as of 2024 - 55.59 th. ha), Chornobyl Radiation and Ecological Biosphere Reserve (13.14 th. ha), Sviati Hory National Park (13.12 th. ha), Kreminski Lisy National Park (8.62 th. ha), and Oleshky Sands National Park (8.27 th. ha). Overall, by 2024, 249.71 th. ha of forest in protected areas had been damaged, accounting for approximately 5.17% of the total protected forest area in Ukraine."

    "abstract": "Microalgae cultivation and harvesting require a real-time monitoring system to perform an optimization in the automated control. To perform a close-up monitoring, a digital monitoring system is proposed to observe the growth of microalgae with six parameters, i.e. temperature, $\\mathbf{p H}$, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, ammonia-nitrogen, and nitrate. These sensors are integrated with a programmable logic controller and Raspberry Pi for real-time data logging in a $\\mathbf{4 0 ~ L}$ cultivation tank. The installation of two RGB cameras are used to observe the green index of the microalgae. It is compared with the standard biomass measurements using optical density absorbance at 680 nm. As an observation, there is a sinusoidal cycle happening in the dissolved oxygen and $\\mathbf{p H}$ graph when microalgae carry out its photosynthesis. At the early stage of cultivation, several fluctuation occurs in the electrical conductivity and nitrate due to the microalgae activities. The change of image gradient indicates that the growth of microalgae can be linearly associated with the change of concentration. It can be an indicator for the harvesting process to be taken. The integration of color intensity with the sensory can provide a real-time monitoring for better understanding of microalgae cultivation and harvesting."

However, the evaluation of religious tourism quality based on online reviews is still rarely conducted using a structured analytical approach. Although sentiment analysis has been widely applied in various sectors, the integration of Indonesian language models with the Tourism Quality (TOURQUAL) framework remains underexplored in this context. This study proposes a hybrid analytical model integrating Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) with IndoBERT and classifying results using the six Tourism Quality (TOURQUAL) dimensions: Accessibility, Environment, Technical Quality, Human Element, Experience, and Safety. The approach is applied to online reviews of five major mosques on Java Island: Istiqlal Mosque, Al-Jabbar Mosque, At-Ta’awun Mosque, Namira Lamongan Mosque, and Surakarta Palace Grand Mosque. The findings reveal several negative evaluations that significantly influence tourist perceptions across multiple service dimensions, providing a structured basis for improving religious tourism service quality and supporting Indonesia’s efforts to achieve SDG 12."

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) first explores the design space, defined by key geometrical parameters, using finite element analysis (FEA). Although the GA effectively identifies high-performance solutions, it is inherently constrained by substantial computational demands. To address this limitation, a surrogate machine learning model called Support Vector Regression is developed and trained on finite element analysis data generated during GA evolution. The developed model predicts machine performance with exceptional accuracy (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> 0.99, Mean Absolute Error 1.18), achieving a reduction in optimization time of over 99.99% without compromising fidelity. This hybrid approach (GA + surrogate model) combines precise optimization with fast predictions for efficient machine design. The proposed hybrid framework represents the computationally efficient optimization approach for 3D machines that integrates genetic algorithms with machine learning."

This paper presents a novel system to enhance cyclist safety via a collision prevention system for a bicycle by detecting and tracking rear-approaching vehicles. The system utilizes Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to cluster LiDAR data points for identifying vehicles, achieving a mean absolute percentage error of 0.56 % and employs an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate their positions and velocities. The EKF is enhanced with a distinctive feature of adaptive parameterization with Bayesian Optimization that balances sensor trust and model fidelity, yielding a 34.38 % improvement over the standard EKF in estimation accuracy under varying cycling scenarios. Extensive simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to detect and track multiple rear vehicles at high estimation accuracies and thus, enable timely cyclist alerts. By leveraging advanced clustering and adaptive filtering techniques, the proposed estimation framework offers a robust solution in reducing bicycle-related accidents."

    "abstract": "Traditional control schemes for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems struggle to achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS), output stability, and efficiency optimization simultaneously. To address this limitation, this article proposes a discrete neighborhood search–model predictive control (DNS-MPC) strategy for multiobjective optimization in inductor-capacitor-capacitor-series (LCC-S) compensated WPT systems, addressing three critical requirements: output regulations, transmission efficiency maximization, and ZVS realization. First, a mathematical model of the WPT system is developed based on circuit analysis. The derived expressions are then used to identify the operating regions that ensure ZVS across all power switches. Second, a composite cost function is formulated to systematically coordinate voltage tracking precision and power loss minimization. Third, the DNS-MPC strategy is developed to simultaneously achieve precise output voltage regulation, high efficiency, and ZVS operation over a wide load range without auxiliary circuits. Experimental validation under multiple operating points (80/100/120 V references) demonstrates consistent performance: the maximum voltage fluctuation is limited to 0.26 V, peak efficiency reaches 93.92%, and efficiency variation remains within 4.22% and ensures ZVS operation. Additional tests under coil misalignment confirm robust operation with efficiency above 89%, and detailed loss analysis shows that system losses were reduced by 29.1%, 25.22%, and 38.99% at load resistances of 20, 50, and 100 <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ω</b>, respectively."

Compared with the existing free-flying robots, FRDP achieves a significant reduction in weight and size by decreasing the redundancy of the propulsion module, while maintaining stronger mobility when carrying more sensing and computing modules. A new control allocation method for this dual-vectored propulsion structure is presented, enabling the generation of thrusts and torques in six degrees of freedom (DOFs) using four actuators. To adapt to various mission requirements, FRDP features both energy-saving mode and performance mode. The dynamic modeling and controller design for both modes are described, and the maneuvering performance and energy efficiency of the two modes are analyzed and compared. Simulation and real-world experimental results fully validate the effectiveness of the designed dual-vector propulsion structure and dual-modal controller, demonstrating FRDP’s potential for task execution in space station environments."

Comparisons to approximately 180 hours of in situ observations spanning various environmental conditions in the Southern North Sea yield an overall squared correlation coefficient of 0.93, and a normalized root-mean-square error of 16%. These results suggest that coherent marine radar offers a practical and relatively cost-efficient tool for observing key parameters related to ocean surface dynamics and air-sea interactions, such as whitecap coverage."

As of 2024, only 48 universities in the United States have ABET-accredited Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) undergraduate degrees. One of the accreditation criteria is for students to be able to conduct experiments, analyze data, and draw conclusions from the experiment, typically met through laboratory coursework. Understanding effective approaches to lab design is critical for developing new or revised MSEN curricula. To address this need, a systematic literature review was conducted to answer the following research question: What are the different types of laboratories used to teach materials science concepts? The review was guided by the principles of the Processing, Structure, Properties, and Performance (PSPP) framework and the Experiential Learning Theory (ELT). Articles reviewed for the study were searched using the Compendex and ERIC databases, resulting in search string that yielded 293 articles. Following the principles of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 articles were reviewed for the final synthesis. Open coding and thematic analysis were used for article synthesis. The three themes identified were in-person laboratories for students, computational laboratories for students, and project-based laboratories. All articles illustrated the integration of the four cycles of ELT with the PSPP framework, highlighting their benefit in designing lab courses. The paper serves as a resource for educators who are exploring possible ways to develop laboratory courses for MSEN undergraduate programs."

The research addresses the challenge of aligning workforce skills with regional economic transitions, particularly in areas shifting from resource-dependent industries to renewable energy for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The study employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract both explicit and implicit skills from unstructured text (CVs, job descriptions, course information) and map them to standardised ontologies. The methodology includes synthetic data generation, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Preliminary findings indicate that BERT-based models demonstrate superior performance in semantic understanding and comprehensive coverage (0.78 recall), while Generative models show strengths in precision (0.64) and ontology alignment when combined with contextual embeddings. The research contributes to workforce development by enabling personalised career guidance and reskilling recommendations that align with regional economic needs and sustainability goals."

    "abstract": "Efficient autonomous exploration in large-scale environments remains challenging due to high planning computational cost and low-speed maneuvers. In this article, we propose an efficient dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer planning method is efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily exploring the target in the first region of routing at high speed. Specifically, we propose a long-term region routing approximate algorithm, called “exploration-oriented heuristic double-tree algorithm”, to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments. Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the highest curvature-penalized score, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further speed up the exploration, we propose an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented trajectory planning approach to enhance exploration continuity and speed. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a transformer-based architecture for topology-aware federated learning, accompanied by a detailed elucidation of the framework. One of the anticipated uses for it is in large Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This strategy helps individuals learn by using graph-theoretic properties like degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality. Older systems used raw sensor data, but this approach is different. When every node in the network knew exactly what they were supposed to do and how they fit into the communication system, we knew we had attained our aim. Transformational topologies may illustrate both geographical and temporal connections while still keeping data safe. Training on the device itself makes this procedure feasible. You may use topology-weighted aggregation to incorporate local changes to a global model. You can modify the weights depending on how important the data is to the structure. This is one technique to make sure that the model is both robust and fair. The findings of this technique are better than those of the federated learning, graph-based, and transformer-based baselines when it comes to accuracy, progress, and growth. The findings were better in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) when training was cut back and transparency was increased. This design is great for Internet of Things devices that don't need a lot of processing power because it requires very little power and has very minimal reasoning latency. It can easily manage enormous networks and is robust even when it needs to deal with data that isn't IID, which is a serious concern for the economy. This is the best part. There are a number of potential strategies to improve the IIoT's federated learning. These include learning more about the structure, gaining more accurate representations, and following the advised steps. When all of these elements operate together, they produce a private system that can change and grow better at both operations and making predictions. Future intelligent IIoT systems could utilize this design to make informed decisions about dispersed industrial platforms."

    "abstract": "Vertical Split Federated Learning (VSFL) allows participants to collaboratively train a better model with different features vertically partitioned in the same sample space, where the model is divided into bottom model and top model by the cut layer, trained by passive and active participants respectively. However, in the process, the labels owned by the active participant will still be inferred or stolen by curious or malicious passive participants. In this paper, we propose Casper, a causality-inspired defense mechanism with a confounder against label inference attacks in VSFL. Casper first analyzes the feasibility of optimizing the training process in VSFL at the intervention level from a causal perspective. It then introduces a confounder consisting of cut layer output reconstruction and label obfuscation to disrupt the direct causality between cut layer outputs and labels. Additionally, we integrate selective discrepancy training to further ensure model utility by strategically balancing training between active and passive participants. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets across different tasks demonstrate that Casper effectively preserves label privacy while maintaining model performance, significantly outperforming current advanced defending methods in VSFL."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the ‘AI policy landscape’ and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers. Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version of the module, including a technical assignment on “AI regulation”. We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of ‘policy’ in addressing ethical challenges."

    "abstract": "This full research paper investigates how the emergence of large language model (LLM)-based tools has influenced student code submissions in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on programming. The rise of LLMs has introduced new opportunities and challenges in programming education, particularly regarding how students approach programming tasks. As code submissions can be used as artifacts representing the learning process, analyzing submissions before and after the wide-spread adoption of LLMs can provide insight into changes in how and whether students' approaches to solving programming tasks have changed and more broadly whether the way how programming is practiced has evolved. Using programming assignment submission data from two University-level programming MOOCs, we explore whether and to what extent code submissions have changed after the emergence of LLMs. Our analyses focus on quantitative metrics from the MOOCs, including number of submissions, code lengths, stylistic aspects, and code complexity and originality. Our results highlight that there are some differences in the high-level metrics extracted from submissions between the pre- and post-LLM era, although the differences are largely subtle. We discuss possible reasons for the subtle differences."

    "abstract": "The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and e-Governance promises unprecedented efficiency and personalization in public service delivery. However, the proliferation of AI, particularly models reliant on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automating administrative tasks, citizen interaction, and policy analysis, introduces significant challenges pertaining to transparency, accountability, and data integrity. The “black-box” nature of complex NLP models and the potential for algorithmic bias can erode public trust in automated government systems. This paper proposes a novel integrative framework that leverages blockchain technology to introduce a layer of immutable transparency and verifiable auditability to AI-enabled eGovernance. We elucidate how blockchain's distributed ledger can be utilized to create tamper-proof records of NLP model training data, model versions, decision-making processes, and citizen-government interactions. The integration ensures that every AI-driven outcome, from a automated service request classification to a sentiment analysis of public feedback, is traceable and auditable against an immutable chain of evidence. This research delineates the architectural principles for such a synthesis, discusses key implementation challenges, including scalability and privacy, and posits that the blockchain-NLP synergy is not merely supplementary but foundational for building next-generation, transparent, and trustworthy AIdriven public sector institutions."

However, the demands of the classroom prevent teachers from staying up-todate with the latest trends. One solution to this issue is to create collaboration opportunities with STEM researchers where teachers can learn about the researchers' work and help the researchers translate their research to the K-12 classroom, such as part of an educational outreach project. These collaborations can improve the engagement of the STEM classroom and potentially encourage more students to pursue STEM careers."

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the design of a user control device for a telemanipulation system in the form of a wearable full-arm exoskeleton in the user’s right arm with an implementation of a force feedback and joint restriction mechanism. The problem with the current telemanipulation controllers is that they lack the degrees of freedom (DoF) to encompass the entire arm for control, and at the same time provide insufficient or no feedback mechanism to simulate the feeling of grasping and touching objects from a robot arm to the hand. The prototype is a 3D printed wearable device embedded on a combined glove and arm sleeve made of cloth, spanning from the fingertips to the shoulder. It uses retractable strings to measure flexing of the joints, a wrench mechanism for the shoulder, and a combination of the MPU6050 and HMC5883L for wrist roll motion. To restrict the joints, MG996R motors are used to counter the rotation of their connected strings by rotating in the opposite direction to their motion. In addition, vibration motors are at the fingertips. Tests had shown that the error between the actual and measured flexing angles is within 5% acceptance, along with a delay of less than 100ms for transmission distances within 10m."

In the health sector, forecasting staff turnover requires models that are accurate and interpretable. This research utilizes a Hybrid Attention-based Deep Neural Network (HADNN) that combines TabNet feature encoding with an Attention Residual Fully Connected Network (AR-FCN). Whereas TabNet is beneficial when it comes to sparse hierarchical feature selection, AR-FCN uses residual attention for improved gradient stability and representation learning. The model was trained and validated on a healthcare staff dataset containing 15,238 records and 42 features. Cross-validation and SMOTE balancing is utilized during the validation. With an F 1 -score of 0.96, an AUC value of 0.98, and an accuracy rate of 96.8%, the developed HADNN performed better than Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, and TabNet alone in predicting results. The workload index, tenure length, and stress index are the highest three parameters in the feature importance ranking. The findings show that HADNN makes forecasts that are interpretable, accurate, and stable, which are beneficial for healthcare workforce management decisions."

Various MP schemes at joint velocity and acceleration levels are reported, but the noise impact is usually neglected. This paper presents an enhanced version of the acceleration-level MP (ALMP) method, incorporating additive noise considerations, specifically designed for robotic manipulators. Then, such an improved method, which is based on the pseudoinverse of robots’ Jacobian matrix, is theoretically proven to be robust against different types of noise. As case studies of the improved method, the noise-tolerance repetitive motion planning (NT-RMP) and the noise-tolerance minimum acceleration norm (NT-MAN) scheme are established for robot manipulators. Simulation and experiment results under the UR5 and Panda robot manipulators corrupted by different noises further validate the effectiveness and practicality of such two schemes and the improved ALMP method."

By means of the first-order sensitivity theory, the influence of three commonly used objective functions on the parameter identification performance of the load model is evaluated from three dimensions: the convergence speed of parameter identification, the stability of the output curve, and the noise adaptability. The evaluation results show that the mean square error and root mean square error perform better in terms of the convergence speed of parameter identification and the stability of the output curve, while the mean absolute error has stronger robustness and adaptability in a noisy environment. Through simulation analysis, conclusions consistent with the theoretical evaluation results are obtained."

After watching the video, students were grouped and took turns selecting and answering questions. If a complete response was given, the group received full points for that question, while partial answers earned fewer points. At the end, the group with the highest score was declared the winner and awarded a prize. Evaluation of this method showed that it not only increased student focus, motivation and interaction but also supported review and reinforcement of educational content.

Conventional security solutions are frequently ineffective in handling mezzo-day attacks, insiders and vulnerabilities of quantum kind. In an attempt to counter these shortcomings, this paper introduces new mitigation method in Intelligent Quantum-Resilient Adaptive Defense Mechanism (IQ-ADM). Proposed reinforcement tool integrates the deep reinforcement learning into the tool to permit adaptive and independent threat detection with the emergence and homomorphic encryption may secure privacy with analytics across many nodes. In addition, quantum-safe cryptography primitives are added in such a way that, to provide resilience to attacks by future quantum computing. The system relies on the concept of federated learning to analyze user behavior, traffic patterns, and infrastructure utilization without sharing valuable raw information and therefore offer an ideal balance of safety and consistency. It employs a trust management layer, used as a blockchain boosts data integrity and responsibility in the communications between the nodes and a dynamic policy engine, powered by game-theoretic optimal assignment of defensive resources. IQ-ADM provides an upgradable cryptography defense system that can sustain the key workloads of the existing cloud eco-sphere with the advantages of state-current adaptive intelligence. The outcomes indicate that this solution is a solution to the major security issues, as the protection is solid and will withstand under the fluctuating and risky conditions in cloud computing environments. The suggested framework attains an overall accuracy of 96.2% proving its efficacy in secure cloud computing settings."

    "abstract": "In industrial automation, validating processes against required protocols is crucial for ensuring correct operations. This paper presents a novel, formally grounded, pattern-based approach to protocol checking that models manufacturing process steps as composable patterns built from domain-specific primitives representing workcenters and carriers. The approach supports both positive (desired) and negative (forbidden) patterns, enabling dual-mode validation of process sequences. This structured approach enhances modularity, scalability, and adaptability across diverse manufacturing environments. The pattern-matching mechanism is formalized as a lightweight, domain-aligned runtime-verification model and deployed across multiple European manufacturing plants. Empirical analysis shows a statistically significant reduction in fault rates ($\\mathbf{p}=0.0383$), with average fault rates dropping from 8.81% to 0.27% following deployment. These results demonstrate the protocol checker’s effectiveness in detecting violations, identifying root causes, and improving process reliability. This work provides a practical and flexible alternative to traditional formal verification."

This study aims to simultaneously analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of these three diseases and estimate their relative risks using a Bayesian Joint Spatio-Temporal Model. The model incorporates shared and disease-specific spatial and temporal effects, with parameter estimation performed through the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Secondary data from BPJS Kesehatan covering 35 districts and cities in Central Java for the period 2019–2023 were analyzed. Results showed that Hepatitis B & C had the highest shared spatial effect $\\left( {\\delta _2^S = 0.434} \\right)$, indicating strong geographic risk factors, while Tuberculosis exhibited the highest shared temporal effect $\\left( {\\delta _3^T = 0.614} \\right)$, reflecting substantial dependence on temporal dynamics. Relative risks (RR) for HIV/AIDS were elevated in Surakarta City, Salatiga City, and Sukoharjo, whereas Hepatitis B & C consistently showed high risks in Surakarta City, Semarang City, and Salatiga City. Tuberculosis displayed high risks across most regions, with extreme values in Magelang City, Tegal City, and Kudus. Posterior probabilities that RR > 1 supported these findings, particularly for Tuberculosis (p > 0.9). These results underscore the concentrated disease burden in urban areas and highlight the need for spatio-temporal based interventions, including active screening, integrated services, and more effective control strategies in priority regions."

In this study, we compared a custom CNN built just for this task with a well-known model called ResNet-18, using the Stanford Dogs dataset. We trained both models in exactly the same way so the comparison would be fair. Our custom CNN reached 66.46% accuracy, while ResNet-18 reached 80.82%, showing that large pre-trained models are much better at noticing tiny differences between similar breeds. When we looked at the mistakes, we saw that the models often mixed up breeds that look alike, such as Siberian Huskies and Eskimo Dogs. We also tested how stable the models were in different conditions and found almost no accuracy change (only 0.40%) between indoor and outdoor photos. To make the models more efficient, we removed 30% of the channels in ResNet-18, which caused only a small 1.49% accuracy drop but still allowed it to run quickly on a mobile CPU at about 64.31 milliseconds per image. These results show the balance between accuracy, speed, and readiness for real-world use in fine-grained image tasks. Our evaluation setup gives helpful guidance for designing strong and efficient dog-breed classifiers, and future improvements could involve mixing custom and pre-trained layers, using smarter hardware-friendly pruning, and adding explanation tools to make the predictions easier to understand."

The transition to autonomous systems introduces significant operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. Accurate modeling and prediction of IIoT energy requirements are critical, but traditional physics- and engineering-based approaches often fall short in addressing these challenges comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for benchmarking and analyzing IIoT devices and applications to uncover insights into their power demands, energy consumption, and performance. To demonstrate this methodology, we develop a comprehensive framework and apply it to study an industrial CPS comprising an educational robotic arm, a conveyor belt, a smart camera, and a compute node. By creating micro-benchmarks and an end-to-end application within this framework, we create an extensive performance and power consumption dataset, which we use to train and analyze ML models for predicting energy usage from features of the application and the CPS system. The proposed methodology and framework provide valuable insights into the energy dynamics of industrial CPS, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of IIoT-driven automation."

Addressing the limitations inherent in conventional assembly teaching methods, this study aims to analyze their impact on users physiological responses (heart rate) and mental workload (NASA-TLX). A comparative experimental design was employed by dividing the participants into AR and non AR groups. Heart rate measurements were obtained during the preexperiment, experimental, and post-experiment phases, whereas mental workload assessments were conducted post-experiment using the NASA-TLX instrument. Although the heart rate analysis did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups, the consistent heart rate patterns observed across all phases indicated physiological responses related to task demands when using multimedia services. Conversely, mental workload results showed that AR users reported significantly lower NASA-TLX scores (M = 15.8660) than the non AR group (M = 38.9340), (t(df) = -3.273(4.191), p = 0.029). These findings highlight the effectiveness of AR as a multimedia service capable of optimizing cognitive load during the learning process. As an initial study, this research provides valuable insights into the physiological effects and mental workload of AR, thereby contributing to the development of the literature on multimedia services and applications in education. In addition, these results can serve as a reference for the development of more effective AR-based learning services in the future."

    "abstract": "This paper provides an in-depth discussion of ML (machine learning) algorithms to identify threats in cloud computing infrastructure, with a specific focus on intelligent detection of anomalies, intrusions, and malicious behaviors in dynamic cloud networking conditions. The suggested architecture applies a hybrid architecture with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to evaluate beginning and ending temporal behavior. A database containing <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 0, 0 0 0}$</tex> samples of network traffic (normal operation and threatinduced operation) was referenced in the form of a cloud database. Preprocessing methods such as normalization and feature selection through Recursive FIre Elimination (RFE) method served data preprocessing. Experimental analysis revealed that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model had an Accuracy of 98.3 % and a Precision of 97.6%, a Recall of 98.1, and a False Alarm rate (FAR) of 1.2, although compared with the traditional algorithms like SVM and random forest, the hybrid model highly surpassed them in accuracy, precision, recall, and FAR. The proposed plan is quite adaptable to evolving threat profiles and inter-cross-live relations between virtual machine generations. Overall, the results prove the model is effective in deploying cloud services that are resilient to and secure against advanced attack-based bases."

    "abstract": "While routing methods in the literature often assume the use of quantum memory, this study proposes a routing algorithm designed for memoryless quantum networks. The algorithm leverages lexicographic optimization principles to hierarchically prioritize and optimize multiple objectives such as distance and capacity. This approach identifies the shortest paths between source-destination pairs within the decoherence time and selects a path that satisfies the minimum capacity require ments. To prevent entanglement fidelity from dropping below the desired threshold, purification is applied. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to manage latency while enhancing throughput effectively. The study comprehensively analyzes performance metrics under varying capacity values, request numbers, and threshold fidelity levels. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to calculate latency, including queuing delay, in the context of quantum networks. Future research aims to explore optimal threshold fidelity values that balance throughput and latency performance."

    "abstract": "Ransomware attacks have emerged as a significant threat, but has this new mode of attack transformed the economic calculus of cybersecurity? Before the emergence of ransomware, vulnerabilities could be characterized largely as having high negative network externalities while also creating risks for vulnerable parties. However, with ransomware’s rise, attackers can more directly extract payments from victims. Such a shift may change negative externalities into directly tangible and quantifiable costs for affected firms.To investigate whether ransomware victims internalize these costs, we compute Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) around ransomware disclosure dates. Specifically, we leverage an event-study methodology to estimate CARs across multiple event windows for publicly traded firms affected by ransomware and compare these effects against prior findings in the cybersecurity finance literature. Our results show that firms in the critical manufacturing sector experience negative returns, whereas firms in the information technology and communications sector exhibit comparatively mild effects and a faster recovery trajectory, often showing positive cumulative abnormal returns in longer windows.Our findings illuminate an important difference in how the market reacts to ransomware incidents in different sectors. However, our findings could also imply that standard market valuations may understate the full economic impact of such incidents, failing to incentivize adequate investment in risk remediation."

With the increasing demand for cloud services, efficient task scheduling has become critical to ensure optimal performance, balanced resource utilization, and reduced energy consumption. This study proposes the integration of the Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA) with Elite Opposition-Based Learning (EOBL) to improve task scheduling in cloud computing environments. The simulation was conducted using CloudSim, configured with $\\mathbf{5 4}$ virtual machines, 18 hosts, and 6 datacenters. Three datasets were employed: the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Blue Horizon logs, a simple random dataset, and a stratified random dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LOA outperforms the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in several parameters, including average execution time and imbalance degree. Furthermore, the hybrid LOA-EOBL significantly enhances scheduling performance across multiple criteria, such as makespan, total wait time, average start and finish times, scheduling length, throughput, resource utilization, and energy consumption. The improvements are consistent across all datasets, with notable advantages observed in complex workloads represented by the SDSC dataset. These findings highlight the potential of LOA-EOBL as an effective hybrid optimization method for cloud task scheduling, offering improvements in efficiency, fairness, and sustainability compared to traditional approaches."

    "abstract": "Human emotions are intensively shown through facial expressions. However, in the real world, many images are only with partial or occluded faces, or even with unavailable faces; whereas these images contain/express emotions in them. This paper explores the feasibility of recognizing emotions on faceless images using deep learning techniques. This research aims to compare the performance of Inception and Baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in recognizing emotions from images, specifically focusing on photos and paintings. Inception models, known for their superior performance in image classification tasks, have shown promise in emotion recognition. However, the effectiveness of these models compared to baseline CNNs in the context of emotion detection remains to be explored. By conducting a quantitative analysis of both models, this research seeks to determine which architecture is more suitable for accurately recognizing emotions in images. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate emotion recognition systems, particularly in applications such as social media platforms, where automatic tagging of images can enhance user experience and content discovery."

Accurate grading is crucial and relies heavily on identifying mitotic figures in histopathology slides, a task that’s both tedious and prone to human error. In this work, we propose a fully automated pipeline using YOLOv8 for mitosis detection in whole-slide images. We divide high-resolution slides into 512×512 patches, remove background-heavy ones, and apply stain normalization for consistency. These patches are then processed using YOLOv8, enhanced with mosaic augmentation and an anchor-free head for fast and precise detection. Trained on the MITOS-ATYPIA-14 dataset, our model achieved 95.2% mAP@0.5, 90.3% precision, and 92.8% recall overall. For non-mitotic nuclei, precision reached 96.4%, while true mitotic figures showed 84.2% precision and 92.4% recall competitive with or better than existing methods. We also introduce a lightweight interface for expert review and feedback, making this solution both accurate and practical for real-world breast cancer diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Wind power technology continues to advance, while viable development areas are becoming increasingly scarce. Consequently, the exploitation of wind resources in high-altitude regions is gaining significant attention. However, the complex topography and highly variable meteorological conditions in these areas result in wind characteristics that differ markedly from those at lower altitudes. Applying conventional missing data imputation methods from wind resource assessment can lead to substantial errors. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical imputation model called WSTC-HI, based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of high-altitude wind resources, addressing the collaborative filling of missing values in multi-height-layer wind resource data at high altitudes. By effectively reconstructing missing values using existing wind measurement data, this model resolves the difficulty of filling multi-height wind speed data gaps in high-altitude regions, which arises from the complex vertical structure and strong temporal dependency of wind resources. Given the pronounced vertical structure and strong temporal dependence of wind resources in high-altitude regions, raw wind speed data is clustered into multiple wind conditions using clustering algorithms. A reference height is selected within each cluster, and the Reformer model is employed for long-sequence modeling. Its locally sensitive hash attention mechanism and enhanced reversible residual network robustly handle complex missing patterns. Concurrently, wind shear index is utilized to achieve collaborative imputation of wind speeds across multiple height layers. Compared to Reformer imputation model, this model achieves a 11.6% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) for imputation results and demonstrates significantly improved accuracy."

In order to further improve the prediction ability of transformer faults, this paper proposes a combined prediction model based on variational modal decomposition and cnn-gru-ed to predict transformer errors in the ultra short term. First of all, in view of the problem that the error related feature set of transformer is too complex, this paper selects the high correlation features through correlation analysis; Secondly, this paper introduces particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the parameters of VMD, and then decomposes and reconstructs the historical error and relevant feature sequences; Then, CNN-GRU-ED prediction models are established for each reconstructed signal to predict. Finally, the prediction results are superimposed to obtain the final prediction results. This paper takes the test data of a substation as an example, and compares it with direct prediction, recursive prediction and multi input and multi output models in single-step and multi-step prediction respectively. The results show that the model proposed in this paper is better than other models in prediction effect."

    "abstract": "This research proposes a biophysically informed diffusion transformer paradigm to assess tailored therapy efficacy in diverse tumor settings. Combining genetic, geographical, and therapeutic data is tricky, but this research successfully accomplishes it. Divide the tumor into cells or areas to start the multi-stage computer pipeline. It then records geographic and molecular heterogeneity using multi-omics, imaging, and phenotypic data. Graph-based models track whether molecules are comparable between nodes and spatially close. Node embeddings and edge properties are processed using diffusion-weighted aggregation and multi-head attention. Biophysical constraints enable realistic molecular propagation, and drug-target interactions generate a drug-aware graph. Patient-specific data helps the algorithm learn from clinical and experimental results, improving predictions. The model was compared to graph-based approaches and attention-enhanced transformers using many criteria. Prediction accuracy, MSE, AUCC, F1-score, calibration error, convergence time, and computing efficiency were considered. Regular graph models performed poorly, with prediction accuracy between <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$82\\%$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$84\\%$</tex>.

These results demonstrate that the framework can correctly reproduce tumor settings and include patient-specific drug-target interactions and feedback. This strategy produces a simple, scalable, and therapeutically relevant precision oncology tool. It advances predictive computer medicine by helping clinicians choose the best treatment for each patient."

Furthermore, the model achieves superior ranking accuracy (96%) and alert efficiency (95%), ensuring effective prioritization of critical threats in real-time. These findings validate the model as a robust, adaptive, and context-aware solution for strengthening IoT cybersecurity against evolving advanced persistent threats."

    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, training and test data are often collected in diverse settings, leading to domain shifts arising from evolving environments and selection bias. While causality-inspired methods have shown promising results in tackling the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization issue, prior methods treat the discovered differences across domains as confounding variables. While effective in handling domain differences (i.e., unseen environmental features in test data), they may fail when confronted with intricate spurious correlations in real-world datasets. In this study, we first analyze this limitation to inadequate modeling of causal intervention and derive the OOD generalization bound to explain the challenges it introduces. To address this problem, we propose a modified causal intervention approach to mitigate various types of confounders. Motivated by the mathematical formulation of our modified causal intervention, we introduce the Causal Feature Selection Module (CFSM) to suppress model weights on both domain-differences features and spurious correlation features. Integrated within the Base Feature Extraction Module, In-Sample Module, and Cross-Sample Module (B-I-C architecture), CFSM collectively neutralizes the confounding effects arising from both domain discrepancies and correlation distinctions, thereby achieving causal feature selection. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the proposed CFSM method can achieve strictly lower OOD errors. Further experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to previous deconfounding methods, our method not only mitigates the effect of domain-differences features but also the hard-to-identify spurious correlation features, achieving significant improvements in two-dimensional OOD generalization."

Scrum, one of the most widely adopted agile frameworks in the software industry, remains challenging to teach due to its practical and team-based nature. Educational digital games have emerged as promising tools to bridge this gap by offering experiential and engaging learning environments. This systematic literature review examines 22 peer-reviewed studies that explore the use of digital games to teach Scrum concepts, roles, and practices in higher education and professional contexts. The analysis reveals a growing diversity of technological platforms, including web-based simulations, and immersive virtual reality. Most games focus on simulating core Scrum events such as Sprint Planning, Review, and Retrospective, often through active learning and gamification mechanics. However, gaps remain in the simulation of the whole Scrum framework and advanced practices (e.g., Planning Poker, role-specific tasks), in multiplayer experiences, and especially in conducting rigorous empirical validations. Findings highlight the motivational benefits of using serious games for Scrum education, while also underscoring the need for more rigorous research designs and broader implementation. Future work should focus on comprehensive, pedagogically grounded games that are empirically validated and leverage emerging technologies for scalable, collaborative, and realistic Scrum training."

The proposed EchoVision system measures the distance of objects in the user's path precisely by using an ESP32 microprocessor and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. When it detects an obstruction within a preset range, it immediately sounds a buzzer to alert the user. The device's design places a high premium on user comfort, portability, and energy efficiency. It is a small wearable device that runs on a 9V battery and has an integrated buck converter to maintain a constant voltage. The system is capable of more than just detecting obstacles. It also has a web-based interface that uses Firebase integration to provide cloud-based navigation support and turn-by-turn voice directions using GPS tracking and speech synthesis. The system can detect obstacles with a mean absolute percentage error of 2.25% over distances of 10 to 200 cm, respond in real time with a system latency of less than 150 milliseconds, and be accepted by users in controlled trials with visually impaired participants, according to experimental validation. The prototype overcomes major problems with traditional mobility aids like white canes and guide dogs by making it easier to see obstacles at head and chest level while keeping the cost low and making it easy to get for a lot of people, especially in developing countries. User feedback shows that 80% of people find the system easy to use, which shows that it could be a useful assistive technology for helping blind people move around on their own and live better lives."

The study outlines a novel hybrid methodology for customer segmentation that integrates Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), utilizing age, spending score, session time, and purchase frequency as parameters. While GMM adapts for flexible and probabilistic customer classification, DBSCAN serves to eliminate noise and discover core centre groupings. The clusters showed significant differences from one another. One cluster, for example, demonstrated high spending, long session time, and a high frequency of purchases, which showed engagement and value. The method improves the precision of the segmentation and gives clear and practical recommendations for marketing campaigns, customer retention strategies, and efficient budgeting. The study proved that a combination of density and probabilistic approaches is effective for analyzing customer diversity and behavioral patterns."

    "abstract": "Facial attribute prediction is central to advancing human–computer interaction, affective computing, and socially responsible AI. Conventional single-task models, which separately predict age, gender, or emotion, often suffer from limited generalization, inefficiency, and demographic bias. This work proposes a lightweight multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) that jointly predicts age, gender, and emotion using shared feature representations. The framework integrates strong data augmentation, adversarial training, and fairness-aware strategies to enhance robustness under variations in pose, illumination, and occlusion while reducing demographic disparities. To enable real-world usability, pruning and quantization are applied to design compact models suitable for deployment on mobile and IoT devices. The proposed method is validated on two benchmark datasets: UTKFace for age and gender, and CK+ for emotion recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the multitask approach consistently outperforms single-task baselines, achieving improved accuracy across all three attributes while reducing fairness gaps between demographic groups. The model also maintains high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, which enables a real-time inference on platofrms that have some resource constraints. These findings highlight the potential of multi-task CNNs as a practical and equitable solution for various applications."

    "abstract": "This full research paper explores the perspectives of Computer Science (CS) and Public Policy (PPOL) graduate students on the presence of embodied AI systems (i.e., AI-powered robots) in public spaces. Robots in public spaces pose unique challenges due to their embodiment, emergence, and social valence, raising societal, ethical, and regulatory concerns. These challenges disrupt established legal norms, requiring nuanced policies. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, public concern about its societal impact grows, emphasizing the need for robust technology policies and ethical education. Research shows that public perceptions of AI are often more negative than views on algorithms, associating AI with fear and uncertainty. While studies address public perceptions of AI, little research focuses on how future technologists and policymakers perceive embodied AI and its challenges. To address this, we used the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to investigate CS and PPOL students' views on concerning robots and related policy issues. Through semi-structured interviews with three CS and four PPOL graduate students, we identified five categories of concerning robots, with self-driving cars and humanoid robots being the most prominent. We examined 10 policy challenges, 16 policy solutions, and the roles of key stakeholders. These findings offer insights into interdisciplinary education, AI policy development, and robotics literacy, fostering collaboration between technical and societal fields and preparing students to develop ethical AI technologies and informed public policies."

    "abstract": "Frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar is a cornerstone of advanced driver assistance systems thanks to its low cost and resilience to adverse weather. Yet the absence of explicit semantics makes radar annotation difficult, and the scarcity of large-scale labeled data limits the performance of radar perception models. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised framework for object detection directly from Range–Azimuth– Doppler (RAD) cubes that learns transferable representations from unlabeled radar data. Specifically, we introduce cross-view contrastive learning to model correspondences among complementary views of the RAD cube, encouraging the network to capture spatial structure from multiple perspectives. In addition, an auxiliary cross-modal contrastive objective distills semantic knowledge from vision into radar. The joint objective integrates cross-view and cross-modal signals to strengthen radar feature representations. We further extend the framework to cross-domain pretraining using datasets from different sources. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves radar object detection performance, especially with limited labeled data."

To increase discriminability across motor tasks, EMG features were extracted and fused at the feature-level in time and frequency domains. The proposed hybrid architecture contains Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers. Twelve healthy subjects executed six action trials all including grip (low, medium, strong), wrist flexion/extension, and elbow flexion/extension. The hybrid RF-CNN-ANN had an overall accuracy of 53.4% compared to 15% for a single ANN, and 48% for a single RF framework. Results indicated fuming EMG features across regions improved recognition performance and robustness compared to one region, demonstrating a desirable first step toward considering intelligent rehabilitation and prosthetic -control."

However, many state-of-the-art deep learning models are computationally expensive due to their reliance on standard convolutions with varying kernel sizes. In this paper, we analyze the effect of various advanced convolution operations with different kernel sizes for feature extraction in a state-of-the-art light field disparity estimation network. Based on this investigation, we propose an optimized mixed convolution layer to extract relevant features using multiple kernel sizes in parallel, while maintaining significantly lower computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces model complexity by up to 4.2× while also improving disparity estimation accuracy. These findings make the proposed convolutional operation more practical for light field applications, where efficient spatial and angular feature extraction is essential for improved model performance."

Dual Gaussian processing, CLAHE, and the wavelet based fusion process the image generating superior outputs that can be used in specific segmentation. MCWT subsequently divides the region of interest into liver and other foreground elements with the help of the watershed and foreground estimation principles. Using the LiTS comparison of the system has revealed an enormous progress in terms of accuracy and computational complexity in the element of segmentation. In comparison to conventional and deep learning-based approaches, the method resulted in a DICE of 0.948, Jaccard Index of 0.901, VOE of 0.080 and RVD of 0.093 with less segmentation time of 2.3 seconds. The result indeed shows that MDSGF-MCWT method has been efficient and capable of a sound solution to liver segmentation, even in errored/noisy or weak contrasted images."

The research relies on the Convey Law and explores how communication patterns are developed that impact on the clarity of backlog and prioritization. A survey of 467 agile practitioners was carried out quantitatively in various industries and the data obtained were analyzed with the help of MANOVA, chi-square and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in order to establish the factors that influence backlog efficiency. Findings have shown that the hierarchical nature of an organization has a strong influence on decision-making processes, whereas the active involvement of stakeholders and the wider application of communication instruments can contribute to a better understanding of a backlog and the stability of its priorities. These relationships are strong in the post-COVID remote and hybrid environments, which proves the Law of Conway to be still relevant in modern agile environments. The paper provides reallife advice on how to improve alignment, minimize the number of communication bottlenecks, and reinforce the distributed backlog practices. The next generation needs to consider AI-based prioritization systems, cross-cultural virtual teams, and how to create adaptive structures of globally distributed agile teams."

Experiential learning-particularly internships and real-world project engagements-has emerged as one of the most promising pedagogical methods for building sustainability-related competencies. This paper synthesizes insights from leading Scopus-, Web of Science-, and ABDCindexed research to examine how experiential learning nurtures skills such as systems thinking, strategic sustainability judgement, ethical reasoning, collaboration, and integrated problem-solving. Previous research [5], [6], [12]; consistently demonstrates that students who actively confront authentic sustainability challenges exhibit enhanced learning, more professional maturity, and a stronger dedication to sustainable practices. Recent developments in responsible management education and circular operations further substantiate these patterns. The research strongly shows that well-structured experiential pedagogies should be regarded as fundamental elements of management curriculum rather than mere supplemental learning opportunities"

    "abstract": "Creating effective slide presentations requires adapting both content and structure to match the communication context e.g. whether the presentation is for summarizing to executives, or reporting progress to research supervisors. In research and enterprise environments, this need for context-sensitive presentations often leads to repeated, manual reformatting of the same material to suit different audiences. Existing generative systems support slide creation but typically rely on structured inputs, assume a fixed format, and offer limited ability to iteratively refine outputs through natural language feedback. Moreover, they rarely accommodate organizational constraints such as formatting guidelines, domain-specific terminology, or branding requirements. We present SlideCraft, a context-aware generative agent that autonomously creates and edits slide presentations based on natural language instructions. SlideCraft infers the intended presentation context, such as an “executive-facing” or a “project review” summary for technical oversight, and selects the appropriate slide template. It then synthesizes content from input documents, enriches it with external knowledge and internal assets, assembles it into a structured intermediate representation, and generates a validated slide deck. SlideCraft supports both, first-time slide creation and iterative updates, operating through familiar natural language interfaces like email or messaging tools. Our experiments demonstrate that SlideCraft consistently produces high-quality, context-aware presentations tailored to diverse communication settings, with minimal human input and reliable adherence to enterprise constraints."

    "abstract": "Traditional metrics in system identification— such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)—quantify prediction accuracy and parsimony but do not assess the temporal structure left in residuals, a core indicator of whether a model has extracted all systematic dynamics. We introduce the Cumulative Correlation Violation (CCV), a lightweight residual diagnostic that sums the absolute autocorrelation coefficients exceeding the 95% white-noise bounds (±1.96/√N) across L lags, with O(N•L) complexity. CCV was evaluated with MLP–NARX models on two chaotic benchmarks: the Mackey–Glass (MG) delay system and the Rössler attractor (RA). Under a small hyperparameter search, the MG model (p*=8, 32 hidden; 353 params) attains low errors (MSE: 1.294×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> training and validation, 1.439×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> test) and strongly negative AIC (−1.41×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> training and validation; −2.96×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> test); yet CCV remains moderate (6.99 training and validation; 6.59 test), revealing subtle but statistically significant low-lag dependencies that error magnitude alone would miss. For RA (p*=10, 20 hidden; 241 parameters), performance degrades from training and validation to test (MSE: 1.16×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> → 1.67×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>; AIC: −1.90×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> → −1.84×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>) and CCV stays elevated (4.00 training and validation; 4.24 test), aligning with visible residual structure in ACF/CCF plots and indicating under-specification for the 3-state dynamics. Across both systems, CCV complements MSE/AIC by directly quantifying residual \"whiteness,\" enabling practitioners to diagnose subtle misspecification in otherwise accurate models and to confirm fundamental failures when generalization deteriorates— providing a practical objective for balancing accuracy, complexity, and residual quality in nonlinear system identification."

This article presents a model, the Neuro-Semantic Synergic Orchestrator (NSSO), a high-level cognitive model, which means the reasoner combines both neuro-symbolic reasoning and context-sensitive orchestration. The NSSO uses an integrative perception layer, which combines heterogeneous data, including sensory, behavioral cues and environmental, into single with regard to situational embeddings. These embeddings are fed into a Hybrid Site-Muscular Encoder which consists of extracting latent intent, relational bonds, and operational synergies using transformer-generated attention and graph reasoning. The Dynamic Synergy Engine is an engine that continuously re-configures resource flows, service pattern, and experiential parameter based on a process of optimization by reinforcement. The NSSO is unique in the sense that, unlike the traditional predictive systems, it develops and adapts to new semantic calibration, and it therefore has the ability of learning new implicit human and environmental correlation as time progresses. Experimental simulations show that the framework improves the situational awareness, lessens cognitive latency in adapting processes, and improves using experience to make personalization. The given architecture offers the basis of autonomous cognitive ecosystems that can transform various domains of service with sustainable transformation and data-driven data transformation. The suggested NSSO system attained an overall operational accuracy of 93.8 percent, demonstrating its exceptional dependability and precision in adaptable decision orchestrating."

However, emerging applications such as edge computing and cross-modal reasoning expose ResNet to challenges including dynamic task generalization, feature alignment across modalities, and lightweight deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in ResNet and its fusion applications. It first analyzes the architectural evolution of ResNet from the perspectives of gradient optimization and degradation mitigation. In the domain of medical imaging, it evaluates the effectiveness of transfer learning and meta-learning frameworks-such as MetaLR-in small-sample scenarios. For cross-modal fusion, it investigates the integration of ResNet with Transformers and graph neural networks, highlighting both collaborative mechanisms and computational bottlenecks. Although strategies such as multi-scale modeling and attention mechanisms have improved performance, ResNet still faces limitations in longrange dependency modeling, adaptive training, and efficient reasoning under resource constraints. Future research should emphasize lightweight architecture design, modality-aware alignment, and incremental learning strategies to enhance its adaptability to multi-modal and edge-oriented tasks."

    "abstract": "Accurate recognition of human physical activities is essential for continuous fitness monitoring, particularly in prehabilitation and post-operative rehabilitation programs for surgical patients. As the demand for surgical interventions increases and healthcare resources remain limited, remote monitoring has emerged as a scalable and effective solution. However, unsupervised activity recognition methods in this context are still underdeveloped, hindered by challenges such as inconsistent connectivity, privacy concerns, and the absence of standardised monitoring frameworks. This study investigates the influence of three data types—personalised, non-personalised, and categorised—on the accuracy of physical activity recognition within the Any-Time Any-Where Prehabilitation and Rehabilitation (ATAW-RHB) framework. By analysing patient-specific movement data, the study evaluates recognition rates for three common activities: cycling, rowing, and walking, across various intensity levels. Findings demonstrate that personalised data significantly improves recognition accuracy, achieving up to 96.8% for cycling, while lower accuracy was observed for walking (approximately 70%). These results highlight the critical role of personalisation in enhancing recognition performance, improving monitoring transparency, and enabling more tailored and effective remote care. The proposed approach contributes to the advancement of remote patient monitoring systems by establishing a data-driven foundation for personalised healthcare delivery. It supports healthcare providers in optimising care strategies while reducing patient burden and minimising the need for frequent hospital visits."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of data-driven services such as cloud computing, IoT, and video streaming demands highly reliable and high-speed optical broadband networks. However, system performance is limited by impairments such as noise, dispersion, and nonlinearities, which lead to higher bit error rates (BER). Error control coding (ECC) offers an effective solution, though trade-offs exist between complexity, latency, and coding gain. This study presents an optimization framework that integrates ECC with machine learning (ML), specifically a Random Forest (RF) classifier, to enhance physical-layer reliability and adaptive decision-making. Using simulations of 16-QAM over an AWGN channel, three schemes were evaluated: uncoded, Hamming (7,4), and convolutional coding. Results show that convolutional coding achieved the most significant improvement, providing the lowest BER, highest coding gain, and superior Q-factor across the 0–12 dB SNR range, while Hamming coding offered moderate performance enhancement. The RF classifier effectively categorized link quality (Good, Marginal, Poor) with 95% accuracy, achieving macro-averaged precision of 0.926, recall of 0.956, and F1-score of 0.935. These findings demonstrate that the synergy between ECC and ML not only reduces errors and improves signal quality but also enables intelligent, adaptive network operation, making the approach promising for next-generation high-speed optical broadband systems."

All EfficientNet models are compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to determine the most accurate and efficient architecture. The results show that EfficientNet B7 achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 0.93598 $(93.598 \\%)$, precision of $0.93572(93.572 \\%)$, and recall of $0.93398(93.398 \\%)$, followed closely by EfficientNet B2 with an accuracy of $0.93445(93.445 \\%)$. These findings highlight the potential of implementing deep learning models such as EfficientNet in real-world medical applications, as they offer an optimal balance between accuracy and computational cost. Furthermore, the study suggests that early diagnosis-and potentially future integration into treatment planning-of brain tumor patients can be enhanced through AI-based medical imaging systems."

    "abstract": "Recently, the continuous expansion of forest areas has imposed new demands on forest fire prevention systems. However, the characteristics of weak textures and high dynamics associated with smoke and fire have rendered many traditional pose recovery methods ineffective. Building upon conventional learning-based Visual Odometry (VO) approaches, we focus on feature point tracking as our primary strategy. By incorporating temporal information from sequential images into the trajectory prediction pipeline, we achieve more accurate pose estimations through temporal modeling of feature points and trajectory filtering. We conducted experiments on a challenging virtual forest dataset, demonstrating that our method outperforms several established benchmark approaches. Additionally, we tested our model on a collected forest fire dataset, yielding promising results. Our research holds significant implications for forest protection and the mitigation of forest fire disasters."

    "abstract": "The efficiency of courts and prosecutors offices is crucial to ensure the protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms and to fulfil their social responsibilities. Increasing workloads within judicial systems, combined with excessive times to process cases and limited human resources, pose significant challenges in dealing with delays and backlogs. Quantitative data, such as case backlogs, the duration of proceedings, and the number of incoming and pending cases, could be exploited for Artificial Intelligence tools to forecast workloads and improve the performance of judicial systems, although their adoption still remains limited. This paper explores the application of five popular Machine Learning regression models-linear regression, decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient enhancement, and categorical enhancement-to predict the time (measured in days) required to process a number of civil cases. The performance of these models is evaluated using standard metrics. The main goal is to assess the potential of Artificial Intelligence tools in the judicial domain, contributing to the development of more efficient management strategies for the future. The Italian case study is particularly challenging because the performance of its judicial system is below the European average. For this reason, a case study from the Italian civil judicial sector is presented."

The FMMF approach produces a bio-integrity key used in a revised AES-GCM-IV scheme that greatly increases protection of data on the cloud. The performance is tested using False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), encryption time and decryption time. FMMF-based authentication achieved a much better average FAR of 0.15 and a much lower FRR of 2.1, surpassing all the single modalities. FMMF files performed encryption and decryption in 28 ms and 31 respectively.

Electric circuits are fundamental to electrical engineering, yet many students hold misconceptions that impede learning. Existing concept inventories often fail to distinguish between students with no prior knowledge and those who possess incorrect but confident beliefs. This study introduces the ECCD, which includes 30 items assessing key electric circuit concepts such as Voltage/Potential Difference, Current/Charge, Complete Circuit, and RLC components. The test comprises three tiers: a multiple-choice content knowledge tier (Tier 1), an open-ended reasoning tier (Tier 2), and a multiplechoice confidence level tier (Tier 3). Data from 254 undergraduate engineering students who participated in the pilot test were analyzed. This paper reports preliminary findings from Tier 1 (content knowledge) and Tier 2 (confidence levels), revealing prevalent misconceptions, particularly in Voltage/Potential Difference and Current/Charge, with a notable proportion of students demonstrating high confidence in incorrect responses. The next phase of this research will include analysis of Tier 3 (reasoning) responses and more comprehensive statistical analyses to refine the diagnostic tool and further explore misconceptions in electric circuit concepts."

    "abstract": "As with technical innovations, public skepticism often follows, especially when the innovation directly impacts their everyday lives. For instance, Electric Vehicles (EVs) face criticism due to the perceived risks from the addition of LithiumIon Batteries (LIBs), which can partake in Thermal Runaway Propagation (TRP) and fires. During thermal runaway events, extreme heating and the release of toxic gases such as hydrogen $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\right)$, carbon dioxide $\\left(\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\right)$, carbon monoxide (CO), methane $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{4}\\right)$, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and others occurs. Among these, Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC) - a component of LIB electrolyte having a significant mole fraction percentage relative to other gases expelled during TR - was chosen as the target substance for the sensor to detect. In the process of determining the ideal sensor for testing, it is important to consider both the evaporating temperatures of DMC and the sensor’s ability to perform in a realistic environment. We introduce a resistive gas sensor for low-temperature, early detection of electrolyte leakage of Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs). The sensor is synthesized from tin oxide (SnO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) deposited onto interdigitated gold (Au) electrodes. SnO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> offers a strong sensitivity towards target gases and CNT possesses the quality of reducing operating temperatures of metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors.

Invasive sensory and microbiological assessments are subjective and are time-intensive. The current study proposes a fuzzy logic technique utilizing the data derived using an electronic nose (e-nose) that has volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors in order to predict the freshness of coconut milk. Four gas sensors (MQ2, MQ5, MQ6, and MG135) were used to develop a Mamdani-type Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) in MATLAB that represent complex and non-linear nature of the relationship between concentrations of gases and level of spoilage. This system uses expert-based rules and customized membership functions to determine the freshness into three groups (Fresh, Medium, and Poor). In comparison to expert sensory results, the fuzzy logic model provided an 88% overall classification accuracy showing results capable of dealing with uncertainty in actual food data. Compared to others machine learning model, the proposed system is fully transparent, allowing it to be interpreted and deployed in food monitoring systems. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using fuzzy logic, based in simple computation, as an independent mechanism of intelligent food quality evaluation, which may be the solid basis of real-time, portable food freshness measurement devices in the food sector."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is vital for applications such as urban planning and disaster monitoring. However, the high cost of pixel-level annotations often results in limited labeled data, necessitating weakly supervised learning approaches. Unlike natural images, remote sensing images typically contain numerous small objects with substantial intra-class variations and high inter-class similarities, which poses challenges for generating high-quality pseudo label. Additionally, while Vision Transformer (ViT) have been integrated into Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for their global modeling capabilities, they are prone to over-smoothing in dense scenes, which impedes model learning. To address these challenges, we propose two novel modules: the Adaptive Token Linking Module (Adalink) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM)-Guided Boundary Refiner module(SGBR). First, Adalink employs a dynamic aggregation mechanism to analyze semantic diversity across the middle layer of ViT, adaptively selecting feature layer and constructing token correlation graphs. It leverages a self-supervised encoder to extract hierarchical token relationships, which to supervise pseudo label generation, thereby reducing erroneous activations in cluttered scenes and improving pseudo label quality. Second, SGBR utilizes the zero-shot segmentation capability of the SAM to refine segmentation results by incorporating object and boundary priors from the output images, significantly enhancing the completeness of small object segmentation and overall accuracy. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Potsdam, ISPRS Vaihingen, and iSAID datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits strong practical value in processing complex remote sensing scenes.

    "abstract": "This full research paper examines how a short 1.5-hour microelectronics workshop can influence students' experiential identity, interest, and self-efficacy in microelectronics, with a focus on gender composition in classroom settings. The microelectronics industry is critical to modern technologies, and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 underscores the need for a diverse domestic workforce. However, women remain underrepresented in STEM fields, which may affect their educational experiences and long-term career persistence. Using a quasiexperimental design, this study explored two research questions: [RQ1] Can a short 1.5-hour microelectronics workshop influence participants' Experiential Identity, Interest, and Self-Efficacy in microelectronics? [RQ1.1] Is this influence differential for women and men? [RQ2] Does classroom composition affect the influence of the workshop on women's Experiential Identity, Interest, and Self-Efficacy in microelectronics? Thirty-three undergraduate students were randomly assigned to classrooms with varying gender composition. Results indicated overall improvements in experiential identity, interest, and self-efficacy, with the most significant gains among participants in classrooms with adequate female representation. In the Women-Represented (WR) classroom, women showed the largest increases in experiential identity (82.35%) and self-efficacy (50%), with a smaller positive change in interest <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(0.0089 \\%)$</tex>. In the Mixed-Male-Represented (MMR) classroom, gains were more modest and there was no change in interest, suggesting peer composition matters. These findings align with Social Cognitive Career Theory, highlighting the importance of successful learning experiences in fostering self-efficacy and interest. The study demonstrates the value of short-term interventions and the role of gender composition in shaping equitable outcomes in microelectronics education."

The study focuses on two upper-division computer architecture courses and explores how large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT-4o, can be scaffolded to support student learning. Our approach emphasizes guided AI interaction rather than direct answer generation. It is grounded in Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development and implemented through the ADDIE instructional design model. Two scaffolding protocols—AI Think-Aloud and AI-Driven Pair Programming—are proposed, that foster metacognitive engagement and collaborative problem-solving. The paper highlights the need for differentiated instruction aligned with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to assist individuals who lack skills necessary to take advantage of LLMs. Preliminary findings suggest that structured AI integration can enhance learning outcomes and engagement, while minimizing risks associated with unregulated AI use. Evaluation methods include SOLO taxonomy analysis of student-AI interactions and short-term longitudinal survey data on student attitudes. The work contributes to emerging frameworks for ethical, inclusive, and pedagogically grounded AI adoption in engineering classrooms."

    "abstract": "The special structure of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses challenges to the integrated design method and power transmission capability of the couplers used for their wireless charging. This paper proposes a new inductive and capacitive combined hybrid wireless power transfer coupler for UAV. Among them, the capacitive coupler is designed as a six-plate structure. A receiving plate and a shielding plate are installed on each of the two landing gears of the UAV, and the transmitting plates are installed on the ground. The FR4 epoxy insulating material is filled between the plates to increase the coupling capacitance. The inductive coupler adopts a square coil form, which is installed on the belly of the UAV. Inductive coupler and capacitive coupler compensate each other for reactive power while transmitting power, which eliminates the need for additional compensation network components on the receiving side. Secondly, based on the single-sided LCLC compensation network, this paper presents a parameter design method that can adjust the power transmission ratio of inductive and capacitive couplers. Then, the component stress analysis was conducted. Compared with the inductive power transfer (IPT) and capacitive power transfer (CPT) systems that have the same coupler and similar compensation network, the proposed system significantly reduced the stress on the coupler. Finally, an experimental prototype is established to verify the scheme. The experimental results show that the system can transmit 500W at an efficiency of 80.7%, which means it can be used for wireless charging of UAV."

    "abstract": "The emotional video captioning (EVC) task, which aims to generate factual descriptions based on the perceived subtle visual emotion cues, has received more and more attention and research. However, EVC is essentially an objective video captioning task, and ignores the subjective emotional reactions of video viewers, which cannot reflect personalized affective understandings of different viewers on the same video. To fill the research gap, we investigate the subjective video captioning (SVC) task in this paper, which aims to generate emotional captions by incorporating viewers’ personalized emotional reactions upon the EVC task. SVC is extremely challenging, which lies in two aspects: 1) the correlative emotion perception between subjective and objective emotions; and 2) the collaborative generation between emotional and factual information. To this end, we propose the Subjective-Objective Emotion-Correlated Generation Network (SO-ECGN) in this paper. Specifically, our SO-ECGN leverages the proposed dynamic mask attention and emotion domain shifting module to achieve the objective emotion incremental learning, and then, a subjective-objective emotions correlation module is proposed to adaptively combine two perspective emotions to provide accurate emotion guidance (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, emotional polarity and intensity) for each generation step.

To explore how disciplines support these students, we conducted a scoping literature review of 386 papers, narrowing to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n=29$</tex> based on inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified three dominant framings of accessibility: (1) Technical Accessibility, emphasizing learning technologies and assistive tools; (2) Physical and Sensory Accessibility, focusing on inclusive design in spaces and labs; and (3) Pedagogical Accessibility, highlighting inclusive instructional strategies. While all three fields recognize the importance of accessibility, computing and Engineering tend to prioritize technical solutions, whereas Physics often emphasizes physical access and curricular changes. These disciplinary differences suggest that accessibility efforts are shaped more by fieldspecific demands than by a unified framework. By understanding how accessibility and accommodations are conceptualized across disciplines, educator and institution can adopt targeted strategies to support students with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning environment in STEM."

    "abstract": "Continuous object tracking in IoT-enabled Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) requires fast, energy-efficient boundary detection, especially for dynamic phenomena such as toxic gas leakage or wildfire spread. However, existing approaches often rely on cloud-centric processing, resulting in high transmission delays and excessive energy consumption due to large-scale node activation. This paper proposes Boundary Detection of Continuous Objects (BDCO), a fog-assisted scheme that reduces communication overhead and improves boundary accuracy. BDCO organizes the network into grid-based clusters where the Cluster Head (CH) filters anomalous data using a selective aggregation mechanism and forwards only relevant boundary-related information to the fog node (FN). The FN then applies a convex-hull-based boundary estimation model, enabling precise boundary formulation while minimizing node activation. The proposed scheme is implemented in NS-2.35 and demonstrates substantial improvements in energy consumption (3.00E+06), service delay (22 ms), end-to-end delay (33 ms), packet loss ratio (3.0), and boundary accuracy (0.85) compared to existing approaches. Overall, the BDCO scheme provides a more energy-efficient and delay-aware solution for real-time boundary detection of continuous objects in an IoT-enabled WSN environment."

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) provides a compelling solution for applying RL in high-risk or resourceconstrained real-world domains such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and robotic manipulation, where online exploration can be unsafe or impractical. However, Offline RL faces critical challenges arising from limited data coverage and potential distributional mismatch between the pre-training dataset and real-world environment. In this paper, we propose to allow an agent to learn from a hybrid dataset: high-quality real-world data and high-diversity simulation data, and assume that the dynamics of the simulation and the real world do not match, but the state space is the same. To address the policy extrapolation error and potentially catastrophic failures because of out-of-distribution actions and sim-to-real gap, we use progressive neural networks (PNNs) to transfer the offline policy to the real world. Results in two robotic manipulation tasks with a six-degree-of-freedom Ned robotic arm show that, the hybrid dataset facilitates faster offline learning and better adaptation to real-world tasks during online learning. In addition, further analysis shows that transferring the offline policy via PNN can not only effectively retain the policy learned from the hybrid dataset and bridge the gap between simulation and reality data, but also allow the agent to explore in a more diverse distribution of samples during online learning."

To address this limitation, this study integrates a Retinex-based adaptive illumination enhancement module into the preprocessing stage of the YOLOv11 detection framework. The proposed method improves the visibility of weld seams and defect textures by restoring illumination balance and preserving structural details. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in detection performance, with increased precision, recall, and mAP metrics compared to the baseline model. Quantitative evaluations using PSNR and SSIM further confirm the superiority of the proposed enhancement technique over classical methods such as Gamma, LIME, and Retinex SSR. Although the approach effectively enhances performance under challenging lighting conditions, real-time efficiency and robustness in uncontrolled industrial environments remain open issues. Future work will focus on optimizing high-capacity YOLO architectures through Knowledge Distillation (KD) to develop lightweight student models capable of achieving high accuracy with reduced computational cost, enabling practical deployment in real-world welding inspection systems"

Using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, 45 scientific publications were systematically analyzed to uncover the contribution of these technologies to the efficiency, accuracy, and responsiveness of public policy. The study results indicate that the integration of these three technologies has the potential to form a predictive and prescriptive decision support system, enabling local governments to formulate evidence-based policies, conduct policy simulations, and predict the long-term impacts of policies. However, the implementation of these technologies still faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of data interoperability, infrastructure readiness, and limited human resource capacity for advanced analysis. Therefore, improving cross-sector data integration, developing human resource capacity, and strengthening technological infrastructure are key to optimizing the benefits of these technologies for local governance."

This study analyzes public responses to the government’s Free Health Check-Up Program using data extracted from tweets on Platform X posted between October 20, 2024 and March 31, 2025. The study employs a multi-task classification approach in which the first task classifies tweets as either news or public service announcements, while the second task performs sentiment analysis. For comparison, single-task and multi-class classification model were also developed as baselines, allowing a comprehensive evaluation across different strategies. The dataset was preprocessed using a combination of the NLTK method, custom-built dictionary, and the InSet Lexicon-Based method for automatic sentiment labeling. The classification model used was IndoBERT, which is a BERT-based model and was optimized using the Design of Experiment technique. The multi-task classification approach demonstrated optimal performance. Achieving Content type classification reached an accuracy of 87.05% and F1-score of 84.04%, while sentiment classification achieved an even higher accuracy of 89.76% and F1-score of 87.07%. The model was trained with dropout rate of 0.2, learning rate of 5e-5, batch size of 32, weight decay of 0.1, and 5 training epochs. These result demonstrate the potential of multi-task classification and the IndoBERT model for analyzing public sentiment on social media platforms."

As a result, they cannot easily revisit specimens or reproduce classroom observations. Moreover, key teacher instructions are often delivered verbally and not fully recorded in teaching materials, forcing students to rely on time-consuming video reviews. Existing teaching systems typically rely on static images, lacking interactivity and platform integration, and are insufficient to meet learning needs. To solve the above problems, this study designs an AI-assisted teaching system that combines large language model and retrieval-augmented generation technology. The system consists of modules such as textbook uploading, segmentation indexing, search generation and interactive interface. It supports users to upload classroom text books and quickly obtain review texts and reference materials through prompts, thereby improving data availability and learning efficiency. In addition, the system is also planned to support images and multimodal data in the future, and will introduce learning effectiveness assessment and multi-platform authentication mechanisms. The initial construction has been completed, and it is planned to conduct small-scale closed testing in actual courses to collect feedback to optimize system functions and verify application potential."

    "abstract": "Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers are widely used for prototyping and small-scale production; however, they require continuous supervision to prevent defects, which can lead to materials and time wastage. Excessive vibrations during the printing process often cause such defects. Therefore, it is essential to develop a vibration monitoring mechanism. Although prior research studies have focused on employing vibration data and machine learning to detect problems such as nozzle clogging and filament jams, little research attention has been given to real-time, automatic corrective measures. This study focuses on developing an economical, autonomous defect detection system based on accelerometer data. The system monitors vibration patterns in real-time and applies the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency domain data. Upon detection of defects, the system, which, implemented using Python, automatically pauses or stops the printer. The defect identification accuracy is enhanced using Cosine Similarity, which compares real-time data with the normal state of the printer. Experimental results indicate that the system can effectively detect changes in vibration patterns, such as those caused by loose belts, and implement immediate corrective actions. This autonomous approach significantly reduces material waste and improves the overall reliability of the 3D printing process. This research study contributes to the field by integrating defect detection with real-time interventions, providing a practical solution for improving the efficiency of FDM printing."

Despite extensive research, unified comparisons of runtime, memory consumption, and solution reliability across paradigms remain limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of four algorithms—Depth-First Search (DFS), Hill-Climbing (HC), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Genetic Algorithms (GA)—implemented within a common Python framework. Each solver was tested on board sizes N ∈ {10,30,50,100,200} over 100 independent trials under standardized conditions, measuring runtime, peak memory, and success probability. Results show that DFS achieved 100% success for N =10 but failed beyond N =30 due to exponential scaling. HC delivered 100% success up to N =50 but degraded to 50% success at N =200. SA maintained 88–100% success across all scales with moderate runtime (0.05–3.5 s) and memory usage (6–11 MB). GA achieved universal 100% success but required higher computational resources (0.1–10 s, 12–40 MB). These findings reveal practical trade-offs: exact methods for small instances, HC for rapid mid-scale solutions, SA for balanced performance, and GA for maximum reliability. The results provide actionable guidelines for selecting algorithms in resource-constrained optimization contexts."

    "abstract": "Fault detection in rocket engines is of prime importance for mission reliability, crew safety, and maintaining the structural longevity of propulsion systems. Traditional methods of engine diagnosis often involve threshold-based monitoring, hardware redundancy, and human visual inspection, which may only be able to catch faults well after they have grown severe, leaving little time for effective intervention. Modern rocket engines incorporate increasingly sophisticated component assemblies and sensing arrays, which are generating large volumes of dynamic telemetry that traditional systems cannot parse effectively. With advances in AI, ML, and DL, today's aerospace engineers have access to powerful analytics that can much more precisely detect subtle deviations from nominal operation. The paper proposes a theoretical design for an AI-based rocket engine fault detection architecture based on recent literature related to anomaly detection, temporal neural networks, autoencoders, and physics-informed learning. It integrates multi-sensor telemetry, signal preprocessing, LSTM-based temporal modelling, autoencoder-based unsupervised anomaly detection, and physics-informed neural network checks within an ensemble decision framework with human-in-the-loop verification. Sources for verified figures are listed next to each placeholder. The design illustrates how hybrid physics-AI systems can detect combustion instability, turbopump degradation, and injector anomalies with better early warning and reliability compared to traditional threshold-based approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the design problem of periodic event-triggered quantized control (PETQC) for general nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) with multiple communication channels between the plant and the controller. The transmission of information over these channels is asynchronous, and the transmission instants are determined by a local dynamic event-triggering mechanism (ETM). In each channel, continuous signals are sampled and quantized with a dynamic quantizer (DQ) before being transmitted due to limited bandwidth. In addition, large transmission delays may occur, packets may be lost and even without acknowledgements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce auxiliary variables and design appropriate jump rules to monitor the changing process of the total network-induced errors. Meanwhile, we propose new design conditions for ETM and DQs, and develop an encoding rule and a decoding algorithm. Then, we construct a new Lyapunov function and design a PETQC strategy to ensure the input-to-state stability of the nonlinear NCSs. Next, we construct triggering functions and dynamic variables for the event trigger in each channel. Compared with the existing literature, the proposed design conditions for periodic ETM involve fewer constraints and are less conservative. Finally, the efficiency and less conservatism of the theoretical results are illustrated by simulation studies."

To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that synergizes PPO with gradient-free evolutionary algorithms, unlocking unprecedented exploration potential in high-dimensional policy spaces. By integrating the global search ability of evolutionary algorithms, our approach not only preserves PPO’s stability and monotonic improvement guarantees but also empowers it to escape local optima and discover significantly superior policies. Extensive experiments across diverse and complex environments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showcasing performance improvements over standard PPO. This work bridges the gap between gradient-based and gradient-free optimization paradigms, offering a robust solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning."

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions in infants. However, conventional radiofrequency (RF) hardware is often ill-suited for pediatric applications due to its size, rigidity, and potential safety concerns. In this study, we present the design and numerical evaluation of a subwavelength RF resonator tailored specifically for infant brain imaging at 1.5 T. The proposed resonator comprises four radially oriented split-loop resonators (SLRs) that locally enhance the RF magnetic field of the birdcage body coil without requiring direct connections to the MRI scanner or active electronics. Electromagnetic simulations were conducted using both homogeneous and voxel-based models of infants. The resonator demonstrated a 5.5-fold increase in transmit efficiency of the body coil in the phantom model and a 5.8-fold increase in the voxelized model. A gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2.98 was observed compared to the body coil alone, along with a 1.46-fold improvement over a conventional local receive-only head coil. Furthermore, the application of the proposed resonator reduced the required input power and local maximum specific absorption rate (SAR), improving the SAR efficiency (or RF safety) metric from 2.75 to 4.35 μT√kg/W. These findings highlight the potential of wireless resonant devices to enhance both performance and safety in neonatal MRI without requiring modifications to scanner hardware or software."

For this reason, we present an artificial intelligence-enhanced recommended systems that incorporates multi-preference deep teaching techniques to increase the quality of recommendations and the level of pleasure experienced by users. Adaptive modelling of user-item exchanges is accomplished via the use of Graphical Neural Network (GNNs) and Transformer-based structures in the method that has been developed. A system for optimisation that is founded on reinforced training constantly improves suggestions by analysing input from users. Furthermore, the combination of several preferences enables the program to take into effect environmental variables, such as the record of perusing, the habits of purchases, and the aspects that are related to time. The presented model surpasses current prescription algorithms in regards of accuracy, recall, and F1-scoring as shown by numerous trials conducted on datasets taken from the actual universe. By more effectively adjusting to users' ever-changing tastes, the software can accomplish a 20% increase in the precision of its recommendations and to increase user involvement. When contrasted to traditional approaches, our methodology provides suggestions that are 90% more personalised, flexible, and adaptable. As a result, it is an excellent option for recommended engines of the future generations."

Edge computing, a paradigm shift introduced in 2016, extends cloud computing by processing data closer to the end-users at the network's edge. Despite its recognition as a burgeoning industry trend and its widespread application, a structured educational pathway to impart the requisite knowledge and skills in edge computing to students remains elusive. This paper outlines the development of a curriculum tailored for an entry-level edge computing course, emphasizing project-based learning (PBL) as its core pedagogical strategy. It delves into the formulation of learning objectives, selection of pertinent topics, identification of unique instructional challenges, and the integration of PBL to fulfill the educational aims effectively. The narrative progresses to reflect on the teaching experiences and modifications made across three consecutive offerings of the course in 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Despite maintaining a consistent topic coverage and PBL methodology, each iteration introduced novel elements to the PBL design: the first focused on a student design competition, the second incorporated a survey option for online participants, and the third expanded to include an application track to accommodate a larger class size. By analyzing the students' evaluation and comments, we evaluate the course's impact on student engagement and learning. Furthermore, the paper makes a significant contribution to the academic community by offering all course materials, including the syllabus, lecture notes, programming assignments, and the PBL framework, for public access and reuse."

For this study, DeWaters and Powers's framework was utilized that consists of cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions. Our results will focus on how these interdisciplinary students show differences in understanding of energy concepts, their behavior and actions towards energy related issues. By using qualitative and thematic coding, the analysis helps in providing broad-level insights into how interdisciplinary students understand energy concepts and this highlights the importance of developing more effective and inclusive energy education methods. These results of different understandings of energy concepts provide insights that can help teachers in developing curriculum which integrates basic knowledge with student engagement emotionally and behavior."

    "abstract": "An online variational Bayesian algorithm based on a skewed Student's <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>-distribution, referred to as OVB-skewt, is proposed for robust parameter estimation in linear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX) models. In practical applications, measurement data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed, and asymmetric noise, which poses significant challenges to conventional identification methods that typically assume Gaussian noise. To address this issue, the proposed method incorporates the generalized hyperbolic skewed Student's <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>-distribution into a variational Bayesian inference framework, allowing the noise characteristics to be adaptively learned during online estimation. By explicitly modeling both heavy-tailed behavior and skewness, the proposed algorithm improves robustness against outliers and asymmetric disturbances. The online formulation enables efficient processing of streaming data, making the method suitable for time-varying industrial environments. Numerical simulations and a continuous fermentation reactor (CFR) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed OVB-skewt approach achieves improved estimation accuracy compared with symmetric noise-based methods under skewed and contaminated noise conditions, while maintaining stable performance in online settings."

    "abstract": "This research presents an improved Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) using Sugeno Fuzzy Logic for enhanced mobile robot collision avoidance in dynamic environments. Standard DWA algorithms utilize fixed weight parameters that limit their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, particularly in scenarios with moving obstacles. To address these limitations, this study develops a Fuzzy Dynamic Window Approach (FDWA) that integrates Sugeno fuzzy logic with DWA to enable adaptive weight adjustment based on real-time environmental feedback. The research methodology involves implementing and comparing three navigation algorithms: standard DWA, improved DWA, and FDWA with fuzzy weight adjustment. All algorithms were tested in simulated environments featuring both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that FDWA significantly outperforms both standard DWA and improved DWA in dynamic and complex environments with respect to navigation efficiency, speed, and collision rate."

    "abstract": "Accurate delineation of multiple sclerosis lesions in brain MRI remains difficult due to small and diffuse pathology and inter rater variability. Spatial attention models often pool over space which erodes voxel level detail and increases complexity. We introduce ConvSE module which integrates a convolution based squeeze and excitation module within a fully convolutional DenseNet for lesion segmentation. The module forms a channel descriptor by global average pooling. A two layer bottleneck with a reduction ratio predicts channel gates. The gates rescale feature responses at full resolution and the network is trained with a Dice loss and a cross entropy loss. We evaluate on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal resource using patient wise five fold cross validation on FLAIR MRI with identical preprocessing and splits to a strong attention baseline. ConvSE improves cross fold mean Dice from 0.781 to 0.811. It reaches a best fold Dice of 0.875 and a fold mean of 0.847. It reduces parameters from 13501982 to 5148386 and shortens training time while maintaining specificity near 0.999. The results show sharper boundaries and fewer false positives than the existing attention models."

Conventional threshold-based HO mechanisms lack adaptability to dynamic radio conditions, leading to suboptimal decisions and ping-pong effects. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based HO decision framework trained and evaluated on real-world LTE drive-test datasets from a dense urban environment in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The HO problem is modeled as a contextual bandit and solved using tabular Q-learning with a binary action space. The reward function integrates handover margin (HOM) and time-to-trigger (TTT) constraints to promote link stability and penalize unstable HOs. Evaluation on unseen traces uses nearest-neighbour state matching, while an external TTT filter further improves temporal stability. Results show consistent suppression of unnecessary HOs and alignment with reward objectives, confirming the framework’s robustness and adaptability for practical LTE deployments."

    "abstract": "This Work-in-Progress paper, submitted under the Engineering Ethics and Innovative Practice track, explores an experiential approach to ethics education for upper-level undergraduates in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) and Art History. As generative artificial intelligence (AI)-including large language models and image-generation tools-becomes more accessible, the ability to create compelling but synthetic visual media has increased dramatically. This raises urgent ethical questions regarding authenticity, authorship, and the risk of deception, particularly in the context of so-called “deepfakes.” The 2023 ENISA Threat Landscape Report identified deepfakes as a critical threat to digital trust and public security. In response, this study examines how students from divergent academic disciplines evaluate the authenticity of visual artworks. Participants engage in Real or Fake, an interactive multimedia game in which they assess 28 images to determine whether each was created by a human artist or by AI. A point-based scoring system records performance, and comparative analysis is conducted to examine differences in decision-making strategies. The game integrates concepts of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and Visual Quotient Reasoning (VQR) to evaluate participants' ability to detect stylistic, contextual, and semantic anomalies. Preliminary results show that art history students outperform engineering students on average, suggesting that disciplinary training in visual analysis influences discernment ability. These findings highlight the value of integrating ethical reflection, AI literacy, and interpretive skills across technical and humanities curricula. The study contributes to the growing need for interdisciplinary pedagogy that equips students to critically engage with the implications of AI-generated media."

While machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated high accuracy in phishing detection, their real-world adoption is hindered by limited interpretability, reduced user trust, and vulnerability to adversarial manipulation. This work presents a modular, applied framework that combines a Decision Tree-based detection engine with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques—SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)—and an adversarial robustness module inspired by the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack methodology. Unlike the original PGD, which is designed for continuous feature spaces, our adaptation applies controlled, bounded perturbations to phishing URL features, simulating realistic evasion tactics while preserving URL validity. This ensures the framework can assess and improve model resilience in practical threat scenarios. We evaluate the system using the Kaggle Phishing URLs dataset, achieving a baseline accuracy of 96% and 90% accuracy under PGD-inspired adversarial perturbations. Qualitative SHAP and LIME visualizations illustrate the model’s decision logic, enhancing transparency and user trust. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, transparent, and resilient phishing detection solution suitable for enterprise-grade deployment."

Traditional approaches to perform this, including in vitro experiments, face challenges such as costly resources and limited dataset. Hence, ML solutions are developed to mitigate these challenges with each research having their own distinct methodologies and results. This study replicates a past research's ([5]) methodology and dataset to see if additional data preprocessing steps (e.g., data cleaning) and non-linear classification models improve previous results and output feature importance information. This study's methodology involved training and validating three models: Extra Trees, XGBoost, and a novel hybrid model called NCART. The training data consists of 1 350 compounds for isoform II, IX, and XII, curated from ChEMBL database and described with RDKit feature set library. The experiments show that Extra Trees have the best performance measured with Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) and accuracy, but both NCART and XGBoost show competitive performance in comparison with the added benefit of interpretability. Both of these models identified van der Waals surface area (VSA), the number of rings, molecular weight, topological polar surface area (TPSA), and negative charges as the most influential features for determining a compound's activity. These findings are consistent with established drug design principles and existing patterns of clinically approved hCA inhibitor drugs, which provide insights for the rational design of new hCA inhibitors."

This approach can address the decades-old challenge of convincing CS majors to take continuous mathematics seriously while also exposing CS majors early to new topics in machine learning and data science. This paper discusses a proof-of-concept course implementation whose preliminary evaluation led to the refining of assessment instruments and fine-tuning of research questions. It also outlines plans for expanding this approach to topics in probability and linear algebra."

As part of a required design course, students collaborate on both short- and long-term projects throughout the semester. Teams meet twice weekly during class and are expected to coordinate outside of class to complete assignments. To assess team functioning, a peer evaluation instrument is administered midway through the semester. The instrument includes both quantitative and qualitative components. The quantitative section is based on a validated four-factor team effectiveness model—interdependency, goal setting, potency, and trust—each measured using three Likert-scale items. Students evaluate both teammates and themselves on all items. Additionally, students allocate a total of 100 points across team members to represent their perception of each member's contribution. The standard deviation of these peer-assigned grades is used to categorize teams by potential dysfunction. Following the quantitative section, students provide open-ended comments describing observed positive and negative teamwork behaviors. This study explores the degree of discrepancy between self- and peer evaluations, particularly in teams with high grade variance. We also investigate whether teams with higher standard deviations in peer grades exhibit distinct patterns of negative behavior in their qualitative feedback. These findings aim to improve early identification of dysfunctional team dynamics and inform targeted instructional interventions in engineering education."

The Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 (DFUC2022) was organized to encourage interest and development of dedicated segmentation models for this task. In this paper, we present a workflow that yielded a strong performance on the DFUC leaderboard. We analyze the impact of various model ensembling strategies for improving their performance. Efficient training routine was used to train off-the-shelf SegFormer transformers. Scaling of SegFormer models led to an F1 score of 0.733 and $6^{\\text {th }}$ rank on the leaderboard using the MiT-B5 backbone. The ensemble developed during this analysis resulted in a model that achieved 0.7363 F1 score and a $3^{\\text {rd }}$ rank on the leaderboard using three MiT-B5 networks."

The research targets twelve participants, with preliminary findings based on the first set of interviews presented in this running paper. Data collection methods include semi-structured individual interviews. The research is guided by the ECIT framework using NVivo to uncover key factors shaping faculty experiences and aspirations regarding microlearning adoption. Preliminary findings reveal three major enablers: flexible content delivery, immediate feedback, and positive student reception. The most frequently cited barriers include difficulty simplifying complex technical content, limitations of institutional tools, and a lack of professional development focused on microlearning. Wishlist items include access to gamified and interactive tools, AI-driven personalization features, and greater institutional training and support. This study helps to bridge a critical gap by capturing the lived experiences of faculty members using ECIT. By surfacing helping factors, barriers, and aspirational needs surrounding microlearning, it offers early insights into the practical realities of microlearning adoption.

These features are fed to a lightweight Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit, with attention pooling that focuses on clinically salient segments. Using speaker-independent 10-fold cross-validation on each dataset and a speaker-held-out test set for final evaluation, this study explores both overall and task-wise performance on two languages, Italian and Spanish. On Italian speech, HuBERT attains 97.9% accuracy with AUC = 99.0, approaching screening quality, while on PC-GITA, WavLM generalizes best with 88.4% accuracy and AUC = 95.8, underscoring the role of language/domain in backbone choice. Task-wise analysis shows Reading/Sentences are the most reliable, high-yield probes, with DDK also robust; Vowels/Monologue are more variable and serve as complementary evidence.

This paper's focus is on fraud detection through backlogging, wherein transaction records are continuously recorded and stored, analyzed, and used whenever suspicious activity is identified. The system analyses unusual characteristics and abnormal transaction frequency, purchase pattern, geolocation anomaly, device fingerprinting, and payment methods. On the fraud detection front, non-machine learning methods such as rules-based filtering present the front lines of defense (for example, flagging transactions of unusually high values or repeated failed attempt). At the same time, machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Network are all trained on the backlog data to label transactions as genuine or fraudulent. By combining real-time monitoring with historical checking, this framework can detect fraudulent activities early while keeping false positives at a minimum. Experimental results show that this hybrid approach leads to improved detection accuracy, enhanced consumer trust, and scalable."

This paper presents a new hybrid model of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) that provides a high level of assurance in the edge-IoT ecosystems. The model being proposed combines lattice-based methods, i.e., Kyber-786 and Dilithium-III, and an AES-GCM layer model. Moreover, a trust and key negotiation mathematical analysis brings to fore the resistance of classical and quantum attackers with module-LWE and ring-LWE assumptions. The Python-based simulation proves that the suggested method increases the throughput by 18.6% and reduces the latency by 22.4% in comparison to the conventional methods. Also, there is a reduction of energy consumption by 41.7% with the use of a hybrid design caused by the hardware-accelerated two-polynomial operations and an optimized offloading. The analysis has shown that the proposed solution satisfies the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity with less than 7.3 ms overhead per transaction, and PQC can be used in IoT and consumer settings without compromising responsiveness and energy consumption."

In this survey, we consider an energy conversion chain incorporating energy sources, converters, controllers, sensors, and loads as a complex or a large system with several subsystems by integrating the AI part for several objectives among others: design, control, optimization, maintenance, fault detection, etc. Our unique contributions include: first, a complete lifecycle-oriented perspective for power electronics systems, second, structured tabular summaries emphasizing experimental validation versus simulation-only studies, third, focus on design automation and AI-integrated converter control, and fourth, identification of research gaps in hardware implementation and model interpretability. This survey also identifies open challenges and offers forward-looking insights into design automation, and AI-integrated converter control for smart grids, electric vehicles, and power systems. This article aims to serve as a roadmap for both researchers and engineers seeking to adopt AI in next-generation power electronics. Part II of this survey will focus on the maintenance and forecasting phases of the lifecycle of PES."

    "abstract": "Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) struggle to detect evolving cyber threats—specially form zeroday attacks, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) etc. Which are vulnerable to disruptions from manual or automated interventions that compromise their operational integrity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-evolving framework integrating Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with bio-inspired algorithms—including synaptic plasticity, homeostatic regulation, and adaptive learning mechanisms—to enable autonomous self-detection, validation, and correction of IDS/IPS functionality. The system's architecture features a multi-layered neural processing core combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for pattern recognition with neuroplasticity-inspired mechanisms that enable continuous learning from network traffic patterns. This design allows real-time detection of both known and unknown attacks, delivering improved accuracy and reduced false positive rates versus conventional approaches. Bio-inspired adaptation mechanisms further enhance resilience against dynamic threats, empowering the system to evolve alongside emerging cyber risks. Critically, the framework includes granular observation and response capabilities to manage deliberate human interventions or automatic interruptions. In such scenarios, it deploys partial or permanent corrective measures that prioritize maintaining uninterrupted IDS/IPS functionality, minimizing disruption to security operations. By merging deep learning with biological-inspired adaptability, our approach provides a robust, selfsustaining solution for modern cybersecurity challenges."

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context (PICOC) framework, we searched Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect for English, peer-reviewed studies (2020–2025). 256 records were collected, 74 duplicates were removed and 182 titles/abstracts were screened; 17 met preliminary criteria, and 11 were included after full-text assessment using a critical appraisal rubric. Most studies used YOLO-family, one-stage detectors; alternatives (e.g., MCNN, Mask R-CNN, VGG-based pipelines) were less common. Reported accuracies are promising, but heterogeneous datasets and metrics—varying IoU thresholds and mixed use of mAP, F1, precision–recall—limit cross-study comparability and external validity. Recurrent deployment barriers include underwater variability (turbidity, lighting, occlusion), scarce public datasets for benchmarking, and limited evidence of generalization across species and farm conditions. Priorities include standardized datasets and reporting, head-to-head benchmarks of YOLO and non-YOLO models, evaluation under edgecompute constraints, and multi-site validations. Overall, vision-based pellet detection shows clear potential to reduce waste and enable feedback-controlled feeding, but broader adoption requires stronger evidence and standardization."

Our method captures subtle emotional cues and temporal inconsistencies that are frequently missing or distorted in manipulated videos by modeling long-range dependencies in facial sequences. The proposed TCN-based model performs significantly better than the traditional CNN, LSTM, and Transformer-based baselines, particularly in cross-dataset and adversarial scenarios, according to evaluations conducted on a curated dataset that combines real and synthetic content annotated with micro-expressions."

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells are a key biomarker in liquid biopsy, offering a noninvasive approach to monitor and guide therapeutic decision in cancer patients. The extreme rarity and the heterogeneity of CTCs make their identification extremely challenging. To overcome these limitations, CTC can be isolated exploiting an unbiased workflow based on Parsortix® strategy, which enriches for CTC according to their size and deformability, in combination with DEPArray ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ technology that allows visualization and selection of single CTC. Then, expert physicians manually analyze the digital images of cells acquired with DEPArray technology. The introduction of an automatic system for CTC identification into clinical workflows could facilitate the early detection of metastases, optimize treatment decision-making, and improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we present a Deep Learning-based classification pipeline to distinguish CTCs from leukocytes in a liquid biopsy, focusing on improving diagnostic procedure and accuracy. The proposed method automatically classifies images acquired with DEParray technology, obtained at “Fondazione IRCCS-Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori” of Milan. It is based on ResNet architecture, a Convolutional Neural Network for image analysis and very popular in the medical field. The introduction of a carefully designed augmentation process allows incrementing data variability, obtaining improving in the model performance. The proposed method achieves an F1 score of $0,777 \\pm 0,012$. The obtained promising results encourage us to do future research in this field."

    "abstract": "Effective network forensics analysis necessitates the capability to reproduce any network event, irrespective of the user’s motivation, the characteristics of earlier events, and whether the origin of the events was an unauthorized intruder or a legitimate user. Numerous packet analyzers, network monitoring systems, and intrusion detection tools today enable network measurement and analysis through packet capturing, which facilitates the examination and reconstruction of network events and user activities. However, they lack the ability to offer cryptographic proof for the packet flows that have been captured. Building on this motivation, we provide the initial steps toward the development of TC-NetTrack: a device that utilizes trusted computing to generate digital proof for specific packet flows captured either on a node’s network interface or across a network link. Since TC-NetTrack needs to produce evidence that holds probative value, the most suitable method to achieve this is through digital signatures. However, signing each packet individually is not practical or efficient; therefore, we adopted a method known as tree chaining. We implemented this using Merkle trees alongside an optimized algorithm for traversing the tree, which conserves both space and time when the signer generates packet flow evidence. We assessed the tree chaining technique on three different platforms, each featuring varying processors and memory capacities. TC-NetTrack could be beneficial in application scenarios or use cases that demand verification of the recorded packet flows, including stock trading, financial applications, attack analysis, or military operations."

However, most existing approaches heavily rely on basic item attributes while overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in multi-modal content. Moreover, they often fall short in effectively capturing the temporal evolution of user interests. To address these limitations, we are motivated to develop a novel sequential recommendation framework called Multimodal Temporal Graph Recommendation (MTGRec), which integrates multi-modal content fusion with temporal graph modeling. Specifically, the model leverages graph convolutional networks to capture local interaction patterns and employs Transformer-based architectures to learn the global evolution of user preferences over time. Experimental results on three realworld datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing model performance."

Hemiplegia often leads to gait impairment due to limited knee movement. Previous Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems for rehabilitation could not respond to real-time changes in subject conditions, and stimulation adjustment between antagonistic muscles was slow, causing unstable motion. This study proposes a closed-loop FES system integrating dual IMU sensors and a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) with a Fuzzy Coactivation Map to coordinate quadriceps and hamstring activity based on real-time knee trajectory feedback. The coactivation mapping functioned effectively in synchronizing muscle activation. However, the knee movement produced by the system was not yet smooth and accurate, indicating that the closedloop control still requires further improvement. Future work will focus on enhancing controller responsiveness and stability to achieve better motion performance in hemiplegic patients."

This study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based quantitative approach integrating surface electromyography (sEMG) and kinematic parameters for the classification of Brunnstrom recovery stages (BRS) II to V in PAC patients. Twenty post-stroke PAC patients and six healthy controls participated in the study. sEMG signals from the brachioradialis, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and deltoid muscles, alongside kinematic data (angle), were recorded during guide-assisted elbow extension. Feature extraction included the co-contraction index (CCI) and five time-domain parameters. After normalization, XGBoost classifiers were trained and optimized via Bayesian optimization. The model achieved high classification accuracy across all stages, with an average accuracy of 96.91% and an F1 score of 0.97. Feature importance analysis identified CCI as the most influential parameter. Furthermore, the CCI trend analysis revealed distinct fluctuation patterns corresponding to stroke severity and recovery phase in PAC patients. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-integrated multimodal analysis for objective, quantitative assessment of upper limb function in post-stroke PAC rehabilitation, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making and personalized intervention strategies."

Undergraduate research experiences are widely recognized in literature as critical for fostering interest and preparedness for advanced studies and professional careers in STEM. Graduate student mentorship is a vital component of these experiences, often described in the literature as part of a triadic relationship. However, most studies on undergraduate research experiences focus primarily on undergraduate outcomes, offering limited attention to the graduate student's role as a bridge between faculty PIs and undergraduate researchers. The purpose of this study is to explore the perception of undergraduate researchers on their engagement with graduate student mentors during a year-long research experience. Data analyzed for this study were collected through interviews conducted at the end of the program. Thematic analysis was employed to identify key themes and draw insights from participants' experiences. The findings reveal that graduate student mentors provided critical intellectual and practical guidance, fostered observational learning, and created collaborative environments that enhanced teamwork and belonging. Participants highlighted areas for improvement, including aligning expectations, roles, and availability. The study underscores the need for structured mentorship in undergraduate research to enhance engagement, skill development, and retention in STEM. Training graduate mentors, improving project alignment of projects and interests between graduate mentors and undergraduate researchers, and fostering clear mentor-mentee roles can strengthen research experiences. Future research should focus on developing adaptable mentorship framework with transferability to variety of institutional and disciplinary contexts."

For such real-time tasks, the limited access to initial tracking data can challenge the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods, thereby motivating the development of active sensing strategies. This paper addresses such problems and formulates the joint target tracking and sensor scheduling problems within a Bayesian optimisation framework. The key question that this framework answers is: where to position the sensors in order to accurately track an object. In the considered case study, the sensors are mobile and represented by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The active sensing of the environment is based on uncertainty-guided sampling thanks to a Gaussian process representation. The main novelty lies in the formulation of the sensor scheduling and tracking within a Bayesian optimisation setting. Under this framework, a detailed comparison of different acquisition functions is carried out, to identify the most suitable solutions for an active sensing problem. Results with respect to accuracy and computational time are reported."

However, this integration also expands the attack surface, making MIoT systems increasingly vulnerable to evolving cyber threats that jeopardize data privacy, system reliability, and patient safety. Addressing the limitations of static and reactive cybersecurity models, this study introduces a smart risk prediction model that ensures dynamic and privacy-preserving protection of MIoT networks. The proposed model uses a Deep Ridgelet Neural Network (DRNN) to monitor complex data flows across hospital systems and predict cyber events with high accuracy. The synthetic threat datasets and realistic attacks are integrated into discrete-event simulations to emulate diverse security incidents and stress-test system behavior under adversarial conditions. The findings reveal that the DRNN model demonstrates superior performance in detecting anomalies and forecasting risk levels, while maintaining patient data confidentiality. The dynamic nature of the model allows continuous learning from new threats, making adaptable across various MIoT environments. The proposed model enhances the resilience of healthcare systems by lightweight and privacy-aware cybersecurity solution."

It seeks to identify predominant challenges in students' development of computational thinking and summarize the replicable solution frameworks students developed to solve problems in different contexts. Our program leverages a horizontal learning approach integrating different learning fields including engineering, computational thinking, physical modeling, and science. This study involved 5th and 6th grade authentic science classrooms at two local intermediate schools over an entire school year. Five individual lesson plans on core curriculum science topics were designed for each grade where students assembled electronics including Arduino microcontrollers, motors, and sensors, and programmed the Arduinos with a visual-programming web application. By analyzing students' codes, common programming errors were noted and categorized according to computational thinking concepts in the lesson. Over the 33 computational thinking concepts embedded in all ten lesson plans, we identified three primary programming errors that the students struggled with the most, which included the implementation of delays, digital inputs and outputs, variables, and functions. Most students successfully completed the programming tasks, indicating that our sustained learning approach was effective in helping them grasp computational thinking concepts and apply these skills to solve practical problems. We also found a slight decrease in the programming errors students made between certain lessons, though this improvement was not consistent across all lessons. We examined the reasons behind these inconsistencies to provide insights guiding the refinement of future research design."

    "abstract": "Forecasting stock market behavior remains a challenging task due to the inherent volatility and non-linear dynamics of financial time series. This study proposes a robust prediction framework for modeling fluctuations in Pakistan’s equity market, specifically the KSE-100 Index, using PyTorch TabNet—a deep learning architecture optimized for tabular data. The analysis utilizes daily market returns from 2019 to 2023, incorporating key variables such as closing price, opening price, daily high, and daily low to estimate percentage changes in returns. Data preprocessing involves normalization, isolation-forest-based outlier detection, and systematic handling of missing values to ensure dataset integrity. Model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), achieving values of 0.0347 and 0.0618, respectively. These results demonstrate that TabNet provides competitive predictive accuracy compared with traditional and contemporary deep learning methods. Overall, the findings indicate that PyTorch TabNet offers a reliable and efficient solution for forecasting short-term movements in the KSE-100 Index, delivering valuable insights for investors, analysts, and financial decision-makers."

    "abstract": "Student dropout is a major challenge in Brazilian public higher education, particularly in computer science programs, where rates can exceed 40%. As most of Brazil's top universities are public and tuition-free, high dropout rates not only affect individual academic paths but also strain the broader educational system. This study investigates dropout factors beyond academic performance, incorporating socioeconomic variables, university admission methods, and the effects of the 2012 Quota Law, which reserves 25% of university admission slots for low-income students. This research explores how educational data mining, enhanced by socio-economic data, could identify key predictors of dropout in computer science programs. Using student data collected from a top federal university over the period 2013-2020, the study applies three machine learning algorithms - Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) - to build predictive models. The results show that the models achieved over 90% accuracy in predicting dropout. The most significant predictors include Grade Point Average (GPA), performance in introductory programming courses, and the mode of admission. These findings offer valuable insights for university administrators seeking to reduce dropout rates. While the study focuses on one institution, its implications extend across Brazil's federal university system, where similar admission and evaluation policies are employed. The findings suggest that combining academic and socio-economic data can inform more effective retention strategies in computer science programs."

    "abstract": "Deepfake generation has advanced rapidly, raising serious challenges for information integrity. Existing work has examined many detection scenarios, but resolution variation remains a relevant factor to investigate. This study presents a systematic evaluation of deepfake detectors under multi-scale inputs using the standardized DeepfakeBench framework. Four benchmark datasets (UADFV, Celeb-DF-v1, Celeb-DF-v2, and DFDCP) were downsampled to lower scales. Six detectors were assessed, representing naive (XceptionNet, EfficientNet-B4), frequency-based (SPSL, SRM), and spatial-based (UCF, RECCE) methods. Frame-level Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) was used for evaluation. The results show that detectors maintain stable performance at intermediate scales but all degrade substantially under extreme downsampling, reflecting their reliance on fine-grained spatial cues. Dataset complexity further shapes robustness, with simpler datasets yielding higher baselines but more realistic ones remaining challenging across all scales. Among the detectors, SRM (frequency-based) demonstrates the highest resilience to resolution loss, while UCF (spatial-based) achieves the strongest performance at moderate resolutions. These complementary strengths highlight the need for hybrid, resolution-invariant architectures that combine spatial and frequency cues to ensure consistent detection across diverse visual conditions."

This research aims to build city modelling from 3D orthomosaic techniques to be interactive, to make users interact, and to be used as virtual reality content. The method used is design and development research (DDR), which focuses on product design and development to provide a product solution. This research is a virtual reality content for tsunami simulation education. The research stages carried out from this DDR method are need analysis, design, development, testing, revision, implementation, and evaluation. The results of this study indicate that city modelling from 3D orthomosaic techniques, which are further processed using Blender and Unity software, can produce interactive 3D orthomosaic models to be used as virtual reality content.

    "abstract": "In the trend of the integration of global trade and digital technology, the problems of traditional paper bills of lading have become prominent. Smart contracts provide technical support for the innovation of electronic bills of lading. Based on the practices of enterprises such as COSCO Shipping, this paper explores the legal effect, judicial challenges, and related practical dilemmas of smart contracts in logistics electronic bills of lading. Smart contracts, relying on blockchain technology, possess characteristics such as immutability, serving as property rights vouchers, and automatic execution. They meet the provisions of the Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China on contracts and have legal effect. Enterprises like COSCO Shipping actively promote the application of electronic bills of lading, and international enterprises also have corresponding practices. However, smart contracts face challenges in judicial determination, including difficulties in the application of procedural laws and disputes over the property rights voucher attribute in substance. Additionally, there are major difficulties in technical implementation, such as industry collaboration barriers and technology adoption obstacles, as exemplified by the suspension of projects by leading enterprises. In the future, development should be promoted from aspects such as technical optimization, improvement of the legal framework, and construction of an industry - collaborative ecosystem to drive the digital transformation of the shipping industry."

The proposed CSRR design is a single-layer structure, comprising asymmetrically inclined L-shaped slits etched on the top conductor of 1.6mm thick FR-4 substrate, while the ground copper is fully removed to optimize its electromagnetic (EM) properties. The overall size of the structure is $22 \\times 22 \\times 1.6 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$, and it exhibits resonant frequencies at $\\mathbf{1 . 0 9 G H z}$ (encompassing $0.95 \\mathrm{GHz}-1.12 \\mathrm{GHz}$) and 1.2GHz (encompassing 1.14GHz 1.27GHz), with a comprehensive negative index response stretching from 0.5GHz to 1.27GHz. The resultant effective medium ratio of 12.86 validates the design efficiency and compactness of the structure. The unit-cell is placed strategically on the ground plane of an end-fire antenna intended for use in aviation navigation, arranged as an $3 \\times 3$ array. This coupling has led to significant improvement in impedance bandwidth from 7 MHz to 93 MHz, raising the fractional bandwidth from $0.71 \\%$ to $8.89 \\%$. The radiator performance is enhanced without compromising the antenna gain.

    "abstract": "It truly is an intelligent solution that minimizes the pesticide uses on the crop while maximizing the crop yield that is how the world is moving towards developments in sustainable agriculture. Traditional spraying methods generate two major problems concerning overuse of chemicals, environmental pollution, and labor efficiency. Recent investigations have delved into IoT-enable pesticide spraying robots which automate field operations [1] [4] and are capable of real time monitoring and increased spraying accuracy. It appears feasible with all these systems involved; scalability, connectivity, and adaptability become limiting factors in the wide array of agricultural environments. Also included are artificial intelligence systems able to do disease detection early enough combined with targeted pesticide application [5] [8]. This provides more accurate and autonomy-based operations. However, studies still remain specific on crops, consume not energy-efficient long-duration operate, and are still yet to achieve wide deployment. This research proposes the development of framework for autonomous and sustainable crop protection with IoT sensors, UAVs, and AI-driven multi-objective decision-making in a spraying system. The proposed framework depends on multi-sensor fusion, convolution neural networks for diseases identification, and reinforcement learning for adaptive spraying strategies. The system is designed to analyzes data in real-time and navigate an autonomous UAVs for precision pesticide applications while diminishing chemical wastes, costs, and environmental impacts. Saliently, these propositions is different from existing models in that it showcases scalability, cross-crop applications, and sustainability, thus being a strong solution for the next generation of precision agriculture."

The paper presents an Adaptive Geo-Contextual Experience Optimization Network (AGCEON) is a sophisticated hybrid learning architecture that can be used in predicting tourism tendencies, optimization visitor flow, as well as customizing the travel experience by combining real-time data. The model combines both geospatial and behavioral and environmental data streams obtained through IoT sensors, social media, and historical data to illustrate the interaction changes between travelers and destinations. AGCEON uses a Dual-Stream Attention Fusion system, where a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) is used to analyze temporal mobility on the spatial level, and Transformer-based Context Encoder is used to forecast temporal context intent. Reinforcement layer is an additional layer that ensures the optimization of suggestions and policy decisions provided by the constant feedback, which is provided in user satisfaction and sustainability indicators. The experimental verification process on the basis of various tourism data shows that the system offered is much more predictive, flexible and environmentalconscious than the traditional models. The framework is also providing valuable guidance to smart city planners and tourism business operators and regulators so that they can effectively utilize resources and enhance the participation of the traveler. Overall, AGCEON offers a long-term and intelligent move towards the creation of the data-driven smart tourism ecosystem. The overall accuracy of the proposed AGCEON model was at 96.1 percent to predict performance."

In response, Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a strategic security framework, grounded in the principle of “never trust, always verify.” This paper presents a systematic analysis of ZTA frameworks tailored for cloud-native environments, with a focus on the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in enhancing policy enforcement, anomaly detection, and trust evaluation. By mapping key developments in federated identity, workload-centric access control, and adaptive policy orchestration, we identify critical challenges such as cross-cloud policy synchronization, explainability gaps, and runtime enforcement blind spots. We make a clear claim: AI is the practical way to run Zero Trust in real multi-cloud systems. This paper moves from foundations, to a simple taxonomy, to a layered AI based design, so that engineers leave with a plan and researchers leave with a focused agenda."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) enables critical applications such as ocean monitoring, seismic prediction, and defense operations. However, underwater acoustic communication faces unique challenges, including limited bandwidth, high latency, energy constraints, and frequent link disruptions. These factors, coupled with the absence of robust trust mechanisms, make IoUT networks highly vulnerable to malicious attacks such as packet dropping, false data injection, and energy depletion, which degrade reliability and network lifetime. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Trust-Enabled Edge-Assisted Depth-Based Protocol (TE-EA-DBP) for secure and reliable data transmission in IoUT. The protocol incorporates a trust evaluation model to detect and isolate untrustworthy nodes based on forwarding behavior, reliability, and residual energy. To reduce the computational load on constrained nodes, edge-assisted processing is employed for trust assessment and Cluster Head (CH) election. Furthermore, a depth-based CH selection strategy balances energy consumption and ensures stable routing paths. Simulation results show that TE-EA-DBP achieves higher packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, and resilience to adversarial behavior compared with existing protocols, offering a scalable and dependable solution for underwater communication."

The use of Virtual Reality (VR) environments is becoming more common in applications such as healthcare, education, entertainment and training that aim to simulate the reality. However, the degree of personalization and interactivity of VR systems is a bottleneck. In this paper, we investigate the incorporation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time facial emotion recognition in VR context and incorporate multisensory feedback to enhance the user immersion and emotional understanding as well as overall experience realism. CNNs achieved relatively high performance in extracting and classifying facial features, in particular in emotion recognition from large scaled databases. In this paper, we propose a real-time user emotion (joy, anger, surprise, sadness, and neutrality) sensing CNN model for facial recognition. The model is designed for computational efficiency facilitating easy integration into Head-Mounted-Displays (HMD) based VR systems comprising of motion tracking systems. The simulation results show that the developed CNNbased emotion recognition model can achieve>90% accuracy in real-time inference, with latency under the critical thresholds for VR's native application. User studies also prove that emotion- based feedback increases immersion, empathy and task performance, with special attention to therapeutic and training simulations. This work is part of a novel paradigm in VR development: emotional adaptivity, by combining cutting edge computer vision and ASR with sensory feedback dep'09. The presented architecture forms the base of user-/emotionaware VR experiences. It creates new opportunities in affective computing, neurorehabilitation, virtual social interaction, and adaptive learning systems.

The BERT model calls for a lot of memory and processing capability to train given its millions of parameters. Based on BERT as a foundation, the approach uses whitening or sphering techniques as a dimension reduction method at the feature extraction stage. Along with a standard benchmark using the original BERT, a modified scenario is introduced that includes BERT feature extraction and whitening methods such as PCA-Whitening, ZCA-Whitening, and Bert whitening is clasified using Bi-LSTM and MLP. With four topic classes, the AG News dataset—which consists of news headlines and descriptions—forms the main center of attention for the research. Based on the results, modified scenario—which combines BERT features, BERT whitening, and a Bi-LSTM classifier performs best in terms of accuracy, F1 score, training time, and GPU memory usage. These results indicate that by means of whitening dimension reduction, text classification efficiency can be raised without sacrificing accuracy. By means of dimension reduction and parameter optimization, this work aims to improve the performance of complex models such as BERT, thereby enhancing artificial intelligence applications in resource-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "In the educational sector, data-based analytics has enabled appropriate forecasting and predicting of student success, creating deep concerns about data privacy and security. Traditional machine learning practices involve centralizing data collection, which is often infeasible because of privacy laws and limitations imposed by institutions. The authors propose a privacy-preserving federated weighted ensemble (FWE) strategy to predict student performance using distributed and heterogeneous datasets. In this approach, raw student data lives on the local machines, without sharing or disclosing, ensuring privacy, with model updates enhancing global training. Each local client (an institution) trains a local ensemble of a Logistic Regression and Random Forest machine learning model to account for linear and non-linear relationships in the data. Unlike traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) methods, their method adopts a data-aware weighting strategy for aggregation based on client dataset size and class balance, increasing robustness to the performance impacts of non-iid distributions on client data. The proposed framework is evaluated on a real-world student data set comprised of demographic, academic, and skills-based features across countries. The results suggest that the aggregate or global accuracy for the FWE is 98%, with a reasonable balance between low- and high-CGPA predictions. The ROC-AUC score is significantly above the threshold of 0.97, highlighting strong discrimination ability and resilience to heterogeneity. It demonstrates that the proposed framework not only maintains student data privacy, but also significantly improves predictive performance compared to FL baseline methods. Thus, the proposed framework is a scalable and privacy-preserving solution to educational analytics, allowing data collaborators to work together without compromise. In future work, we will further extend the ensemble with deep learning components, adaptive trust-based weighting, and to implement in a real-world federated infrastructure for large and scalable educational decision making."

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) UAVs track progress in advanced environments above ≥90% during the most challenging stages of their assignments related to search and rescue and monitoring. Still, operational trust toward autonomous systems remains low, resulting in unnecessary commands which lowers the success of the mission. To solve this problem, we present the framework TRUST-X which combines real-time explainable surrogate decision trees, SHAP-lite, contrastive explanations, and dynamic trust modeling within a looping feedback system. In simulations, TRUST-X provided interpretable insights that increased operator trust by ≥28% and decreased number of interventions by ≥37% at the same time maintaining ≥94% success rate of the mission. This surpasses the traditional DRL baselines by ≥15%. Results prove that TRUST-X increases visibility and improves the safety of human-drone operations. These are highly relevant for TRUST-X and its purpose to better support explainable human autonomous system collaborations."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a light time blockchain framework to address double-spend and 51% attacks in Proof-of-Work (PoW)-based IoT systems. The solution uses two algorithms in its design, DETCA and RNSA. The protocol uses two criteria-the least time taken by miners and the lowest number of operations-to select nodes, thereby reducing all the extra work. RNSA randomly picks <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\frac{\\mathbf{3}}{\\mathbf{4}}$</tex> of the nodes needed to verify blocks which greatly decreases the chances of attacks. Each simulation was done using node numbers between 10 and 175. The results demonstrate that mining time is 5.9 sec and verification time is 3.3 sec which is better when compared to previous PoW methods. Moreover, since no bad behavior was identified, double-spending and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 1 \\%}$</tex> attacks were prevented.

This project aims to provide financial scholarship support to 25 domestic, low-income, high-achieving students who demonstrate financial need at our private university. This scholarship will enable students to pursue four-year bachelor's degrees in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer Engineering, followed by a one-year accelerated master's degree in one of the following areas: Software Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, or Computer Science. We leverage evidence-based practices to foster student success and increase retention and degree attainment. Throughout the project, scholars receive continuous advising, mentoring, and academic monitoring to support their progress and success. This support comes in various forms, with faculty mentoring playing a central role. In this project, scholars are organized into cohorts based on their degree programs, with each cohort assigned a dedicated faculty mentor for the entirety of their college years. Our project currently includes five mentors, each of whom regularly meets with their cohort. Upon completing the first year of the project, we conducted IRB-approved semistructured interviews with faculty mentors. We then conducted a descriptive content analysis of the interview transcripts to identify key themes in their mentoring experiences. This paper presents the initial findings, highlighting both the challenges mentors encountered and the benefits they observed. These early insights offer a foundational understanding of how mentoring contributes to the project's success and may inform similar programs. Future work includes continued evaluation and refinement of the mentoring component."

Existing techniques highlighted sparse attention aimed at combined FFN-attention optimizations; these keep index structures bloated and memory-intensive. The above shortcomings are solved by the proposed FPGA-centric system that compresses indices using hybrid CSR encodings, quantizes with 4-8 bits, and maps all data to on-chip BRAM/URAM. The proposed system prevents repeated DRAM access, diminishes index dominance, and maintains performance across multiple concurrent sparse computation engines.

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of the cost prediction of power transmission and transformation projects (PTTP) in the current power grid construction, this paper proposes a model based on improved particle swarm optimization and least squares support vector machine (IPSO-LSSVM). Firstly, the key factors affecting the cost of PTTP are systematically sorted out from the three dimensions of project scale, technical parameters and external environment, and the corresponding eigenvectors are constructed as model inputs. In the model construction, the nonlinear inertia weight adjustment mechanism is introduced, which effectively improves the global exploration ability of PSO, and then optimizes the parameters in LSSVM to enhance the prediction accuracy. The actual data of 40 110kV PTTP in a region from 2015 to 2024 show that the proposed IPSO-LSSVM model performs well in both the training and the test sets. The root mean square error of the test set is 333500 yuan, the average absolute percentage error is only 4.17%, and the determination coefficient reaches 0.9029. All performance indicators are significantly better than the comparison model, showing the effectiveness of the model in capturing the complex nonlinear characteristics of the cost, and providing a scientific and reliable prediction tool for the cost management of PTTP."

These problems can be solved by engaging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided with embedded platforms and optical sensors. In this work, we focus on enabling onboard aerial image processing to ensure proper and real-time disaster detection. Such a setting usually causes challenges due to the limited hardware resources of UAVs. However, privacy, connectivity, and latency issues can be avoided. We suggest a UAV-assisted edge framework for disaster detection, leveraging our proposed model optimized for onboard real-time aerial image classification. The optimization of the model is achieved using post-training quantization techniques. To address the limited number of disaster cases in existing benchmark datasets and therefore ensure real-world adoption of our model, we construct a novel dataset, DisasterEye, featuring disaster scenes captured by UAVs and individuals on-site. Experimental results reveal the efficacy of our model, reaching high accuracy with lowered inference latency and memory use on both traditional machines and resource-limited devices. This shows that the scalability and adaptability of our method make it a powerful solution for real-time disaster management on resource-constrained UAV platforms.The code and DisasterEye dataset are available at: https://github.com/Branislava98/TensorRT."

Early diagnosis is a key opportunity for onset management and planning for quality of life management. Our original research questions envisioned both handwriting and speech features as a signal for early detection of PD. However, this portion of the study was focused on PD detection based on spiral images of handwriting, which were classified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained on grayscale images of spiral drawings, provided to the model after preprocessing and resizing to a standard dimension. Grad-CAM was implemented to develop interpretable heatmaps, showing relevant areas of the spiral images that were considered when concluding. The final CNN model was able to reliably classify PD from control subjects based on handwriting characteristics. Speech signal features were investigated but did not feature as part of this implementation. This research demonstrates that handwriting analysis with deep learning computes a non-invasive, interpretable approach for screening for Parkinson’s Disease at low cost, with multimodal extensions envisaged in future work."

The framework integrates sandboxed execution, on-the-fly test generation, and structured, stepwise explanatory reasoning, ensuring that students receive constructive, rubric-aligned feedback. To evaluate its effectiveness, the system was applied to anonymized submissions from a Data Mining module and complemented with open-source student code repositories. Performance was benchmarked against classic unit test-based auto-graders and LLM-only grading models, using five dimensions: grading accuracy, explanation quality, error coverage, and efficiency. Results demonstrate that Explain-then-Grade achieved higher grading reliability ($93 \\%$ accuracy, $\\kappa=0.85$), superior explanation quality (4.4/5), broader error coverage ($83.7 \\%$), and substantial time savings ($67 \\%$). These outcomes highlight its potential to support both traditional and open and distance learning (ODL) contexts by shifting automated assessment from mere evaluation toward formative, feedback-driven learning.

In light of this, this brief proposes a two-dimensional complex-valued rotational chaotic (2D-CRC) map. Theoretical analysis reveals that the 2D-CRC map exhibits chaotic behavior in terms of Lyapunov exponents. Property analysis shows that the 2D-CRC map exhibits rich dynamical behaviors, notably an inherent rotational property. Furthermore, a Zynq-based hardware implementation is employed to demonstrate the practical realizability of the generated strange attractors."

    "abstract": "Radar-based gesture recognition and person identification offer a natural, convenient, and privacy-preserving approach to human-computer interaction. However, most existing research focuses predominantly on learning for a single task, which requires separate models for each task. This separation increases the complexity of the deployment and the computational overhead. To address these challenges, this study introduces a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs gesture recognition and person identification using a miniature radar sensor. By leveraging radar's capacity to capture finegrained spectral and spatial motion patterns, the framework incorporates micro-Doppler and range-Doppler processing, alongside a multi-branch architecture to enhance modality-specific feature representation. It enables unified learning of shared and task-specific features within a single network architecture. The proposed model, MTxLSTM, integrates CNN and the recent xLSTM to mitigate task interference, improve generalization, and improve gesture recognition through person-specific nuances while enhancing person identification by leveraging contextual gesture information. Experimental results reveal that MTxLSTM outperforms existing multi-task learning frameworks and stateof- the-art models, achieving 99.21% in gesture recognition and 98.59% in person identification with moderate model complexity and inference speed. This study concurrently executes gesture recognition and person identification using a miniature radar sensor, and marking the first application of xLSTM in radar sensing technology."

As IoT continues to reshape technology and society, computer networks education must evolve to provide students with both practical skills and real-world insights. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to offer the hands-on experience and contextual understanding necessary to meet these demands. To address this gap, we developed a PBL module centered around IoT projects to enhance student learning outcomes in a computer networks course. The module aims to teach students: 1) modern applicationlayer protocols commonly used in IoT environments; 2) foundational IoT concepts, including IoT devices and the performance requirements of IoT applications; 3) practical skills in building and debugging network applications on IoT devices, covering topics such as IP addressing, private and public networks, network debugging tools, Raspberry Pi operations, and sensors with GPIO ports; and 4) problem-solving and collaboration skills through the design and implementation of IoT projects. Spanning four weeks, the module combines lectures, guided tutorials, and team-based projects culminating in a hands-on IoT application. The module was implemented in a senior-level Computer Networks course with 47 students in Fall 2024. A mixedmethods evaluation, including student reflections and instructor observations, revealed significant improvements in students' understanding of networking concepts and their ability to apply them in IoT contexts. Furthermore, student feedback highlighted the importance of real-world relevance and teamwork in enhancing their learning experience. These findings provide valuable insights for designing PBL modules that effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in computer science education."

This study presents a robust adaptive PID control algorithm that is model-independent, simple, and suitable for deployment on commercial PID-equipped devices. The proposed adaptive PID control is based on a modified version of adaptive time-delay control employing modified Nussbaum functions to ensure stability under substantial variations of robot and environment dynamics, and includes straightforward gain drift prevention schemes. The performance of the proposed adaptive PID control was experimentally evaluated with other PID controls and advanced model-independent control, showing enhanced robustness and no gain drift. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed PID control for immediate deployment in industrial robots with a PID-equipped controller."

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of abandoned luggage detection by adapting a YOLOv11 model and validating it on the IITP20 dataset. Our methodology involves optimizing our pre-trained YOLOv11 model for the domain adaptation to specific characteristics of the IITP20 dataset. Our initial analysis revealed significant semantic inconsistencies within the dataset’s annotations; a large portion of “abandoned” luggage instances were simply items in lockers or storage areas, which do not constitute security threats. To create a more realistic benchmark, we systematically corrected these inaccuracies. A comparative analysis reveals that our person and baggage detection model, along with the proposed algorithm, achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating exceptional performance in scenarios relevant to security surveillance. These findings underscore the robustness of our detection approach and emphasize the importance of high-quality, semantically accurate annotations for developing reliable abandoned object detection systems in real-world applications."

An automated profiling framework was developed using bash shell scripting integrated within the Android Studio IDE, leveraging ADB utilities such as top, logcat, and dumpsys for data collection. Controlled user scenarios, executed via Espresso automation, simulated browsing and selection activities in a custom Android e-Commerce simulation application under Dark Mode and Light Mode settings. Frame rendering durations and CPU usage were captured across multiple iterations to evaluate processing demands. Results indicate minimal differences, with CPU utilization averaging 31.0% in Dark Mode vs. 31.4% in Light Mode, and rendering times differing by less than 10 ms between configurations., suggesting that UI theme selection alone does not significantly influence runtime efficiency. These findings highlight the need for deeper optimization strategies beyond visual configurations in the pursuit of sustainable mobile application development."

    "abstract": "This research category full paper provides new insights into the impact of specific transitions (i.e. patterns) between the different activities (session start, video, forum, problems, and pass/fail) when learners engage with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Many previous contributions have computed variables related to learners' engagement with the materials, but transitions between activities might also provide meaningful information. In this line, this work aims to analyze learners' patterns in an edX MOOC about Java Programming to discover which patterns are more frequent, their variations over time and depending on the learner's performance and their relationships with the final grade. Results show that sessions often start with videos and learners who pass are more likely to show patterns including use of the forums, and their last interaction is often with a problem. Conversely, learners who fail mostly drop out after interacting with videos. Moreover, patterns show that many learners who fail do not interact with the course in the first week. Furthermore, the most correlated patterns with grades are the transitions video-problem, problem-problem, and problemvideo, and these patterns by themselves can achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.131 when predicting grades, which shows the potential of considering these patterns when analyzing student models."

Traditional LiDAR scanners often face limitations in capturing complete surface geometry due to restricted fields of view and blind spots. The proposed system utilizes a reflective mirror base to reflect laser beams toward otherwise unobservable areas, thereby enhancing data acquisition without additional mechanical complexity. The captured point clouds are further refined using an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm combined with pose graph optimization to ensure accurate alignment and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate up to 143% improvement compared to conventional fixed-position LiDAR setups. These results validate the effectiveness of a mirror-based scanner along with the incorporation of SLAM. This offers an adaptable solution for high-accuracy 3D scanning of small objects in controlled environments."

The existing unsupervised solvers for EIT trade attention to the image domain with ignorance to physical natures in the electrical field. In this article, we propose an unsupervised conditional diffusion model, referred to as SPfusion, for inhomogeneous sensitivity prior generation, which is utilized as the system matrix to solve EIT inverse problem. The conditional diffusion model first undergoes coarse training to ensure stable generation, followed by a dedicated fine training to sharpen detailed fidelity. In SPfusion, we propose a novel dual-domain denoising network, named dual-domain sensitivity prior network, that introduces the dual-domain Cartesian-based and polar-based coordinates dual-domain Transformer to efficiently capture multiscale latent representations. In addition, the decoder with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">U</i>-conditional cross-attention is proposed to fully preserve dual-domain long-range dependencies. SPfusion achieves accurate noise estimation, high-fidelity detail generation of the inhomogeneous sensitivity prior, as well as high-quality image reconstructions based on model-driven methods. Experiments conducted on simulation data, real-world measurements, and publicly available benchmark demonstrate that SPfusion outperforms supervised/unsupervised and previous diffusion-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and stability.

    "abstract": "OPC UA (IEC 62541) is a protocol used in industrial control systems and building automations. The protocol is intrinsically stateful. In fact, it involves session handshakes, secure channels, and subscriptions. Its statefulness makes standard (stateless) fuzzers inefficient in finding bugs that rely deeply on the state model. In this paper, we present our practical experience in fuzzing the OPC UA protocol using three stateful fuzzers, namely AFLNet, ChatAFL, and LibAFLstar. For each fuzzer, we explain how to prepare the harness, collect the inputs, and run them. We compare the fuzzers on four different metrics: setup complexity, edge coverage, execution throughput, and time to find the first bug. Moreover, we present the steps to add a new case study (FreeOpcUA) to ProFuzzBench, a benchmarking framework widely used to compare the effectiveness of stateful fuzzers. Our experiments show that AFLNet is the easiest to configure, achieving solid coverage and fastest bug discovery. ChatAFL slightly improves coverage using LLM-expanded seeds with similar integration effort. LibAFLstar, while requiring the most setup effort, achieves the highest throughput across three tested configurations, but paradoxically the worst performance. In fact, we found that higher throughput does not translate into better bug finding and coverage without properly handling protocol complexities like sequence numbers. This experience paper presents the challenges, limitations, and performance trade-offs of each fuzzer, providing actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to apply stateful fuzzing to complex industrial protocols."

    "abstract": "The dynamic evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) threats necessitates reliable network intrusion detection (NID) systems. Such systems should not only respond to known security risks but also adapt effectively to emerging threats. However, practical deployments in novel IoT environments often suffer from significant data scarcity. In these cases, only a few labeled samples are available for training, which typically leads to poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce a Semi-supervised Meta-negatIve-LEarning approach, termed SMILE, for few-shot network intrusion detection using network traffic data. Our approach begins by pretraining a baseline NID model with historical attack data, followed by an improved negative learning strategy with uncertainty-aware pseudo-negative labels. Bagging sampling is further incorporated to dynamically balance pseudo-labeled data distributions and enhance tolerance to labeling errors. SMILE enables effective knowledge transfer from historical attacks to few-shot traffic streams. Experimental results on the CICIDS-2017 dataset demonstrate that SMILE significantly improves detection accuracy by 7.30%–16.65% across diverse classifier architectures in both 5-shot and 10-shot scenarios, achieving a peak accuracy of 81.91%. Additional validation on the Edge-IIoT and IoT-23 datasets shows consistent improvements of 9.38% and 4.78%, reaching respective accuracies of 96.25% and 84.08% under 10-shot detection."

    "abstract": "To better find community in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, a new model, namely RW-HeCo, is presented, which uses network centrality measures together with random walks and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Conventional methods tend to use meta-path-based neighbour aggregate, where all the paths are considered. Not every metapath connection is importantly related to community structure, though. To overcome this inefficiency, RW-HeCo incorporates centrality-based filtering in the process and thus promotes structural importance of nodes and edges. On top of the random walks which already give stochastic traversal-based information, co-contrastive learning is used to further distinguish signal (meaningful node interactions) and noise. Such a combination enables the model to oftently represent the semantic, temporal, and structural properties of heterogeneous graphs. Its effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated on four benchmark datasets, namely ACM, AMiner, DBLP and Freebase, and the method shows its superiority in both tie strength prediction and community detection in assessment with the SOTA methods. Thanks to the priority given to node significance and the centrality-based improvements, the RWHeCo can advance the precision of community identification aside from leading to a better understanding of network evolution. It is thus very useful in dynamic large-scale network systems, e.g., social media, citation graph and knowledge graphs, where structural insight and community borders are critical. The offered system outperformed various approaches with the maximum NMI of 70.6% and Micro-F1 score of 72.1% on the BlogCatalog dataset. It clearly outdid GCN, GAT and Label Propagation."

The study is extended to a 10-cell battery module subjected to dynamic drive cycles and monthly ambient temperature variations.

Capacity fade analysis reveals that under natural convection, the module achieves a cycle life of approximately 1000 cycles. In contrast, with conditioned air cooling, the cycle life exceeds 2200 cycles due to significantly lower average cell temperatures and reduced thermal stress. These insights support the development of efficient thermal management systems to enhance battery durability in real-world conditions."

MDMs, categorized as organizational, interpretive, and epistemic functions, provide insights into how instructors organize discourse, facilitate knowledge-building, and manage uncertainty within classroom discussions, as well as its impact on student cognitive processing, meaning negotiation, and engagement. VN structures, such as ‘analyze data’ or ‘construct explanations,’ indicate the cognitive demands expected from students, helping instructors assess alignment with intended learning objectives. Using a custom Python function leveraging natural language processing, VN pairs are extracted to reveal patterns aligned with frameworks such as Bloom's Taxonomy and to support integration with classroom observation protocols like Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) and the Classroom Discourse Observation Protocol (CDOP). In addition to VN analysis, by tracking the frequency and function of MDMs, we examine how instructional language fosters coherence, engagement, and epistemic positioning in STEM education. This complementary analysis enables a holistic view of teaching effectiveness by integrating both action-based linguistic structures and discourse organization strategies. Tracking both the frequency and nature of these action phrases and discourse markers enables instructors to reflect on the alignment between their teaching practices and intended learning objectives. Preliminary analysis suggests variation across instructors in their discursive stance and cognitive expectations, offering potential for enhanced instructional self-reflection."

    "abstract": "Engineering students can use generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in ways that support their learning, but they can also use GenAI to complete entire assignments, thereby circumventing their learning. While local and global standards evolve, it is important for instructors to specify when and how to use GenAI tools appropriately, and to support and measure students' acquisitions of knowledge, competence, and ethical dispositions towards GenAI tools. This study investigated student perspectives on ethical uses of GenAI for schoolwork, following the discussion and integration of GenAI into an introduction to engineering course. The integration included a student-led discussion around GenAI following an engineering ethics lecture, and guided GenAI use in a final course programming assignment. The research question was as follows: What are first-year engineering students' opinions on the ethics of GenAI after instruction on GenAI and instruction on engineering ethics? At the end of the semester, students responded to essay-style questions about appropriate and inappropriate uses of GenAI tools within engineering school. Responses were coded inductively with three researchers using qualitative thematic analysis. Results revealed that students knew that completing entire assignments with GenAI was academically dishonest and presents a threat to both their learning and professional competence. Students also acknowledged that, when used as a tool, GenAI could improve their work product. Beyond these consistencies, there were also many different opinions about ethics, demonstrating a need for instructors to set clear expectations. Course integrations of GenAI appear to be powerful teaching opportunities to help students learn about GenAI and engage in meaningful ethical reflections around using GenAI tools for coursework and their future careers."

Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time (RT) requirements. In this article, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions (BCs) while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders-of-magnitude faster."

In this work, we develop a mapping and navigation system for object-goal navigation that, from the ground up, considers the possibilities that a queried object can have moved, or may not be mapped at all. Instead of striving for high-fidelity mapping detail, we consider that the main purpose of a map is to provide environment grounding and context, which we combine with the semantic priors of LLMs to reason about object locations and deploy an active, online approach to navigate to the objects. Through simulated and real-world experiments we find that our approach tends to have higher retrieval success at shorter path lengths for static objects and by far outperforms prior approaches in cases of dynamic or unmapped object queries."

    "abstract": "Recently, incorporating Retinex theory with unfolding networks has attracted increasing attention in the low-light image enhancement field. However, existing methods have two limitations, i.e., ignoring the modeling of the physical prior of Retinex theory and relying on a large amount of paired data. To advance this field, we propose a novel self-supervised unfolding network, named S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>UNet, for the LIE task. Specifically, we formulate a novel optimization model based on the principle that content-consistent images under different illumination should share the same reflectance. The model simultaneously decomposes two illumination-different images into a shared reflectance component and two independent illumination components. Due to the absence of the normal-light image, we process the low-light image with gamma correction to create the illumination-different image pair. Then, we translate this model into a multi-stage unfolding network, in which each stage alternately optimizes the shared reflectance component and the respective illumination components of the two images. During progressive multi-stage optimization, the network inherently encodes the reflectance consistency prior by jointly estimating an optimal reflectance across varying illumination conditions. Finally, considering the presence of noise in low-light images and to suppress noise amplification, we propose a self-supervised denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>UNet outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving competitive performance compared to supervised methods.

Advanced stacked machine learning methodology was adopted training and optimizing six base models (Random Forest, Extra Trees Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Nu Support Vector Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light GBM).

The Performance Ratio (PR) is one of the key measures of a PV system’s efficiency in converting solar irradiance into usable AC electricity. To measure the impact of atmospheric temperature on the performance of the system, this paper assesses the conventional and temperature-adjusted PR of the plant using PVsyst software. Real operational data are obtained from the SCADA system and weather stations of the power plant for the year 2023, while the corresponding simulated data are generated using SolarGIS inputs in PVsyst software. To ascertain deviations in PR based on temperature, a monthly comparison of actual and simulated results is performed. The results indicate that ambient temperature greatly affects the effectiveness of the plants, which increases PR in winter and reduces PR in summer. Temperature correction gives a better realistic simulation of how PV plants can operate in local climatic conditions. The findings will help in designing, operating, and maintaining strategies of the large-scale solar plants in hot areas, i.e., Southern Punjab, Pakistan."

This paper proposes hybrid models that integrate lightGBM with transformer-based architectures to improve forecasting using temporal features. The PeMS-08 dataset (approximately 100,000 records,5-minute intervals, July– August 2016) is employed for evaluation. Standalone lightGBM, transformer, and triformer models are first benchmarked. In the hybrid design, lightGBM captures feature-level temporal patterns, while transformer architectures refine sequential dependencies. Experimental results show that both hybrid models significantly outperform transformer and triformer baselines. The lightGBM+triformer hybrid achieves performance comparable to standalone lightGBM, with lower Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE), indicating improved robustness and reduced forecast bias. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining gradient boosting and transformer-based architectures for traffic flow prediction. The proposed framework contributes to more accurate and reliable traffic forecasting, supporting real-time management and sustainable urban mobility planning."

    "abstract": "Efficiently and reliably solving nonlinear differential equations continues to be a core barrier in science and engineering, since conventional analytical and numerical techniques can often be costly in computation time, become nonconvergent under severe conditions, or are difficult to adapt to a novel problem. This work proposes a machine learning framework that proposes approximate solutions by learning the underlying functional relationships directly from observational data. First, the work frames nonlinear dynamics in a larger mathematical framework and systematically considers the implicit limitations of classical methods, such as direct and iterative finite difference schemes, finite element methods, and transcendent Runge-Kutta methods. Second, it considers recent advancements in data-driven modeling approaches with a focus on fully-connected neural networks (FNN), support vector regression (SVR), and physics-informed (PINN) methods, all which are promising approaches to recovering the behavior of nonlinear systems. The last section integrates a deep multi-layer neural network with case-specific loss functions that capture the structure of the underlying differential equations and ensures that the learned representation is consistent with conservation and balance concepts. Finally, benchmark evaluations with synthetic and traditional datasets show that the new architecture outperforms the predictive accuracy and computation times of existing classical solvers and machine learning models. Ultimately, the framework offers robust performance across a broader range of nonlinear scenarios-including chaotic trajectories and cases with discontinuous coefficients. These findings demonstrate the power of hybrid approaches with AI and mathematical methods to tackle difficult scientific challenges. They represent a strong and early start to exploring deeper thoughts in scientific machine learning and symbolic regression, specific to systems characterized by nonlinear differential equations. The combination of classical numerical approaches and modern AI techniques will foster the progress of more powerful, larger scale, and also more interpretable algorithms for nonlinear differential systems."

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) shifts from cloud to edge, optimizing models across heterogeneous layers is crucial. Quantization reduces numerical precision, improving model size, inference speed and energy efficiency, key for edge deployments. However, its complexity limits accessibility. To address this, we propose Quantization-as-a-Service (QaaS), a serverless framework that automates model quantization for both cloud and edge environments. Built on OpenFaaS and Kubernetes, QaaS enables on-demand execution with dynamic resource orchestration, implementing Layer 5 of Edge Intelligence (EI). Our evaluation compares quantization performance on edge devices in terms of CPU usage and execution time when performed as a service versus locally. Results demonstrate that deploying quantization workflows using Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) not only maintains computational efficiency but also reduces CPU consumption compared to standalone execution, showcasing the potential of serverless solutions in EI."

The proposed paper represents a deep learning framework based on Bi-LSTMs to detect fraud in financial transactions in real time. A very skewed dataset that consisted of 92.5 percent legitimate and 7.5 percent fraudulent transactions was used to test the system. The model recorded high performance with an accuracy of 91.8, F1-score 90.5 and PR-AUC of 0.94 compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms like the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The confusion matrix analysis proved the ability of the framework to identify many fraudulent transactions and reduce the possibility of false positives, which is appropriate to use in operations. In addition, the latency of the inferences of 95 ms per transaction proved that the model can be used to detect fraud in high-volume digital payment systems in real-time. These results support the opportunity of deep learning-based solutions to increase the security of UPI transactions and improve the financial ecosystems."

To comprehensively promote rural revitalization, it is necessary to first optimize and upgrade the agricultural supply chain, and enhance the resilience of the green agricultural supply chain, which has profound significance for the high-quality development of the agriculture. The measurement of supply chain resilience is a practical tool for identifying the risk. Based on the analysis of the practical needs of supply chain resilience measurement, this paper constructs a resilience measurement index system for green agricultural supply chains in Hubei province, focusing on the four capabilities of risk resistance, emergency response, adaptation and recovery, and sustainable development. The entropy method is used to measure the resilience of green agricultural supply chains in Hubei province in the past five years, and combined with the analysis results of the model and the actual situation of green agriculture development in Hubei province, a path to improve the resilience of agricultural supply chains in Hubei province is proposed."

We benchmark a short-text baseline (TF-IDF with a logistic regression) against a fine-tuned transformer (DistilBERT) under author-grouped train/validation/test split sets. Experiments report Top-1/Top-3 accuracy and Macro-F1, analyze class imbalance under Full and Merge-Rare label schemes, and include a focused case study on adjacent two-letter LCC classes to characterize short-title confusions. Results show that title-only classification is feasible, where the single-stage DistilBERT model achieves the strongest Macro-F1 and the twostage variant improves the baseline (especially under the Full scheme) by reducing off-class errors, but decreases the effectiveness of DistilBERT. Besides, Top-3 suggestions support human cataloging when only titles are available."

Among various data security techniques, steganography, which conceals data within digital media, has emerged as a prominent solution. However, conventional methods often fail to achieve a sufficient balance between high data embedding capacity and the preservation of diagnostic image quality, limiting their practical use in clinical settings. To address this, this paper introduces BASMEDSecure, a novel data hiding framework that utilizes a logistic regression model to classify pixels based on their intensity levels. An adaptive embedding algorithm then utilizes this classification to dynamically adjust the number of secret data bits hidden within each pixel’s least significant bit. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance for the proposed BASMEDSecure, with a PSNR (expressing the quality of the stego image) ranging from 52.103 to 75.521 decibels (dB). The obtained SSIM value of 0.9999 highlights a close similarity between the cover and stego medical images, emphasizing the efficiency of BASMEDSecure in maintaining image integrity, which is crucial for accurate medical interpretations."

Rehabilitation for patients with hemiparesis due to stroke is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the recovery process through the assistance of active external power in repetitive movements that follow safe trajectories and Range of Motion (RoM) parameters. The exoskeleton is designed to perform movements with seven Degrees of Freedom (DoF), adjustable to the patient’s body dimensions. This study evaluates the performance of repetitive flexion-extension movements at the elbow joint, demonstrating that the exoskeleton can accurately follow the predefined trajectory. A motor current sensor is integrated into the electrical design to detect the presence of spasticity during rehabilitation sessions. With a feedback-based control system, the proposed exoskeleton platform shows potential for use as a homecare rehabilitation medium for patients with upper limb hemiparesis."

Various sensing technologies, including AIS, SAR, optical and infrared sensors, as well as UAV-mounted sensors, clearly enhance maritime awareness. However, integrating their diverse outputs remains complex. Feature-level multi-modal sensor fusion is a well-known methodology for robust detection and behavior analysis. However, most research relies on simulations or isolated sensors, which limits practical insights. This study presents a controlled real-world experiment combining synchronized data from coastal ground sensors and UAVmounted visual and infrared sensors. The recorded dataset enables the evaluation of feature-level fusion in authentic conditions. We enhance existing fusion frameworks with additional modules and assess them using operational metrics. This study contributes to our understanding of the efficacy of multi-modal fusion in complex maritime environments, while also highlighting the significant challenges involved in transitioning from simulations to controlled real-world sensor data."

Will it help make shopping and enjoying content more enjoyable and efficient or will it destroy the trust of the users by creating privacy concerns. These are the issues this article has attempted to discuss and investigate. Artificial Intelligence (AI) personalization is a very helpful and useful feature, but there must remain a proper balance between personalization and data collection in order to ensure client comfort. A transparent and honest collection of data is to be expected for almost all the companies and this data is to be used responsibly. Activities like profiling must be regulated and controlled and should not be left unregulated. Despite laws being updated to be more considerate towards the privacy of users, the development of better enforcement is imperative. Regardless of the presence of appropriate laws, it is important that each individual practice the respective ethics while present in the digital universe. This article is discussed about AI personalization issues and its research challenges."

    "abstract": "A Vehicular Ad Hoc Network is a set of mobile nodes forming a temporary multi-hop connection with the help of other vehicles and connected to roadside units (RSU) also. The absence of any authority from vehicle to vehicle invites many attackers that modify data, lose data, and degrade the utilization of resources. The vehicles are moving on roads with different velocities and may be possible to follow same direction or choose any other direction. Links between the vehicles are created and break in unpredictable way, which makes pretty challenging. The role of intermediate vehicles on route to forwards the traffic information to receiver. The sybil attack behaviour is a type of active attack that generates multiple identities (IDs) to gain the data from the network and drop it. The attacker node utilizes the network by spoofing the IP or MAC address, which is able to damage the complete network for personal gain. In this article the proposed sybil attack detection and protection using dynamic trust detection and prevention (SyDTDP) in VANET. The SyDTDP is focused on determining the packet loss caused by malicious activity. The article places more emphasis on malicious attacker node detection that is part of the route exploit and drops data in the communication, which decreases the overall performance of the network. The attacker's loss is more than the loss of a channel. The proposed SyDTDP detects attacker nodes and calculates the trust factor for each node, whether that node is an attacker or not. The result section compares the performance of Sybil attack detection using extreme machine learning (SyDVELM) with dynamic trust-based Sybil attack detection and prevention (SyDTDP) and gets the outcome in terms of packet receiving, number of packets captured during Sybil attacker and proposed methods, routing load, and average delay (ms). The results conclude that the proposed dynamic trust performs well in all network parameters as compared to existing security systems. The simulation of the network is done by Network Simulator 2 and deploys the VANET scenario of the attacker, SyDVELM, and the proposed SyDTDP."

    "abstract": "The detection and analysis of features in fluid flow are important tasks in fluid mechanics and flow visualization. One recent class of methods to approach this problem is to first compute objective optimal reference frames, relative to which the input vector field becomes as steady as possible. However, existing methods either optimize locally over a fixed neighborhood, which might not match the extent of interesting features well, or perform global optimization, which is costly. We propose a novel objective method for the computation of optimal reference frames that automatically adapts to the flow field locally, without having to choose neighborhoods a priori. We enable adaptivity by formulating this problem as a moving least squares approximation, through which we determine a continuous field of reference frames. To incorporate fluid features into the computation of the reference frame field, we introduce the use of a scalar guidance field into the moving least squares approximation. The guidance field determines a curved manifold on which a regularly sampled input vector field becomes a set of irregularly spaced samples, which then forms the input to the moving least squares approximation. Although the guidance field can be any scalar field, by using a field that corresponds to flow features the resulting reference frame field will adapt accordingly. We show that using an FTLE field as the guidance field results in a reference frame field that adapts better to local features in the flow than prior work. However, our moving least squares framework is formulated in a very general way, and therefore other types of guidance fields could be used in the future to adapt to local fluid features."

As a solution to these issues in this paper, the author proposes the Adaptive Cloud-Driven Cognitive Insight Framework (ACCIF) - a sophisticated and smart system that is created to support better strategic marketing decisions based on real-time cloud integration and cognition analytics. The suggested framework integrates the multi-source marketing data such as consumer behavior, sentiment patterns, and market dynamics into a cognition architecture based on the cloud technology. Through neurosymbolic logic and the adaptive learning strategies, ACCIF actively optimizes the marketing knowledge according to the changing consumer scenarios and this is forecasted by predictive factors. The model is based on elastic cloud computing to support scalable computing to achieve continuous learning and quick deployment of models in distributed setting. Furthermore, there is a contextual inference module that the user preferences and cross-channel engagement intentions are latent and interpreted, which supports hyper-personalized hyper-targeted marketing therapies. Experimental approval through massive datasets shows a higher level of accuracy of response, adaptability, and ability to be cost effective in comparison to traditional analytics systems. The suggested framework offers a solid road to intelligent, data-driven marketing evolution, which guarantees higher agility, accuracy, and competitiveness of organizations that can be found in the swiftly developing digital markets. Finally, ACCIF converts raw marketing data to actionable, cognitive intelligence, which will be the merger between the computational efficiency and strategic cognition. The suggested ACCIF model attained an overall accuracy of 94.6%, exhibiting enhanced performance relative to current methodologies."

    "abstract": "This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis and comparison of two prominent AI-based Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms: Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), under rapidly changing solar irradiance. The system, modeled in Simulink, consists of a solar photovoltaic (PV) array connected to a boost converter, which is controlled by the respective MPPT algorithms. The FLC employs a two-input, single-output rule-based system, while the ANN is a feedforward network trained on a large dataset of PV voltage and current measurements under varying conditions. Simulation results under dynamic irradiance profiles demonstrate that both controllers effectively track the maximum power point (MPP). However, the ANN-based MPPT consistently outperforms the FLC, exhibiting a faster transient response, reduced steady-state oscillations, and higher overall tracking efficiency. Specifically, the FLC shows pronounced undershoots and overshoots during abrupt irradiance changes, which lead to a notable decrease in efficiency and slower settling times. In contrast, the ANN recovers almost instantaneously with minimal fluctuations. The findings establish that the ANN-based approach offers superior dynamic performance and robustness, making it a more suitable intelligent control strategy for PV systems operating in environments with frequent and rapid weather fluctuations."

However, current token pruning approaches for inference acceleration face notable limitations: attention-based or threshold-based strategies risk discarding semantically important tokens, while methods that introduce additional training objectives increase optimization complexity. To address this problem, we propose SemPrune, a semantics-preserving token pruning method designed to reduce communication overhead in split inference architectures. SemPrune does not require labeled data for training. Instead, it learns a predictor to determine the optimal pruning ratio. SemPrune combines L2-norm-based importance scoring with a learned pruning ratio predictor trained by a semantics-preserving loss, enabling adaptive token retention while minimizing activation size. Experimental results across multiple log datasets show that SemPrune substantially reduces activation transmission to only 0.59%–1.75% of the original, while maintaining comparable accuracy with minimal F1 score degradation for anomaly detection."

The paper uses a fuzzy Mamdani-type system with a rule base of 1023 rules and implementation in MATLAB using Gaussian membership functions.

Therefore, a reliable benchmark and automatic model for AIGI evaluation is desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. To this end, we present CompBench, the largest dataset for benchmarking and comparing image generation, which features: (i) the largest AIGI pair comparison dataset, comprising 616,346 carefully curated image pairs generated by 24 state-of-the-art AIGI models annotated with 1.6M+ human annotations, enabling robust relative quality assessment through pairwise comparison, (ii) multi-dimensional pairwise comparison from perceptual and text-image correspondence perspectives across three difficulty levels, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2I generation models and AIGI comparison models. Based on CompBench, we propose LMM4Comp, a LMM-based evaluation metric that learns nuanced quality distinctions from multiple dimensions for pairwise comparison at both instance level and model level. Experiments demonstrate that LMM4Comp achieves state-of-the-art performance, highly aligning to human preference.

MYMI integrates LLM, and speech-to-text (STT) and text-tospeech (TTS) which powers the AI interviewer. MYMI features a code editor with a support for multiple languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++, allowing interviewees to practice in the coding language they are the most comfortable with.

    "abstract": "The tremendous growth in volume and complexity of cyberattacks poses significant challenges to the conventional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) which cannot keep pace with emergent threats and usually produce large volumes of false-positives. The present paper overcomes these shortcomings through the creation of a machine learning-based IDS on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark dataset, an actual network traffic model, and nine modern types of attacks, such as Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, and Worms. The proposed framework is associated with the high rate of detection and effective generalization due to thorough data preprocessing, sophisticated feature engineering, and a comparative analysis of the best models on the market, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The ensemble approaches provide accuracy and more than 95% recall in multiclass attack recognition. The feature importance analysis identifies the most important network behaviors that can indicate attacks. Generally, the results indicate that the current data-driven IDS systems, when based on comprehensive datasets, can go a long way in detecting, preparing, and securing against cyber threats to the modern digital systems."

    "abstract": "Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are a major health problem in Indonesia, with West Java Province recording the highest number of cases in 2023. The surge cases in this region are allegedly caused by exposure to air pollution and changing climate conditions. This study aims to analyze the spatio-temporal relationship between eight environmental variables (temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, concentrations of PM10, SO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, O<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf>, CO) and the monthly distribution of ARI cases throughout 2023. The method used was a Bayesian approach with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) as a prominent method in spatio-temporal analysis. Four model configurations of BYM1-RW1, BYM1-RW2, BYM2-RW1, and BYM2-RW2 were compared. The evaluation results indicated that the best model was BYM2–RW2, with DIC and RMSE values of 2,824.58 and 265.3, respectively. Relative Risk (RR) mapping showed the three highest values in July in Sumedang (5.29), August in Bandung Regency (4.52), and June in Ciamis (3.08). Meanwhile, the highest Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) was found in Subang in September (18.2), and the lowest SIR values were recorded in Sumedang in September (0.089). These results reinforce the finding that air quality and climate conditions play a significant role in the spatial and temporal patterns of ARI spread. The results of this study highlight the significant role of air pollution and climate conditions in the spatiotemporal spread of ARI and can be used as a scientific foundation for developing health interventions and policies that are more responsive to environmental risk factors."

    "abstract": "Digital Surface Models (DSMs) are fundamental to urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management applications. However, the inherent low spatial resolution of DSMs derived from satellite and aerial imagery significantly constrains their utility for detailed spatial analysis. This paper presents a novel deep learning framework that addresses this limitation through semantic-guided super-resolution using a singleview high-resolution image. Our approach integrates semantic features extracted from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with traditional low-resolution DSMs and RGB imagery to enhance reconstruction quality. The framework employs a specially designed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that incorporates semantic-aware feature extraction and multi-modal data fusion modules. By leveraging semantic understanding from highresolution single-view images, our method provides enhanced contextual guidance for DSM reconstruction, particularly in complex urban environments where precise object delineation is crucial. Through comprehensive evaluation on the ISPRS Potsdam Dataset, our semantic-guided DSM super-resolution (SG-DMSR) model demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional approaches, achieving a PSNR increase of 2.3% and SSIM improvement of 3.5% while maintaining computational efficiency. The results highlight the significant potential of semantic context integration from single-view imagery for enhancing geospatial data reconstruction quality without requiring multiple viewpoints or additional sensors."

    "abstract": "This study shows a novel technique to teach English writing with AI. People are the focus of the multi-level structure. It improves pupils' literary reading, comprehension, and analysis. Language, cognitive, and emotional development are included. Great teachers employ constructive criticism and interpretive reasoning. Most AI-based education systems focus on text analytics, but our paradigm emphasizes context and emotional connections. Learning is more fun and engaging. Vector-based modeling, semantic clustering, and reward-driven feedback improve reading. Affective computing helps the system adjust voice, style, and speed based on how the learner feels, such as joyful, curious, or concentrated. This model outperforms others in twelve key categories, including cognitive depth, emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, and input correctness, according to studies. The method produces more uniform interpretations, speedier analysis, and happier pupils. This study examines how combining AI with humanistic education alters AI-assisted learning. Along with training technical skills, it examines how AI might increase critical thinking, empathy, and long-term motivation. The framework is flexible, recognizes human feelings, and encourages intellectual growth. This advances English literature instruction greatly."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the myriad ways in which education, research, and innovation can be used to empower women in computing to help them deliver a sustainable digital future. Through a mixed-methods research design, which combines qualitative interviews, scientometric and bibliometric analyses, and comparative quantitative research, the research question explores the lived experiences, barriers, and opportunities of women in the fields of STEM, entrepreneurship, and technology. The methodology will be based on literature reviews and decision-making analyses to determine major drivers of digital empowerment especially in developing settings. Early indicators are that artificial intelligence and digital technologies offer significant positives in helping women to access education, health, and entrepreneurial opportunities particularly in underserved communities. Nevertheless, there still remain some challenges, including the gender digital divide, institutionalised biases, and deeply held gender roles, that limit the overall involvement of women in the world of technology. The paper highlights the effectiveness of interventions, such as gender-sensitive education, inclusive leadership and focused policy actions, to strengthen the independence of women, their competence, and leadership in ICT. In addition, the incorporation of sustainability and digitalisation into highereducation courses also empowers women in the digital economy. As a result, the empowerment of women in computing is seen as an innovation driver, economic, and the achievement of sustainable development objectives which leads to the need to implement comprehensive measures to address the current obstacles and make the digital world gender-neutral."

This study, to the best of our knowledge, lays the groundwork and systematically examines the feasibility of extracting image data from RAM dumps captured while the image viewing application remained active, despite the source USB storage device being disconnected. Memory dumps are investigated to identify how inmemory structures contribute to image retention. The results show that conventional file recovery approaches are ineffective due to application-specific image rendering mechanisms. Direct examination of a process’ memory regions allows recovery of the original compressed files. The findings propose a framework, using existing tools, for recovering images from memory in disconnected storage scenarios, advancing the field of memory forensics through a framework that adapts to Windows memory management behaviors."

This study investigates the potential of deep learning models, MobileNetV2 and CNN-LSTM, for image-based classification of these conditions. Publicly available datasets were collected, preprocessed, and expanded through augmentation to enhance robustness. Both models were trained and evaluated under multiple hyperparameter configurations. MobileNetV2 consistently achieved higher performance, with a reported peak test accuracy of 99.90%, compared to CNN-LSTM’s maximum of 92.08%. To assess clinical applicability, a prototype system was developed using Streamlit, enabling users to upload nail images for automated classification. Validation against a set of dermatologist-labeled clinical images yielded a real-world accuracy of 70%. This outcome highlights both the feasibility of AI-driven nail disease detection and the limitations of dataset size, diversity, and preparation protocols. Importantly, the analysis of misclassified images revealed challenges such as lighting variability, multiple nails in a single frame, and symptom overlap, underscoring the need for more representative datasets. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, it demonstrates the promise of lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 for nail disease detection; second, it presents a deployable prototype that bridges machine learning research with accessible healthcare applications. While the current accuracy is constrained by dataset limitations, this research provides a proof-of-concept foundation. Future work will adopt best-practice augmentation protocols, expand dataset diversity, and incorporate additional nail conditions to strengthen clinical robustness."

Early and objective detection is therefore critical for successful intervention. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides high-level information regarding brain activity and connectivity, allowing machine learning methods to draw out patterns associated with dyslexia. It evaluates deep learning approaches to dyslexia diagnosis from fMRI. In particular, it is processed with slice-wise 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using majority voting, projection- and montage-based 2D features, knowledge-distilled 2D CNNs supervised by 3D teacher models, direct 3D CNN baselines, and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) acting upon functional connectivity matrices. Experimental comparison highlights accuracy versus computational cost trade-offs. Results indicate that GCN models give the highest accuracy of 97.6% using connectivity-based features, whereas 2D CNN projection methods yield 93.2% accuracy with lower computational complexity. In comparison, straightforward 3D CNNs perform poorly at 89.3% accuracy. The results indicate the promise of 2D and graph-based models for practical and efficient fMRI-based dyslexia diagnosis."

The primary objective is to minimise production downtime by enabling hands-free operation in noisy industrial environments for people regardless of the clarity of their speech. The system architecture combines real-time speech processing with industrial control protocols, addressing key challenges such as acoustic interference from machinery vibrations and ambient noise. Experimental validation was conducted on a functional conveyor line, comparing the proposed solution against traditional control methods. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in downtime, with high speech recognition accuracy under typical factory noise conditions. The system’s robustness was tested across varying noise levels, dialects, and operator speech patterns, showing consistent performance in highvibration environments. Key innovations include adaptive noise filtering algorithms and vibration-resistant microphone placement strategies, which improved command detection reliability. Ergonomics assessments revealed a significant reduction in operator fatigue compared to manual controls. The study provides practical insights for implementing voice-driven automation in Industry $\\mathbf{4. 0}$ environments while also highlighting limitations in extreme noise scenarios."

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress research paper reports findings from introducing an eXplainable AI (XAI) component into AI education within two Finnish middle school classrooms. The educational intervention focused on image classification, a popular technique for introducing learners to supervised machine learning and data-driven thinking. A key moment during these interventions arises when the model does not work as expected: Learners must engage deeply in data-driven analysis to identify what in their data set might explain the unexpected behavior, collect additional data, or curate their dataset, re-train and test their model, and iterate accordingly. To support learners during the “evaluate your model behavior” phase of the ML workflow, we designed and integrated a class activation map (CAM)-based XAI component into our learning tool. This component provides learners with a heatmap-type visualization that highlights which areas of an image contribute the most to the classification result. We conducted classroom interventions with children aged 11 - 16 years, gathered written design diaries and video data, and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis. Our findings indicate that without explicit instruction on how the XAI component works and how to interpret the visualization, the learners found the component more confusing than explanatory. The study suggests future research directions for facilitating XAI-enhanced educational technology in classroom settings."

    "abstract": "This research paper examines how students utilize generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) both in and outside an introductory Statics and Mechanics of Materials course, utilizing an interactive online textbook hosted through Top Hat. The textbook features its own GenAI, called ACE, which is trained exclusively on course materials from the textbook. Researchers conducted, recorded, and transcribed six focus group interviews. Responses were analyzed into a report on each student's experience. Several key themes emerged from the focus groups, including both positive aspects, such as using ACE as a virtual tutor, and negative aspects, such as having ACE attempt to answer questions on their behalf. While this raised concerns regarding academic integrity, the responses showed that those who misused GenAI became aware of their wrongdoing and adjusted their usage to aid in learning. Students cited various reasons for changing negative habits, including developing an awareness of the potential harm of building a dependency, recognizing that GenAI was inferior to human interaction when seeking help, and being aware of AI's limitations in providing reliable knowledge. As a result, students recognized the need for in-person instruction to master a subject. The self-reported data suggests that when used appropriately, GenAI can enhance student comprehension of course material; however, when misused, it may hinder students' study habits and learning. Findings suggest that educators should consider implementing instruction on the ethical, practical, and effective use of GenAI as opposed to banning it. This multifaceted approach would minimize potential academic integrity violations while maximizing academic benefits."

An optimised PV system, together with battery storage and converter sizing, was designed using HOMER Pro software, taking into account the average energy demand of the community. Four alternatives—PV, diesel generator, PV+diesel, and PV+wind—were compared. Both solar and diesel options were cost-effective; however, we chose solar because it is significantly more environmentally friendly and does not produce operational pollution. The solar system is a reasonable, feasible, and environmentally friendly power supply for the community."

As a result, the unwanted modes and frequencies near the sideband may sneak into the system and lead to instability. Here, based on the four-ridge circular coupling-cavity structure (FCCS), we propose a wideband mode filtering converter (MFC) that can be regarded as an integration of an MC, a frequency filter, and a mode filter due to the high mode purity in the passband and out-of-band rejection characteristics, as well as the mode filtering performance. Furthermore, an X-band wideband TE<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub> to TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</sub> MFC was fabricated and tested.

While a growing body of research highlights the benefits of these approaches, there remain critical gaps in understanding their long-term effectiveness, implementation challenges, and alignment with industry needs. Engineering education has increasingly integrated cross-disciplinary learning models to prepare students for the complexities of modern engineering problems. However, questions persist regarding the sustainability of these programs, their measurable impact on career readiness, and how effectively they align with workforce demands. This paper conducts a scoping review of literature from leading databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate and ERIC, applying thematic analysis to identify common trends, unresolved issues, and opportunities for future research. Findings suggest that while these programs enhance student engagement, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, there is limited evidence of long-term career benefits and consistent industry alignment. Additionally, faculty preparedness, institutional support, and curriculum scalability are identified as key barriers to successful program implementation. This review highlights the need for structured assessment frameworks, enhanced industry partnerships, and long-term career impact studies to optimize the effectiveness and scalability of these educational models."

How can the CS teaching model adapt to introduce programming to as many students as possible with lower staffing requirements, while also maintaining learning objective achievement, improving retention rates, and providing adequate student support? We describe the design intentions, development, and implementation details of the course content, as well as the scalable support structures that enable the course population to grow to over 3000 students per semester. We also share how we approach issues of academic integrity, curriculum integration, data-driven content revision, and our staffing model. Evaluations demonstrate high student learning outcomes, improved retention, and consistent achievement in follow-up courses. Looking towards the future, we discuss areas of improvement for the model and how this might be adapted at other institutions."

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress study investigates how prerequisite courses affect student learning outcomes in ECE 301-Linear Systems, focusing on understanding students' perceived effectiveness of prerequisite content from ECE 220-Analytical Foundations of ECE and ECE 211-Electric Circuits. The course, ECE 200-Introduction to Signals, Circuits and Systems, is also of interest, since it is a prerequisite for both ECE 220 and ECE 211, and the concepts are directly linked with topics taught in ECE 301. The paper uses triangulation based on grade distribution data, student surveys, and faculty interviews to draw conclusions about the impact of each of the prerequisite courses. The survey was implemented in a class of ECE 301, toward the end of the semester. Students were asked if specific topics were necessary preparation or unnecessary repetition for ECE 301, specific to their section and offering of enrolled prerequisite classes. Interesting trends led to follow-up interviews with faculty, to ascertain their views on curriculum continuity and instructional strategies. Preliminary findings suggest certain repeated topics were more helpful than others, while certain topics taught in ECE 200 need not be repeated in ECE 220 in the students' perspective. For example, Periodic Signals in the Frequency domain was reported to be helpful for ECE 301 when taught in ECE 200, but students felt it did not need to be repeated in ECE 220. Faculty interviews also provided information on effective strategies that students found helpful. The overall aim of this work is to benefit students and faculty by proposing ideas for enhanced student learning."

    "abstract": "This WIP Research-to-practice study examines the ongoing initiative of the AIALA program which introduces graduate students to the topics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Arid Land Agriculture (ALA). The main objective of this work is to inform research to practice, with the purpose of contributing to innovative practices in computing education in the future. The program aims to equip fellows with skills needed to implement and develop new AI-driven technologies that address challenges in arid land agriculture. Since the program launched in Spring 2023, AIALA has recruited five fellows. The coursework includes topics in machine learning, ALA, ethics, and proposal development. These topics are complemented by faculty mentorship, research experiences, and professional development workshops. Three research questions guide the AIALA project: (1) To what extent do scholars gain competencies in AI and ALA? (2) How successful is the program in the recruitment and retention of scholars from diverse academic backgrounds, while fostering inclusivity in interdisciplinary research? (3) To what extent does the program prepare scholars with essential professional and soft skills such as teamwork, interdisciplinary communication, and ethics? We present preliminary findings from an evaluation of the AIALA program, focusing on student experiences and learning outcomes. Interviews and surveys were conducted with student participants to assess key programmatic aspects, including learning opportunities, financial benefits, networking, clear expectations, and overall support guidance. Findings indicate that while students value the opportunity to gain content knowledge, hands-on experience, and interdisciplinary perspectives, challenges exist in leveling the knowledge field across different disciplines. Participants noted increased confidence in discussing topics outside their primary field but highlighted the need for structured learning pathways, particularly for those with limited prior research experience. Program strengths include faculty support and networking opportunities, while suggested improvements emphasize practical skill development and adapting research training to the academic backgrounds of participants. A key challenge has been recruiting domestic doctoral students, leading to the inclusion of master's students, which introduced differences in research relevance and quality; addressing this will improve program accessibility while maintaining research standards. In conclusion, AIALA represents a potential training hub focused on the convergence of research themes in AI and ALA, fostering innovative and ethical solutions. Future efforts will incorporate more hands-on learning and refine strategies to bridge theory with real-world applications. This paper not only documents the preliminary findings but also underscores the transformative potential of collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to education."

    "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Paper presents a methodology that integrates prompt engineering of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the teaching of software project management in undergraduate education. Addressing the challenges of conveying complex and evolving project management practices, the approach combines the Project Management Institute (PMI) framework with Scrum and project-based learning (PBL), creating an adaptive learning environment supported by LLM-driven mentorship. During a 12 -week period, the student project team (squads) managed their own software projects, developing documentation aligned with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) performance domains. LLMs acted as virtual specialists, providing real-time guidance and filling expertise gaps typically addressed by domain specialists. Students engaged in six practical activities that culminated in a cross-validation task comparing results generated by different LLMs. The evaluation focused on the completeness and PMBOK compliance of the produced documentation, with LLM assessments moderated by the instructors. In addition, students applied prompt engineering strategies in a final exam to iteratively refine LLM responses to PMIstyle certification questions. The results align with recent research, emphasizing the role of prompt engineering in educational contexts, and illustrate how LLMs can foster responsive, industry-relevant learning environments. This methodology enhances decision-making skills, promotes hands-on experience with PMI and Scrum, and introduces students to emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. It also demonstrates scalability and potential for democratizing high-quality mentorship in resourceconstrained educational settings. The paper discusses the implementation, results, and limitations, offering insights for adapting the approach to other software engineering courses."

In response to the growing demand for skilled professionals and training in these fields, NOVA launched a suite of initiatives including the ET & DCO summer bridge program, ET Ready summer bridge program, Educator Externship, and the ET Career Scholars program. These programs at NOVA utilize hands-on activities and training, industry tours, campus visits, and targeted support to engage diverse stakeholders such as high school students, high school educators, NOVA administrators, and industry partners. Preliminary evaluation data reveal significant growth in the students' understanding of ET and DCO careers, with many participants enrolling in related ET and DCO programs at NOVA. High school educators also reported increased awareness of ET and DCO career pathways and committed to sharing this knowledge with students and the students' parents. The programs' shared structure minimizes planning efforts while enabling lessons learned to be applied across initiatives. This approach provides a replicable model for other institutions seeking to build awareness of emerging technologies and expand workforce pipelines for students. In addition to high school students and educators, we recommend engaging high school students' families-an essential stakeholder group not always included as partners-in outreach efforts to further support students' educational and career decisions. By fostering partnerships and addressing barriers to training and awareness, NOVA demonstrates how community colleges can play a pivotal role in preparing the next generation of professionals for the rapidly evolving ET and DCO industries."

Traditional PID tuning methods often lack adaptability and efficiency, especially under dynamic conditions. To overcome these limitations, a hybrid PSO algorithm combining Chaotic PSO, Orthogonal Learning PSO, Adaptive Inertia Weight, and Velocity Clamping, is proposed to improve the optimization process. Implemented on a DC motor position control system using Arduino and an encoder, the method effectively identified optimal PID parameters with K<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf>=1.04, K<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>=37.16, and K<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</inf>=0.001. The results show significant improvements, including a settling time of 0.441 s , a maximum overshoot of 0.8%, zero steady-state error, and a rise time of 0.189 s .

    "abstract": "Gas solubility prediction is foremost in the petroleum industry, affecting reservoir management, production optimization, and safety considerations. This study presents a comprehensive review of machine learning methods used in gas solubility prediction. These methods are Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Functional Network (FN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study explores machine learning methods, highlights their capability to predict gas solubility, and discussed some case studies to illustrate their accuracy in gas solubility prediction. The ANNs exhibit adaptability in handling clustered data. However, they are constrained by dependencies on hidden layer configurations. This study also delves into ANFIS, a hybrid model combining ANN learning capacities with fuzzy logic, showcasing its robust predictions for gas solubility. Studies underscore ANFIS's accuracy, especially in uncertain and complex systems, and its ability to overcome fitting challenges. ANFIS models have an Average Absolute Percentage Error (AAPRE) of (4.631-4.719) % for gas solubility prediction. FN emerges as an alternative to ANNs, leveraging domain knowledge alongside data for enhanced insights. The studies indicate FN's satisfactory performance in gas solubility prediction, particularly in estimating gas solubility (Rs) with acceptable error rates. FN models have an AAPRE of 10.2012% for gas solubility prediction. This review also discusses SVM, a supervised learning model effective in regression analysis for gas solubility prediction. The SVM has a lower over-fitting risk and convergence with global optima, especially in the modified versions such as LSSVM for large-scale problems. The SVM models have an AAPRE of 9.0757-15.94 % for gas solubility prediction. This review on the machine learning models in gas solubility prediction underscores their importance in optimizing oil production, enhancing safety measures, and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations in the oil and gas industry."

    "abstract": "The conceived Context-Aware Multi-Modal Traveler Preference Network (CMTN) is an intelligent system of improving the personal travel suggestions with the blending of multiple data types and context variables. Conventional destination recommendation systems have been known to be based on the use of fixed user profiles and historical information and thus cannot respond to the dynamic changing needs of the traveler and changes in the situation. The CMTN method will overcome this shortcoming by using behavioral, semantic, and environmental data in a single model of prediction. It is based on a two-channel architecture in which textual data, including reviews and social media, are fed through a semantic encoder based on transformers, whereas geospatial and temporal also have temporal convolutional networks. Such features representations are combined via cross-attention mechanism which gives less emphasis on irrelevant factors. Moreover, a reinforcement learning layer corrects predictions based on the feedback of the iterative nature to provide adaptability and continuous enhancements in the suggested accuracy. Besides suggesting the appropriate destinations, the proposed system is also able to match destinations with the changing interests and real-life situations that travelers have e.g., weather, events, and time limitations. It is anticipated that through experimental validation, CMTN will surpass the traditional machine learning models mainly due to its overwhelming precision, relevance and flexibility, thus providing a comprehensive and capable solution to the intelligent travel experience personalization."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the rural energy revolution and the advancement of the \"Dual Carbon\" goals, as the core carrier for rural distributed energy consumption and the guarantee of energy supply quality, the autonomous operation stability, smoothness of mode switching, and scheduling optimization of independent micro-energy grids under different conditions are directly related to the reliability of rural energy supply. This paper conducts research on key technologies targeting two core issues of rural independent micro-energy grids: transient impact after power grid faults and fluctuating islanding-grid connection switching. First, it analyzes the influencing mechanism of voltage-frequency transient response after microenergy grid faults. Second, it designs a smooth islanding-grid connection switching strategy based on droop control; through preset transition control and adaptive parameter adjustment, the voltage fluctuation during mode switching is controlled within ten percent to ensure the stable supply of various energy forms. The results effectively solve the problems of transient stability, mode switching, and scheduling optimization in the autonomous operation of rural independent micro-energy grids, provide technical support for improving the quality of rural energy supply and the local consumption of distributed energy, and contribute to the construction of smart energy systems in beautiful villages."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel multimodal quiz generation framework that integrates audio, visual, and textual data using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The system leverages LLaVA for vision-language understanding and LLaMA 3.1 for text generation to produce contextually relevant and pedagogically meaningful multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from lecture videos. This approach addresses key limitations of traditional text-only quiz generation models by capturing richer, multimodal information. The system was tested on a real-world use case, generating 15 MCQs from the first lecture in an introductory computer science course. To evaluate the effectiveness of the generated quizzes, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework. In the first stage, we assessed retrieval and generation performance using standard metrics such as Hit Rate, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Correctness, Relevance, and Faithfulness. In the second stage, we examined how closely AI evaluations align with human expert judgments. We involved four human raters and three LLM-as-Judge models—Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-4, and LLaMA 3.1—to evaluate each question. To analyze agreement, we used Percentage Agreement, Cohen's Kappa, Spearman's Rho, and Krippendorff's Alpha, capturing both exact matches and ordinal consistency. Our results show high retrieval accuracy and reasonable alignment between LLM based and human assessments, particularly in factual and procedural questions. However, discrepancies emerged in questions requiring deeper reasoning or visual interpretation, where human raters exhibited stronger consistency. These findings highlight the strengths of LLMs in scalable content generation, while reinforcing the need for human oversight in evaluating complex educational tasks. This work takes a significant step toward more human-aligned and effective AI-driven assessment systems."

In contrast to the previous research, the presented method framework will combine individual pre-processing steps and dataset-individual augmentation to maximize tumor position localization in multimodal imaging. The models are also trained and tested on a large dataset that consists of a detailed guaranteed that the models can detect tumors of different size and contrast. Results in experiments show that YOLOv8 has an accuracy higher than 89.3, which is higher than that of YOLOv7 (88.6), at better precision (0.87 vs. 0.85), recall (0.88 vs. 0.86), and shorter inference time (11.8 ms vs. 12.5 ms). The suggested solution saves the fields on the interactivity of GPU memory and the size of models, which enables their implementation into clinical settings. This study confirms that such optimized YOLO models have practical potential of developing tumors at an early phase, fast and precise performance that aims to transform tumor imaging diagnostics in oncological radiology."

Since financial time series data is both intricate and complex, the study offered a two-stage hybrid method for choosing important features. At the beginning, the method uses MFFS (Multi-Filter Feature Selection) to put together the rankings of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, ANOVA and Mutual Information to cut out irrelevant indicators. In the second stage, a wrapper-based LFCSO (Levy's Flight Chicken Swarm Optimization) algorithm is used to avoid stuck at local results and rapid convergence and optima the final set of features. Then, the well-defined list of features is given to deep learning models—LSTM, CNN and ConvLSTM—to make accurate predictions about stock prices. Checking on well-known datasets (S&P500, NASDAQ, RUSSELL2000) showed that the results are more accurate than before, as confirmed by the RMSE, MAE and MAPE tests. The introduced hybrid FS model has better accuracy and uses less computing power, compared to well-known optimization methods."

Here, we demonstrate a modified parameter-scaling rule which includes the capillary loss term, being useful to system design and optimization. We illustrate both theoretically and experimentally that this modified scaling rule is valid for all of the HSC, DWE and IBS processes, highlighting the similarities of these nonlinear propagation processes over a large range of capillary sizes.

    "abstract": "This full paper explores the interaction between varying levels of Need for Cognitive Closure (NFCC) and undergraduate engineering students' cognitive engagement. Engineering students inevitably encounter complex problems. Educational systems aim to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and attitude required to undertake such situations. To address this goal, there is a need to understand the learner's ability and willingness to deal with situations involving complex information. The psychological construct of the NFCC can influence one's cognitive processes associated with problem solving, such as motivation to simplify complex information and avoid ambiguity. High NFCC individuals tend to prefer shallow learning strategies while confronting complex problems, which can hinder deep understanding and engagement. Low NFCC individuals persist through complex tasks and consider alternative solutions that foster engagement and creativity. The relation between the need for closure and engagement during problem-solving needs further exploration in engineering despite the extensive research in psychology. This study investigates the impact of NFCC on cognitive engagement during problem-solving tasks. This mixed-method study will select participants with either high or low NFCC based on a validated need for cognitive closure scale (NFCCS) survey response during the quantitative phase, administered to engineering students. Then, participants were selected purposefully for the problem-solving activity and semistructured interviews in the qualitative phase. Data collection involves audio recordings of participants during problemsolving tasks, which were transcribed and analyzed using thematic coding to identify recurring patterns and themes related to cognitive engagement. This research seeks to provide insights into the cognitive processes that shape problem-solving behaviors, which could inform instructional practices in engineering based on individual differences."

Building upon a static model of z-surfaces and z-curves, this paper presents a dynamic model for migration of z-surfaces and z-curves with respect to satellite motions and atmospheric changes. Specifically, we use geometric transformation matrices and numerical solvers to describe the migration of the satellite Terrestrial Service Volume (TSV) model, z-surface, and z-curve. Affine transformations are applied to TSV and z-surface migrations, while for z-curve migration, we adopt a modified Newton’s method and a 4th-order Runge-Kutta method to align z-curve points on ground and within satellite coverage. These migration functions are validated using Global Positioning System (GPS) data."

    "abstract": "This research-to-practice full paper describes a study that investigates the relationship between mathematical skills and programming task performance among undergraduate computer science students. Learning to program involves complex cognitive activities and various skill sets, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and abstraction. An indicator of student success is often their ability to apply critical thinking, problem-solving, and logical reasoning, skills typically developed through mathematics courses. This study explores the relationship between mathematical problem-solving skills (Calculation, Interpretation, Representation, and Application) and undergraduate computer science students' ability to understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms, as well as solve programming problems in their second computer science course. While the current analysis is based on a limited sample, the goal is to establish early insights for a more comprehensive study that will extend to additional courses, sections, and student populations. These initial findings can serve as preliminary data to guide future research and curriculum development. The results indicate that Interpretation and Application skills are positively correlated with higher-level programming tasks, such as analyzing and designing solutions. However, Calculation and Representation skills showed no meaningful correlations with the computer science learning outcomes from this study. The findings of the Problem-Solving Perception Survey reveal that while students are generally confident in problem-solving, they are less confident in applying mathematical skills to programming. The high variability in responses and anxiety with unfamiliar tasks suggest a need for stronger integration of mathematical problem-solving and early support in programming instruction."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the tag values in the Gamma Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN) topology and its relationship with redundant paths. The Gamma network tag value is the difference between the source port number and the destination port number (input-output port number) of the network multiplied by the network size modulo. From the discussion, it is obtained that the number of Gamma network tag values of size N ranges from -(N-1) to (N-1). A Gamma network with a size of 16x16 has a tag value from -15 to 15. The tag value determines the number of redundant paths for each source-destination connection. The number of redundant paths in the Gamma network varies, depending on the tag value ẟ and is calculated using the Fibonacci series. The redundant representation pattern with tag value ẟ can be a routing tag connection (S, D) with a tag value of -(N-ẟ) and vice versa. Specifically, a tag value of zero only produces one redundant path. From the tests carried out using permutations, there is a connection (S, D) that fails when using the first routing tag, but the packet successfully arrives at the destination when using the second routing tag. This shows that redundant paths in the Gamma network can reroute packets through other paths to avoid blocking, thereby improving the network blocking probability."

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one. Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene: pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can balance the need for additional sensors or training data."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is defined by persistent social interaction and communication difficulties, along with limited interests, repetitive activities, and sensory processing differences. ASD individuals tend to have distinct patterns of recognizing, conveying, and reacting to emotions. This paper provides a comparative evaluation of two deep learning methods to facial emotion recognition in autistic children: an adapted DenseNet121 model and a new Hybrid Attention-based Explainable Network (HAXN). Tested on a challenging dataset of 833 facial images for six emotions with extreme class imbalance, our experiments show that although DenseNet121 attains greater overall accuracy (65.33% vs. 61.33%), HAXN exhibits better generalization (72.22% validation accuracy) and offers key model interpretability through built-in attention mechanisms. Both models perform well on the majority joy class (F1 > 0.86) but fail with minority emotions, especially fear (0% F1-score in HAXN). Main conclusions are: (1) traditional CNNs (e.g., DenseNet121) are the current champions on imbalanced emotion classification tasks, over attention-based variants; (2) attention mechanisms allow for clinically actionable model transparency; and (3) extreme class imbalance is still the main bottleneck for autismspecific emotion recognition. This work opens doors to assistive technologies that make trade-offs on accuracy and explainability, and underscores pressing requirements for future minority-class learning work."

    "abstract": "Managing a distributed, multimodal and multicriteria system of interconnected decision-making subsystems requires transparent communication rules. An example of such a system is the modern power grid, where, in addition to classic system power plants, there are many distributed renewable sources, active prosumers, energy storage, electric vehicles, supply virtualization services (virtual power plants, DSR, flexibility service) and forced demand (non-market redistribution of generation constraints) [1]. Currently, power grid management is implemented based on the physical power flow, as well as voltage and frequency control in key system nodes. Exceeding the critical parameters controlled by the security devices results in the immediate shutdown of the affected network node, which in extreme cases can lead to an imbalance between supply and demand, cascading shutdowns of network infrastructure elements, and total blackout. A number of mechanisms are used to balance the network, from planning the operation of controllable power sources, through demand prediction, to DSR and DSM mechanisms. In an era of increasing saturation of the power system with renewable and uncontrollable power sources, these solutions are proving insufficient, as was clearly demonstrated by the blackout in Spain and Portugal, where millions of people were deprived of access to power in practically 3 seconds [2]. Here, the currently applied price mechanism for balancing demand and supply (real-time prices) is too slow to counteract emergency disconnections.The article will present the methodological foundations of the FuzzyTR model and an example of its use in a beverage production company<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>This article is a part of the bigger research project no FENG.01.01-IP.01-A0AH/24-00, being cofounded by the National Centre for Research and Development in Poland.

The proposed algorithm leverages the capabilities of articulated robots and 3D camera technology to perform efficient and adaptive palletization. It addresses the significant challenge of accommodating diverse box dimensions through a dynamic, real-time algorithm, that utilizes data from a 3D camera to perceive the size and shape of each incoming box accurately. Subsequently, the robot employs a carefully optimized manipulation strategy to grasp and place boxes on the pallet in an optimal arrangement. The algorithm’s adaptability is emphasized as it continuously refines its palletizing strategy in response to the changing characteristics of incoming boxes. Experimental results emphasize the algorithm’s efficacy, demonstrating an average pallet space utilization between 75.63% and 82.88% for common pallet sizes, with a peak efficiency reaching 92.77%. This research contributes to the evolving field of robotics and automation, offering a versatile solution for palletizing tasks where the box dimensions can vary significantly."

    "abstract": "Understanding the Earth's surface structure is critical for many geospatial processes, yet acquiring proper elevation data remains challenging. Surface elevation estimation from 2D orthomosaic is especially difficult because 2D orthomosaic lacks height information. To deal with this, a Deep learning (DL) based model is developed that predicts Digital Surface Model (DSM) directly from high- resolution orthomosaic. A modified U-Net architecture with residual and dilated convolutional blocks is used to learn the spatial link between visual surface attributes and elevation. The model is trained with drone imagery and corresponding DSM obtained by photogrammetric processing. As the model follows a regression-based approach, a single fixed accuracy value cannot be defined, so when tested on multiple unseen patches, the model achieved an average RMSE of approximately 4–5 meters and an overall accuracy of about 78–80%, demonstrating its reliability and consistency in generating DSM outputs that closely align with ground truth elevation data."

    "abstract": "Ensuring the security of future network infrastructures, which include 5G/6G, Internet of Things (IoT) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), requires precise identification and detection of malicious/malware families. Although current malware identification methods achieve high accuracy, their validation is largly confined to a narrow range of malware families/samples. Analyses often prioritise families with abundant samples, introducing potential bias and limiting representativeness in classification results. This leads to unreliable detection in real-world heterogeneous network environments. This study addresses the gap by improving malware identification accuracy and robustness through an analysis of dataset size, and class balance, the effect of temporal data augmentation on classifier performance. The study demonstrates that maintaining balanced sample sizes across various malware families significantly improves classifier accuracy by mitigating bias towards majority classes. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art classifiers and two augmentation techniques, Synthetic Data Vault and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, to enhance the malware classification, particularly in vulnerable enviornments such as edge networks, ITS and IoT."

Concomitantly, the same proliferation has rendered attached ecosystems susceptible to increasingly refined cyber attacks. Given the generally open and frequently unregulated characteristics of contemporary IoT networks, surface and attack vectors for malware propagation have widened. In response, this article presents an innovative framework anchored in behavioral analysis and tailors it specifically for the identification of IoT malware within dense metropolitan environments. By assimilating state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies, the framework isolates behavioral anomalies typically consistent with malware interference, thus accommodating the heterogeneous and transitory nature of IoT deployments. Structured around continuous data capture and analytical interrogation, the framework accentuates engineered attributes designed to mirror deviations in operational patterns and in associated network performance variables. Through the supervised application of classification algorithms, the framework achieves pronounced accuracy and operational stability for hostile-traffic scenarios. Conclusive experiments, executed on rigorously standardized datasets, substantiate the framework in discerning legitimate operational baselines from tactical breaches across a spectrum of IoT paradigms. The present inquiry, therefore, not only fortifies the cyber-defensive posture of metropolitan environments but also undergirds a more secure, dependable foundational architecture for communal IoT networks."

By conducting a between-subjects experiment with 36 HR professionals, this research compares AI-assisted hiring decisions to traditional, intuition-based methods. Participants were assigned to one of two groups: Group A, which used AI-generated insights to evaluate candidates, and Group B, which relied on resumes and qualitative feedback. The findings reveal that AI-enhanced decision-making significantly improved decision accuracy and efficiency, with Group A achieving higher alignment with expert benchmarks and making faster decisions than Group B. Qualitative interviews highlighted five critical themes: decision quality, fairness, data bias, trust, and cultural consideration. Some are reluctant to fully rely on AI due to its perceived lack of human judgment, which also influences decision-making, suggesting that AI adoption must consider local organizational values. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on AI in HR by emphasizing the importance of human-AI collaboration and providing practical insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI into HR practices."

    "abstract": "A segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed, in which a segmented waveguide composed of multiple short dielectric waveguide segments is employed to radiate or receive signals through the pinching antennas (PAs) deployed on each segment. Based on this architecture, three practical operating protocols are proposed: segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM). For uplink SWAN communications, where one PA is activated per segment, the segmented structure eliminates the inter-antenna radiation effect, i.e., signals captured by one PA may re-radiate through other PAs along the same waveguide. This yields a tractable and physically consistent uplink signal model for a multi-PA pinching-antenna system (PASS), which has not been established for conventional PASS using a single long waveguide. Building on this model, PA placement algorithms are proposed to maximize the uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Closed-form expressions for the received SNR under the three protocols are derived, and the corresponding scaling laws with respect to the number of segments are analyzed. It is proven that the segmented architecture reduces both the average PA-to-user distance and the PA-to-feed distance, thereby mitigating both large-scale path loss and in-waveguide propagation loss. These results are extended to downlink SWAN communications, where multiple PAs are activated per segment, and PA placement methods are proposed to maximize the downlink received SNR under the three protocols. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) among the three protocols, SM achieves the best performance, followed by SA and then SS; and ii) for all protocols, the proposed SWAN achieves a higher SNR than conventional PASS with a single long waveguide in both uplink and downlink scenarios."

The obtained performance of the model is compared with a range between predicted and true value under the circumstances where the temperature is changing. With multiple iterations, RMSE of 0.025 is achieved for the model, again demonstrating better performance than previous models which started to get higher RMSE values. They also tested the performance in extreme temperatures $\\left(-10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right.$ and $\\left.25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. The research also proposes a new approach of pruning and projecting that eliminates the combinatorial complexity and keeps the quality of the model. Residuals analysis shows consistent and stable residuals which validate the model and improve their robustness. A confusion matrix analysis in full detail shows the strong holding position of the model on classification with good predictions outside of distribution (OOD) and in-distribution (ID).

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of industrial systems demands a transition from passive monitoring to proactive decision support, a shift that hinges on advanced intelligent perception. However, most systems remain confined to brittle, rule-based logic, which operates on fixed symptom-to-action mappings and thus cannot perceive the underlying, context-dependent operational intent. This perceptual gap is particularly detrimental especially in fault diagnosis, where this inability to adapt leads to frequent misdiagnoses and costly downtime. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the Intent-Aware Enhancement Framework (IAEF)<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>, which replaces static rules by actively creating and reasoning over a dynamic causal model. This is achieved through two core method. The Information Theory-guided Causal Graph Revision (ITCGR) algorithm provides the foundation by constructing a reliable causal model, uniquely leveraging information-theoretic metrics to guide an LLM for verifiable revisions on sparse data. Building on this model, the Multi-scale Adaptive Path Reasoning (MAPR) method then infers the true operational intent, employing a novel adaptive fusion model to robustly navigate complex inference chains. Experimental validation in a real-world case demonstrates the framework’s ability to accurately diagnose fault root causes under varying conditions, a task where traditional systems fail. The proposed approach significantly outperforms baselines, providing a foundational methodology for advancing industrial intelligence."

A K-type thermocouple was dynamically calibrated to validate the proposed method. The innovation of this framework lies not only in obtaining the optimal dynamic model but, more importantly, in the systematic propagation of the statistical uncertainty of the model coefficients to the sensor’s frequency-domain characteristics, which enables the quantification of confidence intervals for the dynamic response. Furthermore, the impact of frequency-domain uncertainty on time-domain waveform reconstruction fidelity was analyzed, and based on this, the usable dynamic bandwidth of the sensor was defined. This approach provides a comprehensive analysis tool for evaluating the dynamic performance and reliable application of thermocouples."

The study examines the frequency of feedback types, delivery preferences, current practices, and student engagement and interest in feedback. A mixed methods approach was used with 340 participants (students: 186 KSA, 67 UK; academics: 72 KSA, 15 UK), using questionnaires available in both English and Arabic. The results indicate that summative feedback is the most common, with a general preference for electronic textual formats. KSA feedback was viewed as more encouraging, while the UK feedback emphasized clarity and alignment with the assessment criteria. However, detailed feedback was often lacking. Mann-Whitney <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$U$</tex> tests revealed significant differences <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(p&lt;0.05)$</tex> in perceived current practices and engagement. KSA instructors rated their practices more positively than the UK instructors and their students. Additionally, students and instructors in both regions differed in how they perceived student engagement with feedback. Qualitative analysis identified four key challenges: feedback quality, communication barriers, fairness concerns, and time constraints. These findings underscore the role of cultural and institutional contexts and point to the need for inclusive and improvement-oriented feedback systems. The study also offers pedagogical insights to support a more effective feedback design in CS education."

Student engagement, particularly in online courses, is often viewed as a challenge. To address this problem, we introduced two team-based learning assignments - a literature review and a final project - in two online graduate-level master's courses. Both these assignments were designed to enhance agentic, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement in students by addressing the three universal human needs in self-determination theory - autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Further, it was envisaged that these activities would benefit students through collaborative learning, peer learning, and improved emotional and psychological well-being. The design of our team-based learning activities also focused on open inquiry, the highest level of inquiry-based learning. For each of these activities, the student teams proposed their research question, reviewed relevant literature, performed relevant experiments as needed, and prepared a report detailing their findings and comparative evaluations of methods and models. We measured the effect of these activities on student engagement through feedback collected from the students using a student engagement questionnaire adapted for the structure of our online learning courses. Survey results and instructor experiences show a marked improvement in student engagement across all the different aspects of engagement."

    "abstract": "Social media platforms generate massive amounts of unstructured data which provide valuable insights into public sentiments in crisis situations. While previous research has demonstrated its value for either sentiment analysis or topic detection, there are still ways to utilize this data by combining these approaches. This study aims to build upon this by integrating aspect-sentiment analysis to capture more detailed and nuanced views often overlooked in disaster contexts. A dataset of 4,506 tweets collected from July 2023 to March 2025 were analyzed with a fine-tuned indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1 model and was able to categorize tweets into different topics and sentiments, uncovering sentiment patterns such as negative sentiments towards response efforts indicating public dissatisfaction or issues with aid. The aspect classifier achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.73, while the sentiment model reached 0.81 F1-score. This comprehensive approach provides deep insights into the public perception of various topics which can enable authorities to better understand public needs and concerns."

    "abstract": "This Paper examines novel approach the advancements in Q-dots based quantum radar technology, design considerations for its integration, and quantum radar cross section (QRCS) based on interferometric and quantum electrodynamics. In addition to performing standard target detection and recognition duties, quantum radar systems with quantum measurement assistance may also detect and identify RF stealth platforms and missile systems. In numerous fields of study, the advancement of radar technology is crucial. A quantum radar is a notion that has been developed that uses photon quantum states to gather information about a distant target. A single photon or a small group of photons is directed in the direction of the target. The target absorbs the photons, which are then re-emitted into the receiver. There are two possible approaches to carrying out the measurement procedure. An interferometric analysis can be performed.one can either count the number of photons that return or perform a measurement (or phase measurement) on the photon. Since the latter technique is called Quantum Illumination, the former is called Interferometric Quantum Radar. Entangled states or stationary quantum states of photons can be used for either of those techniques. Entangled states have been demonstrated to offer the best resolution enhancement, reaching the optimum situation. Compared to classical approaches, the advantage of adopting quantum states is that they show more degrees of correlation via which information can be obtained. These additional correlations, sometimes referred to as quantum correlations, increase the radar system's potential resolution and signal/noise ratio (SNR). Relationship research between the two photons is conducted in order to gather data. Coherent state quantum radar relies on coherent state photons and a quantum detection technique to overcome the diffraction limit. The design and operating concepts of quantum applied trends are also reviewed in this work."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This work-in-progress research paper focuses on algorithmic thinking and GenAI use for programming within a first-year engineering course. In introductory programming courses, students may use GenAI to generate correct solutions without fully engaging in the assignments, thus circumventing the learning process. But students may also engage with GenAI in ways that improve their algorithmic thinking ability. Research is needed to understand whether and how GenAI can be integrated to improve first-year engineering students' programming skills. A necessary first step in this direction is establishing relevant competencies and assessments. In Fall 2024, students in an introductory engineering course at Virginia Tech were permitted to use GenAI within fair use conditions. At the end of the semester, students responded to two instruments: 1) an anonymous survey asking whether and how they used GenAI to submit assignments during the programming unit of the course, and 2) a simplified version of an existing algorithmic thinking instrument. Preliminary findings indicate that around 70% of students reported using GenAI to assist with programming assignments without explicit guidance, though over 80% characterized this use as occasional. More than 75% of students reported using GenAI primarily for syntax assistance. The algorithmic thinking results suggest substantial variability in skill level across students, regardless of their self-reported programming experience. This study suggests that algorithmic thinking, as measured by an abbreviated scale in introductory programming courses, may not correlate with other desirable programming outcomes, like assignment performance, and additional measures may be needed to evaluate the impact of GenAI."

    "abstract": "In cloud analytics applications, $(k, n)$ threshold secret sharing as an important technique in secure multi-party computation, allows a group of participants to compute without revealing their information. While traditional $(k, n)$ threshold secret sharing multiplication sub-protocols are often accompanied by a large number of interactions and communications, which greatly increases their runtime in multiparty secure computation. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer ($k, n$) threshold secret sharing scheme based on access tree structure, which not only realizes the ($k, n$) threshold secret sharing multiplication subprotocol without interaction, but also realizes the multi-layer joint computation of secret values. We clearly evaluate our method in terms of computation, communication, and number of rounds. The results show that our experimental results outperform the existing secret sharing schemes. This is important for operations such as exponential functions that are commonly used in domains including deep learning."

    "abstract": "Rising demands in the vehicular technology highly impact the safety measurement and comfort of the driver systems. The Advanced Driver Assistance System is one of the intelligent technologies that considers various sensor information from both internal and external scenarios of the vehicle to make an accurate safety decision. As multiple sensors are involved in ADAS, it is essential to have a unified representation of all the sensed data, prioritising the sensor that provides the highest correlating information for that particular scenario. Based on this objective, this paper proposes a Bayesian network-based attention mechanism for ADAS in the vehicular scenario. The Bayesian network effectively obtains the posterior probability of the feature based on probabilities from the multimodal sensors. Using these probabilities, the attention weights are provided that capture the sensor with highly correlated data. Based on this fusion, the proposed work exhibits an 8% minor deviation due to overestimation when evaluated using the KITTI dataset."

    "abstract": "Multiple Peg-in-Hole (MPiH) assembly is one of the fundamental tasks in robotic assembly. In the MPiH tasks for large-size parts, it is challenging for a single manipulator to simultaneously align multiple distant pegs and holes, necessitating tightly coupled multi-manipulator systems. For such MPiH tasks using tightly coupled multiple manipulators, we propose a collaborative visual servo control framework that uses only the monocular in-hand cameras of each manipulator to reduce positioning errors. Initially, we train a state classification neural network and a positioning neural network. The former divides the states of the peg and hole in the image into three categories: obscured, separated, and overlapped, while the latter determines the position of the peg and hole in the image. Based on these findings, we propose a method to integrate the visual features of multiple manipulators using virtual forces, which can naturally combine with the cooperative controller of the multi-manipulator system. To generalize our approach to holes of different appearances, we varied the appearance of the holes during the dataset generation process. The results confirm that by considering the appearance of the holes, classification accuracy and positioning precision can be improved. Finally, the results show that our method achieves 100% success rate in dual-manipulator dual peg-in-hole tasks with a clearance of 0.2 mm, while robust to camera calibration errors."

Subsequently, XGBoost is employed to identify and filter important features, eliminating ineffective and redundant ones to enhance model accuracy. Finally, an ensemble learning strategy combining FCNN, XGBoost, and RF is proposed for electricity revenue prediction. Comparative and ablation experiments were conducted to evaluate the model.

As consumers’ expectations for timely delivery of home appliance products continue to rise, there is an urgent need to enhance the efficiency of logistics warehousing operations and the timeliness of outbound delivery. This study addresses bottleneck issues such as redundant picking paths and equipment collaborative scheduling conflicts in regional distribution centers of the home appliance industry. By integrating theories of intelligent manufacturing and smart logistics, a collaborative optimization framework that combines bi-level integer programming and simulation verification is proposed. Firstly, a bi-level integer programming model that integrates dynamic slot allocation, equipment collaborative scheduling, and path optimization is constructed. Furthermore, combined with discrete event simulation technology, system performance under different order sizes and working conditions is simulated and analyzed. Experimental results show that both on-time delivery rate and order processing efficiency have been improved. This research provides theoretical support and practical solutions for the efficient, low-cost, and robust operation of intelligent warehousing systems."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an innovative Energy-Efficiency-Aware Fixed-Time (EEAFT) control strategy for distributed permanent-magnet synchronous motor systems. The primary contribution is achieving rapid, precise speed consensus while effectively balancing energy consumption against consensus error, a challenge often overlooked in fixed-time (FxT) control designs. A key novelty lies in the introduction of a real-time reward mechanism, uniquely derived from low-pass filtering both the system's consensus error and the control input signals. This adaptive reward function dynamically adjusts the upper bound on convergence time. When the convergence time becomes excessively stringent, a substantial increase in control effort is required. This can lead to energy spikes and hardware overload. To mitigate these risks, the bound on convergence time is then relaxed. Conversely, when large consensus errors necessitate an accelerated response, the bound on convergence time is tightened to expedite error correction. To enhance robustness against unmodeled friction, winding losses, and external disturbances, a fuzzy logic system is employed to approximate unknown nonlinear dynamics, while a disturbance observer compensates for residual errors. Rigorous theoretical analysis confirms the boundedness of all system signals and guarantees FxT convergence under the proposed EEAFT framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the EEAFT-based controller, showcasing high-precision speed synchronization across multiple motors and achieving an improved trade-off between rapid transient response and overall energy efficiency."

    "abstract": "This research WIP paper explores the integration of ethics instruction in an undergraduate engineering course. Engineering students must cultivate ethical responsibility because engineering work affects societies, economies, and technological progress. However, engineering students may have limited opportunity to cultivate ethical responsibility for their future engineering practice because ethics instruction is often not well integrated within the engineering curriculum. Ethics instruction was implemented through problem-based learning (PBL) strategies to foster engineering students' ethical judgement development during complex problem solving. This study took place in a junior-level environmental engineering course at a Midwestern university in the United States. Twenty-one undergraduate students participated in the study. Ethics instruction was delivered in four modules - each entailing lectures, team (in-class) and individual (homework) ethical problem-solving activities. Students submitted work and their responses to a survey on team interaction were collected after each team activity. The students' work was analyzed using deductive content analysis informed by the Systems Thinking Framework. Analysis of the team interaction survey was guided by the Social Constructivism Model of Ethical Decision Making and supplemented with statistical analysis. Anticipated findings will include emergent themes from a holistic analysis of students' work and insights into students' perceptions of team interactions during class activities, both at the team and class levels. These findings may offer engineering instructors research-informed guidance for embedding ethics instruction into engineering courses, with the goal of preparing professionals equipped with sound ethical judgment skills for industry and society."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has ushered in an era of unprecedented data generation and automation. However, this interconnectivity introduces profound security and privacy challenges, particularly concerning the centralized aggregation of sensitive data for machine learning model training. Traditional cloud-centric approaches are vulnerable to single points of failure, data breaches, and privacy infringements. This paper investigates the synergistic integration of two transformative technologies-Blockchain and Federated Learning (FL)-as a robust framework to address these critical shortcomings. Federated Learning enables the collaborative training of machine learning models across distributed devices without centralizing raw data, thereby preserving data locality and privacy. Blockchain technology complements this by providing a decentralized, immutable, and transparent ledger to orchestrate the FL process securely. It facilitates trustworthy model aggregation, verifiable participant contribution, and resilient consensus mechanisms, mitigating risks such as model poisoning and malicious node attacks. The integration establishes a verifiable and auditable trail for all transactions within the FL lifecycle, from participant selection to global model updates. This research delineates the architectural principles of this integration, analyzes its efficacy in enhancing security and privacy for IoT and CPS, and discusses prevailing challenges and future research trajectories aimed at realizing a secure and trustworthy intelligent infrastructure."

Our goal is not to develop optimal discovery time solutions but instead to gain an understanding of scanning strategies that result in misalignments between the transmitter and receiver nodes, resulting in unbounded delays in neighbor discovery time. In one instance, we derive a simple analytical formula for a deterministic, heterogenous antenna scanning strategy whose result are incorrectly reported in the literature. Using this result, a wellknown scanning strategy for neighbor discovery, characterized by its energy conserving property, is extended to encompass a mixture of neighbor nodes with heterogenous numbers of directional antennas."

Supported by channel weighting, residual connections, and global skip links, the approach effectively improves reconstruction accuracy and spectral consistency.

    "abstract": "Despite extensive investigations into the multi-user haptic-enabled robotic system (M-Hers), achieving scalable control design in the presence of non-passive human operators remains a key challenge. This is primarily due to the increasing complexity of stability conditions and interaction coupling as the number of operators grows. In this study, we address this challenge in two steps. First, we introduce the individual interaction environment (IIE) to isolate the passivity violations, which facilitates the independent control design for each human-robot subsystem, thereby enhancing the scalability with respect to the number of subsystems. Second, within the IIE framework, we identify passivity-violating components caused by partners' active behaviors and propose a novel augmented tank-based controller (ATBC) to guarantee passive IIE while maintaining high rendering accuracy. Specifically, the ATBC employs an energy-related power regulation strategy to enhance interaction safety and a time-varying control gain to mitigate the negative effects of power regulation on rendering fidelity. We validated the proposed method through collaborative haptic tasks on a customized M-Hers composed of three robots in four different scenarios. Comparative studies demonstrate that our approach effectively ensures IIE passivity in the presence of active human behaviors, while ensuring high reproducibility and achieving a favorable balance between passivity and rendering accuracy."

    "abstract": "Communication barriers between deaf individuals and non-signers represent a significant accessibility challenge, with over 430 million people worldwide relying on sign language as their primary communication method. Existing automated sign language recognition systems often lack practical real-world deployment capabilities, focusing primarily on controlled dataset performance rather than operational usability in everyday environments. We developed a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter utilizing EfficientNetV2S with transfer learning for static hand gesture classification. The system processes live webcam input through a Streamlit-based interface featuring dual text feedback for prediction validation. Training employed the ASL Alphabet Dataset containing 28 gesture classes, with standard 80/20 train-validation splitting across 10 epochs. We conducted systematic evaluation across three critical deployment variables: camera orientation angles, background clutter levels, and skin tone variations to assess real-world robustness. The model achieved over 90% accuracy in controlled real-time scenarios with minimal skin tone sensitivity, demonstrating shape-based feature learning rather than color dependency. However, performance degraded significantly with camera side angles (20% accuracy drop) due to gesture distortion, and high background clutter required 6 to 12 prediction attempts versus 1 to 2 attempts in clean environments. The webcam-based interface with transparent prediction feedback demonstrates promising accessibility potential, though deployment requires controlled environments with frontal camera positioning and minimal background interference."

    "abstract": "Getting to grips with a ‘real’ measuring device is often intuitive via a user interface. This access is missing with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based synthetic instrument (SI) which is deeply embedded inside an FPGA chip. While software-implemented synthetic instruments may be easy to embed in a software environment, the test engineer may find it difficult to deal with FPGA tools. This poses a challenge for the integration of an SI as thirdparty Intellectual Property (IP) as well as for one that is under development in-house. Test engineers are often familiar with scripting languages such as Python. A Python environment provides a variety of tools and methods for evaluating measurement data. To bridge the gap between the Python world and FPGA-based SI, we propose a testbed based on a Zynq device from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). There, the Python environment runs on a processor core and can load SI configurations into the FPGA fabric, execute them there, and subsequently communicate with the instrument. This approach is supported by AMD’s “Python Productivity for Zynq” (PYNQ) environment. The solution described here is related to the publicly funded research program OpenCPTS<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>|, which establishes an open-software/open-hardware community for FPGA-based lowcost test systems.

    "abstract": "The use of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) is an emerging concept in transportation systems, where the platoon leader processes various types of information from followers and roadside units to make accurate decisions. However, in complex network environments, the leader election process can become complicated and inefficient due to potential network attacks and abnormal node behaviours. To address this challenge, this paper presents a leader vehicle election mechanism based on dynamic trust assessment within a zero-trust framework. The proposed mechanism comprises two key components: dynamic trust assessment and adaptive leader election. The dynamic trust assessment method involves a trust evaluation mechanism composed of direct trust assessment and recommendation trust assessment based on the state information of vehicle nodes, where the dynamic trust assessment results are adjusted according to node behaviour information. The leader election mechanism involves periodic elections among the vehicle nodes on the basis of the results of the dynamic trust assessment, in which the vehicle node with the most votes is selected as the leader. Through comparative experiments against a full trust scenario, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance in resisting network attacks and identifying abnormal nodes, thereby significantly improving the safety, stability, and operational efficiency of the vehicle platoon."

In contrast to traditional FPGA-based approaches, which typically rely on a fixed dataflow, the GPLP offers a reconfigurable, processor-like environment that can be programmed for various design configurations. This paper defines essential atomic operations required for QC-LDPC decoding and proposes the GPLP architecture supporting those operations with vector-based processing. The proposed GPLP significantly enhances simulation speed, providing a performance improvement of 220x to 574x over CPU-based simulations. The platform provides a unique combination of simulation speed, flexibility, and reconfigurability, making it an invaluable tool to rapidly evaluate and optimize LDPC decoding performance."

Considering the importance of personalized features related to the speaker in speech for source recovery and understanding, we propose a semantic-driven framework for personalized speech transmission, named PerSemCom, which combines speaker acoustic features with semantic information. Specifically, we first introduce an efficient semantic extraction mechanism to achieve the conversion from speech to text transcriptions, and design a semantic corrector coupled with multi-domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of wireless channel distortion. Building upon the reliable transcriptions at receiver, we further establish a speaker embedding vector knowledge base and achieve high-fidelity speech reconstruction through quantitative modeling of speaker-specific acoustic features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing schemes in terms of subjective perception at harsh channel conditions. Complexity analysis and latency measurements also show competitive advantages in computational efficiency and real-time capabilities. Reconstructed personalized speech samples have been publicly available at https://kwtankw.github.io/PerSemCom/."

However, the microgravity environment (∼10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−5</sup>g) presents significant challenges, particularly for landing. Accurate prelaunch testing of mechanical and control systems is crucial to ensure mission success. Therefore, the ground-based microgravity physical simulation is essential, particularly for accurately replicating its microgravity collision response. However, existing microgravity simulations fail to accurately replicate landing collision response, particularly in the vertical direction. In this article, an air-bearing simulation system with quasi-passive vertical compensation is presented, enabling 6-DOF simulation. The vertical compensation integrates a quasi-zero stiffness unit for passive gravity compensation, complemented by an active following mechanism for extended compensation stroke. The controller is specifically adjusted to generate the vertical virtual mass, ensuring equal added mass in all three directions and eliminating systematic errors. Vertical tests confirm that the system effectively simulates free-floating conditions for the lander simulator up to 1 ton and accurately responds to forces as small as 1 N. The proposed 6-DOF physical simulation system provides a novel technical approach and has been implemented in the ground verification of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Tianwen-2</i> exploration mission."

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics technologies carry out advanced sequencing analysis of molecular profiles with a spatial context, providing multi-source information essential for elucidating biological regulatory mechanisms. Nonetheless, it poses challenges in the integration of raw spatial coordinates with high-dimensional gene expression profiles in their native feature space. While spatial-aware methods effectively aggregate molecular information from local spatial neighborhoods, they fail to explore the long-range relationships associated with gene expression data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach termed GraphSTAR that encodes both spatial and gene expression data into undirected graphs, characterizing the local spatial proximity and global transcriptional similarity, respectively. Through a graph aggregation process, GraphSTAR integrates these diverse data sources within a joint graph structure, effectively modeling both local neighborhood relationships and long-range functional associations. Subsequently, a reassembled graph neural network is established by incorporating the graph aggregation into the feed-forward propagation using proximal operators, progressively refining spatial-informed latent representation to decipher spatial expression patterns of genes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphSTAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both spatial domain identification and cell-type annotation tasks."

The code-writing capabilities of GenAI technology can potentially help introductory engineering students with programming. However, the limitations of GenAI, especially its tendency to produce hallucinations, might confuse and/or overwhelm novice programmers. Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared student performance on a final programming project from two consecutive years: one without GenAI support (2022) and one with a guided GenAI integration (2023). The assignment was such that GenAI tools were not likely to complete it correctly solely from the written instructions, and thus students were required to think critically about both programming and GenAI to develop a successful program. Student-submitted programs were evaluated in terms of program accuracy, communication, and functionality using a scoring rubric. It was anticipated that GenAI would improve program functionality, but unknown whether it would have the same positive impact on accuracy and communication based on its limitations. Results revealed a significant overall improvement in programming outcomes from 2022 to 2023, with significantly higher scores for accuracy and communication observed for the with-GenAI group than the without-GenAI group. Functionality scores remained consistently high (at ceiling). These findings suggest that a guided GenAI integration can enhance novice student programming outcomes despite its limitations. GenAI tools are expected to become increasingly valuable for introductory engineering programming instruction and for programming as a field."

An attack simulation module is then introduced to enhance the decoder's robustness against various distortions. Additionally, an adversarial discriminator is incorporated to guide the encoder in optimizing the embedding strategy, thereby minimizing geometric distortion. Furthermore, a cross-resolution strategy is developed to enable training on low-resolution meshes and perform watermark embedding and extraction on high-resolution meshes.

Manual grading is becoming increasingly unsustainable due to growing student enrollment and the demand for timely, high-quality feedback. To address these challenges, this study explores the use of automated grading tools to reduce instructors' workload and improve scalability. The proposed autograder takes a “reverse-engineering” approach, i.e., it converts student code into structured natural language summaries, which are then compared against predefined grading rubrics. An evaluation is performed using an external dataset (the Menagerie dataset), which contains real student submissions graded by four human graders. The objective is to assess the alignment between grades assigned by the autograder and those assigned by human graders. Findings indicate that the autograder closely matches human grading when letter grades are considered, though it performs less accurately with fine-grained numerical scores. While not yet a complete substitute for human assessment, the autograder shows strong potential as a scalable, efficient tool for supporting grading in programming education."

Our approach preprocesses raw ECG signals and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction. Using the PTB-XL+ dataset, our model shows high correlation with ground truth features, effectively capturing global and leadspecific ECG characteristics. We demonstrate that a single lead (Lead II) performs comparably to all $\\mathbf{1 2}$ leads, reducing computational complexity. Additionally, a lower sampling frequency (100 Hz) maintains performance, offering an efficient alternative to 500 Hz.

    "abstract": "A novel approach to secure data transmission, quantum communication draws on fundamental principles of quantum physics. It ensures that the transmitted information is private and accurate. To provide security, quantum networks implement physical constraints such as the no-cloning rule and quantum entanglement. In contrast, computational complexity is employed by classical networks. However, with the proliferation of multiuser quantum networks, identity verification has become more challenging. People with malicious intentions might easily disrupt services in long-distance quantum networks by impersonating legitimate nodes and sharing entangled resources and quantum channels. This highlights the absolute necessity of secure authentication systems tailored to quantum environments. Enhancements to recent quantum authentication systems have been made utilizing techniques that are resistant to quantum computing. Researchers are looking into quantum digital signatures, entanglement-assisted protocols, and quantum key distribution (QKD) authentication to make multi-party communications more secure. In order to prevent attacks where a user establishes a fraudulent identity or account, these strategies can be applied to quantum networks. This study takes a look at current quantum authentication systems and gives them the once-over, focusing on how well they could handle multiple users. The article delves into the evolution of authentication systems to accommodate the distributed model, where nodes can function as senders, receivers, or relays. We aim to strike a compromise between practicality and security in our lightweight, low-latency protocols. Additionally, the paper discusses quantum-specific issues, such as side-channel attacks and device malfunctions, and how authentication techniques can help prevent them. Finally, this study demonstrates that authentication is the critical component of secure quantum communication for multiple users. The most secure quantum key distribution methods are still vulnerable to attacks from inside or outside the system if proper authentication is not in place."

    "abstract": "Technological advancements in cellular networks have enabled to surpass many challenges in telecommunications, but some features remain restricted, such as throughput, packet loss, and latency. User equipment (UE), including mobile, smart devices, vehicles, IoT devices, and smart city infrastructure, requires seamless connectivity to share data and resources effectively. Multiple radio access technology (multi-RAT) scenarios offer a solution to the limitations of individual RATs by combining their strengths. Determining the optimal RAT for traffic steering (TS) in multi-RAT scenarios is challenging due to factors such as high mobility, ultra-dense networks, overall dynamic network conditions, and the unique needs of individual users. In this context, we propose a bi-level approach, called BIL-TS, which includes (i) centrally determining the optimality of RATs and (ii) locally making TS decisions. BIL-TS utilizes the Actor-Critic SARSA Reinforcement Learning (ACS-RL) in level (i) to evaluate the optimality of RATs by considering the entire network, and level (ii) leverages Linear Regression (LR) to make decisions of TS to the optimal RAT based on specific requirements of each UE. Simulation results show that our proposed BILTS approach significantly enhances efficiency in TS, resulting in higher throughput, reduced packet loss, and lower latency."

In order to achieve non-local receptive fields and cross scale fusion in various domains, we propose a novel algorithm which integrates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) with Mamba in hyperspectral image classification task. Specifically, we propose three key modules: the Spatial-Frequency Interaction Module, the FFC Module, and the Adaptive Bidirectional Mamba Module. The Spatial-Frequency Interaction Module is adopted for preprocessing and positional attention mechanisms. The FFC Module splits the data into global and local units at a certain ratio. Local output is obtained by summing local and global inputs processed through standard convolutions, while global output is derived by processing global input using Fourier unit and local Fourier unit. These two outputs are then concatenated and fed into the Adaptive Bidirectional Mamba Module, where Mamba is constructed hierarchically. At last, experimental results validates the effectiveness of our proposed method."

    "abstract": "With the increasing need for improved cybersecurity, the limitations of traditional password-based authentication systems have become more evident. This study proposes an AI-enhanced authentication method using keystroke dynamics to reinforce password security. By leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze users' unique typing patterns, the system offers an added layer of defense against unauthorized access, particularly in mitigating threats such as credential theft, phishing, and brute-force attacks. The research explores various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to determine their effectiveness in classifying genuine users versus impostors. Experimental results show that Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 93.2%, making it the best-performing model in this study. This high accuracy demonstrates the reliability of keystroke dynamics as a method for continuous user authentication. The system’s feasibility is further underscored by its ability to scale easily within existing infrastructures without significant hardware changes. Furthermore, the solution has potential for widespread integration into real-world security systems, providing a robust and non-intrusive method for user verification across various platforms, from personal devices to enterprise-level applications."

    "abstract": "BGP prefix hijacking, when an Autonomous System (AS) wrongly advertises IP routes it is not authorized to announce, remains a serious threat to Internet routing. Cryptographic solutions like RPKI (Route Origin Validation) and BGPsec can stop simple origin hijacks, but their use is still not widespread, leaving many networks at risk. In reality, many Internet Routing Registry (IRR) entries are outdated, which allows attackers to insert fake announcements. In this work, we present a framework that combines sequence-based deep learning and graph-based learning to identify prefix hijacks in real time. We take in live BGP updates from CAIDA's BGPStream and RouteViews/RIS collectors. We extract both temporal features, such as announcement frequency and AS-path changes, and structural features, which include AS-level topology graphs with centrality measures. Our model consists of three branches: a 1D-CNN that processes embedded AS-path sequences, a stacked bidirectional LSTM that handles time-series feature vectors, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that analyzes the AS topology. These branches are combined and sent to a classifier that uses binary cross-entropy loss, or an autoencoder to score anomalies. On realistic datasets with known hijack incidents (training on 2019, testing on 2020), our approach achieves very high detection rates, with over 98% accuracy and about 0.98 F1. We compare our method to previous approaches, such as Park et al.'s autoencoder and a recent MAD+ML hybrid, and show better precision and recall. We also address limitations caused by data gaps, like outdated IRR records, and note that BGP monitors can be tampered with by adversaries."

The aim of this research work is to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to forecast students into three categories, \"Dropout\", \"Enrolled\", and \"Graduate\". This research utilizes a real-world dataset of Portuguese higher education students from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Four machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost were implemented and compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score performance metrics. The results indicate that XGBoost achieved the best overall performance, with an accuracy of 76.95% and an F1-score of 76.28%, outperforming the next best model by approximately 1.7%. Future studies could expand this research using multi-institutional datasets and explore techniques to improve interpretability in complex ensemble models."

    "abstract": "Emotion classification based on multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has been the focus of several previous studies utilizing spatiotemporal analysis. EEG signals from multiple channels can be extracted using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Depthwise-Cnn significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity by separating spatial and channel-wise feature extraction, making the model more efficient and lightweight. This paper proposed a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Parallel Depthwise Separable CNN and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for emotion classification. The EEG signal is extracted from different frequency bands, which show strong associations with human emotional states. The EEG signal was extracted into frequency bands using the Wavelet transform. Each band—theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—is modeled by an independent sub-network using a hybrid DSCNN and RNN enhanced by an attention mechanism. Their outputs are fused to leverage complementary information. Experiments on the SEED dataset, involving 15 participants and three emotion categories (positive, neutral, and negative), demonstrate that the framework strikes a good balance between accuracy and computational cost. Comparative analysis indicates that the 2D CNN achieves the highest accuracy (83.28%). At the same time, the 1D DSCNN offers the most efficient design, reducing parameters and inference time without significant loss of accuracy compared to the 1D CNN. These results highlight the promise of lightweight architectures for real-time EEG emotion recognition."

The AI model identifies the center positions of plant leaves, allowing for targeted pesticide application. Experimental results show an average positioning deviation of 1.56 cm from the leaf center, yet the spray effectively reached the target. The system achieved an 86% success rate across 50 trials and reduced pesticide usage by 15.5% compared to a conventional spraying system.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue. This paper explores the use of beam-steering antennas and UAV swarm formation adaptation in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach is used to jointly optimize beam directions, swarm formation and traffic routing. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for future research."

The second method employs attention-based merging, joint filtering, and reinforcement optimization to enhance thoughts. Based on what the user says and what's going on, the third program changes ideas in real time. These pieces allow the system to adapt to user needs. Many studies have proven that the recommended method is more effective than joint filtering, matrix factorization, deep neural networks, and context-aware mixed models. Customer engagement (85.4 %), conversion (17.9 %), suggestion accuracy (94.5%), and response time (1.2 seconds) have changed significantly. Business uses the strategy since it boosts customer term value and marketing ROI. Attention processes, reinforcement learning, and variation regularization help the model balance important, novel, and scalable items.

Plankton are very valuable bioindicators of environmental health but their traditional identification by microscopic examination is time-consuming and error-prone. The present attempt overcomes this limitation using deep learning. The solution was to preprocess and enrich a raw collection of 78 images from the Makassar River to generate a resulting collection of 333 images with 20 proxy species annotation. The models were validated on the major performance criteria: speed of detection, inference time, and performance against small and dense objects. The outcome is an evident trade-off between the models. The DETR model had a higher average accuracy of $\\mathbf{8 4. 5 \\%}$ against YOLOv8n’s $81.7 \\%$, performing superior in the handling of complex morphological details. However, YOLOv8n was significantly faster with an approximate inference rate of 180 ms against 450 ms for DETR. The choice between the two models this hinges on the priorities of the application. DETR is more appropriate for high-accuracy and high-precision applications, while YOLOv8n is optimal in real-time surveillance applications where the most limiting factor is speed. This work contributes to building an improved methodology for scalable technology evolution for aquatic ecosystem monitoring and paves the way for further studies on ensemble or hybrid model architectures."

However, their nodes are typically battery-powered and have limited energy, making them vulnerable to vampire attacks, where malicious nodes exploit the routing protocol to drain nodes batteries with routing loop or route diversion. To detect and mitigate vampire attacks many research done in wireless sensor network but these solutions do not directly adopted to FANET because of high mobility and frequently topology changes and constraints of wireless aerial links. In this paper, we proposed a heuristic based vampire attack detection to defend FANET. The heuristic identify suspicious routing behavior by monitoring metrics such as path hop-length stretch, loop occurrences and energy consumption per forwarded packet. When a node's routing behavior exceeds threshold heuristics the protocol isolates the suspect nodes by restricting their participation in route formation. Through the network simulation apply varied mobility model of random way point and attack scenarios our heuristic approach increases packet delivery ratio and maintains acceptable latency compared to baseline routing protocols without protection."

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose an energy-efficient relay selection algorithm for clustered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In contrast to conventional multi-hop transmission schemes adopted in clustered WSNs, where only cluster heads (CHs) participate in the transmission, in our method the relay is selected from a set of candidate nodes within the source transmission range, subject to predefined desired transmission power at the source and the relay. The fundamental of this method is to forward the source signal using the node which minimizes the end-to-end total path distance, such that the total energy cost per bit is reduced at the relay and at the source. Thus, the node that satisfies the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distance-based threshold of both links participates in the transmission. Taking into consideration the circuit energy cost, the modulation strategy and its impact on energy cost are investigated and the optimal choice of the number of bits per symbol is considered to optimize the total energy cost per transmission. The proposed method is shown to be more energy efficient compared to the traditional multi-hop transmission and random relay selection in terms of energy cost for a target bit error rate at the destination. Additionally, the proposed method also outperforms both methods in terms of the network lifetime."

Even though many LF compression techniques have been proposed and evaluated in recent years, the leading-edge learning-based approaches have not been subject to the same level of scrutiny. This paper presents a subjective quality assessment study on four different LF compression methods, including two learning-based LF compression methods, which have not been studied before from a subjective quality point of view. For this purpose, subjective opinion scores were collected from viewers in two different universities for a cross-lab study. The results indicate that the learning-based compression methods have different behavior in their rate-distortion curves, and that there is room for improvement for learning-based methods. A qualitative analysis also shows that their artifact structures are different from conventional ones. The results highlight the need for a perceptual objective quality metric that takes different types of artifacts into account. The obtained subjective quality database (MiX-LFQDB) is made public to support further research in this area: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16778670"

    "abstract": "Cooperative maneuver planning promises to significantly improve traffic efficiency at unsignalized intersections by leveraging connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Previous works on this topic have been mostly developed for completely automated traffic in a simple simulated environment. By contrast, our previously introduced planning approaches are specifically designed to handle real-world mixed traffic. The two methods are based on multiscenario prediction and graph-based reinforcement learning, respectively. This is the first study to perform evaluations in a novel mixed-traffic simulation framework as well as real-world drives with prototype CAVs in public traffic. The simulation features the same connected automated driving software stack as deployed on one of the automated vehicles. Our quantitative evaluations show that cooperative maneuver planning achieves a substantial reduction in crossing times and the number of stops. In a realistic environment with few automated vehicles, there are noticeable efficiency gains with only slightly increasing criticality metrics."

    "abstract": "Ultra-wideband (UWB), a short-pulse radio technology with high time resolution, has shown great potential for high-accuracy indoor positioning. However, UWB-based localization still faces significant challenges in multipath-rich nonline-of-sight (NLOS) environments. Traditional geometry-based positioning methods tend to overestimate distances, while existing deep learning approaches often fail to capture the complex spatial and temporal characteristics of UWB signal propagation, leading to limited positioning accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) dual-fusion network inspired by multipath physical information for indoor positioning, termed PosFormer. The Transformer and CNN modules of PosFormer capture the long-distance dependencies and spatial characteristics of channel impulse responses (CIRs), effectively extracting both global and local multiscale features. In addition, we design a nonadjacent anchor-subsets (NAASs) scheme to enrich the diversity of CIRs and introduce a lightweight transfer learning (TL) framework to improve deployment robustness across environments with limited labeled data. Extensive experiments on public industrial datasets demonstrate that PosFormer achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 17.64 cm, significantly outperforming classical models such as CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and Transformer. In industrial hall environments with numerous metal obstacles, TL enables the pretrained model to achieve a positioning accuracy of 35.92 cm with only 20% of the fingerprint samples, highlighting its practical value for cross-environment deployment."

Their functioning, however, can be degraded depending on the exposure to environmental pollution. This study aims to understand the Voltage distribution on the overhead insulator strings under the influence of different contamination profiles. First, the fundamental background of pin-type glass and porcelain insulators, chosen test parameters at a high voltage level $(132 \\mathrm{kV})$, and pointers to allied prior work are determined. The electrical characteristics of glass and porcelain insulator strings were investigated under clean, dusty, and salty conditions. Simulations were done using the Finite Element Method Magnetic (FEMM) software. The results were compared and analysed between both porcelain and glass insulators in order to identify which one of them performs better in each contamination scenario and the voltage distribution along the insulator string. The most critical parameters that were employed to check the performance of insulators included voltage distribution, flux density magnitude, and normal field intensity. The results indicated that the voltage distribution along the glass string insulator performs better compared to porcelain under dust, water, and salt contamination conditions."

    "abstract": "Slang interpretation has been a challenging downstream task for Large Language Models (LLMs) as the expressions are inherently embedded in contextual, cultural, and linguistic frameworks. In the absence of domain-specific training data, it is difficult for LLMs to accurately interpret slang meaning based on lexical information. This paper attempts to investigate the challenges of slang inference using large LLMs and presents a greedy search-guided chain-of-thought framework for slang interpretation. Through our experiments, we conclude that the model size and temperature settings have limited impact on inference accuracy. Transformer-based models with larger active parameters do not generate higher accuracy than smaller models. Based on the results of the above empirical study, we integrate greedy search algorithms with chain-of-thought prompting for small language models to build a framework that improves the accuracy of slang interpretation. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework demonstrates improved accuracy in slang meaning interpretation. These findings contribute to the understanding of context dependency in language models and provide a practical solution for enhancing slang comprehension through a structured reasoning prompting framework."

In SOFC, Ni/YSZbased cells are the industry benchmark due to their economic value, chemical stability, mechanical durability, and well-established processing compatibility. This study was undertaken to develop high-performance SOFCs by systematically optimising the fabrication parameters of a six-layer planar Ni/YSZ cell architecture and to solve fabrication challenges associated with interlayer material and microstructural mismatches. Multilayer tape casting or co-casting were employed to construct the half-cells, followed by a two-stage co-sintering protocol, targeting mechanical strength establishment and microstructure particle arrangement in the first stage and flattening procedure in the second stage. Material selection and layer composition were optimised to enhance porosity, triple-phase boundary (TPB) density, and interfacial integrity. GDC barrier layers deposition was attempted with tape casting, screen printing and spin-coating with spin coating as the best thin layer deposition technique. Based on the highest performance sample, thin electrolyte and barrier layer thicknesses were achieved; 3.74 and $6.63 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, respectively. Double cathode layer with different thicknesses were attempted with sample with thick cathode current collection layer (CCL) give the highest performance. The optimised in-house fabricated cell achieved an open-circuit voltage of 1.05 V and a peak power density of $0.78 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, outperforming the commercial reference by $42 \\%$. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of fabrication process refinement in improving the electrochemical and structural performance of Ni/YSZ-based SOFCs, while maintaining compatibility with scalable manufacturing practices."

Traditional keyword-based QA methods, while effective at basic information retrieval, struggle with contextual understanding and synonym recognition. Subsequently, deep learning models improved these aspects but faced challenges in providing structured answers. The introduction of LLMs addressed many of these limitations; however, they introduced issues like hallucination and high costs for API-based implementations. Our study proposes a cost-effective, privacy-respecting solution that leverages Ollama to run LLMs locally, eliminating the need for cloud-based API calls and mitigating data privacy concerns. Additionally, extensive testing on a structured dataset demonstrates improved accuracy and relevance in answers, making our solution well-suited for secure environments where data sensitivity and cost-efficiency are paramount. This paper contributes a scalable, secure architecture for document-based QA, providing a comprehensive alternative to traditional and cloud-dependent methods."

This paper addresses the prediction of battery voltage by developing a regression model based on time-of-day and ambient temperature. The study utilized empirical voltage data from a deployed Tank Toad AC-2 water level monitoring device and corresponding historical weather data (temperature and cloud cover) from open-meteo.com for the period September 1, 2024, to February 10, 2025. A stepwise regression methodology, implemented in Mathcad, was employed. Data was initially filtered to isolate nighttime discharge periods following days with low cloud cover, minimizing solar charging effects, with temperature data subsequently binned. The analysis involved fitting power functions to voltage versus time data within temperature bins, followed by second-order polynomial approximation of the power function coefficients against temperature. This yielded an analytical regression model representing the voltage surface. Validation showed good agreement with empirical data, achieving a relative error of 1.37% at a control point. The derived model provides a practical tool for predicting battery state, contributing to improved energy efficiency and operational reliability for autonomous IoT systems."

While PBL is widely used to teach technical and soft skills in the engineering classroom, there are often struggles in team coordination and collaboration. Scrum, an agile project management framework originally developed for software engineering, has emerged in the literature as an effective framework that can structure and support teamwork environments. This paper specifically looks at Globally Distributed Scrum Teams (GDSTs) to see how challenges related to teamwork and collaboration can be solved when the environment is not conducive to collaboration. Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of 980 sources, 14 peerreviewed studies were identified. These studies detail communication and relationship challenges in GDSTs and outline solutions within adaptations to the Scrum framework. Findings were categorized into communication practices, relationshipbuilding strategies, and adaptations to the Scrum framework. Within these categories, the proposed solutions were mapped to actionable practices that are attainable in the engineering classroom. As a result, this paper offers evidence-based recommendations seeking to improve the experience and effectiveness of teamwork in PBL through Scrum. By translating the best practices found in industry to educational settings, this study supports the development of more impactful learning of both technical and soft skills for engineering students."

However, this increased interconnectivity introduces new security vulnerabilities. Bot malware and cyberattacks pose significant risks to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), as demonstrated by real-world incidents involving remote vehicle system compromise. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic to and from CAVs. Our detection model is based on a meta-ensemble classifier capable of recognizing known (N day) attacks and detecting previously unseen (zero-day) attacks. The approach involves training multiple Isolation Forest (IF) models on Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers, with each IF specialized in identifying a specific type of botnet attack. These IFs, either trained locally or shared by other MEC nodes, are then aggregated using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based stacking strategy to construct a robust meta-classifier. The proposed IDS has been evaluated on a vehicular botnet dataset, achieving an average detection rate of $92.80 \\%$ for N -day attacks and $77.32 \\%$ for zero-day attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of our solution in detecting both known and emerging threats, providing a scalable and adaptive defense mechanism for CAVs within the IoV ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a lethal urological cancer, and high mortality rates associated with the disease are frequently due to late diagnosis and the functional diversity of a tumor. Current diagnostic paradigms, mostly depending on radiological visualization and histopathological evaluation, are plagued with problems in the form of inter-observer variation and lag time in detection, and are also inadequate in recapitulating the heterogeneous nature of the tumor microenvironment. To address these challenges, in this work we propose an intelligent diagnostic framework combining quantumenhanced expandable neural networks (Q-ENNs) and medical imaging for precision oncology. In contrast to traditional DL models, Q-ENNs leverage quantum parallelism and entanglement-induced strategies to traverse high-dimensional imaging spaces by outperforming feature extraction and diagnostic performance. The scalable design can flexibly scale network layers and qubits according to clinical requirements, allowing multi-stage RCC diagnosis. Q-ENNs trained on multimodal imaging data (including CT, MRI, and histopathological slides) outperform state-of-theart convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the tasks of tumor detection, staging, and subtype classification. In addition, the quantum-assisted optimization approach accelerates the convergence and alleviates local minima, which are not only benefit for better discrimination performance but also robust diagnostic results among different populations of patients. We validate our results by clinical evaluation, where a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity with higher interpretability are obtained with respect to state-of-the-art through explainable quantum feature mapping, as claimed in precision oncology terms. The system we present is intended to be deployed in a realistic clinical setting, supporting computational performance (scalability), integration in the existing radiology workflow, and generic imaging modalities. By interfacing principles of quantum computing with clinical applications, this study paves the road for the future of oncology diagnostics. These discoveries underpin that quantum-driven diagnostic systems could change the way RCC is assessed, providing for earlier and more reliable detection, help in the personalization of treatment and thus enhance patient outcomes in precision oncology."

For long-term tracking, current methods such as basal body temperature monitoring and urine-based hormone detection can be challenging and expensive. The proposed method illustrates a cloud-integrated ovulation detection technique using microscopic analysis of saliva Ferning. The image acquisition system serves as an IoT device, consists of a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, Raspberry Pi high quality camera mounted with a 100x microscopic lens and a white diffuser type LED source. For dataset preparation 100 sample images were collected for both ovulation and non-ovulation classes. The captured images are directly transmitted to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform for further processing. In the cloud, the images stored in Azure Blob Storage which triggers an Azure Function to begin the image classification process using Azure Custom Vision. In order to train the classification model, data augmentation was performed for the collected sample images. The results show that, the system ensures effective cloud performance with low latency dropping below 3 ms for image upload. In addition, the classification model attained high accuracy with precision and recall exceeding 98%.For a comparative evaluation with custom vision classifier, a ResNet50V2-based deep learning model trained on augmented dataset achieved 96% classification accuracy, further validating the potential of AI driven ovulation detection. The proposed pipeline offers sustainability in terms of computational efficiency by offloading the image processing tasks to the cloud server and also reduces power consumption on local hardware system. Moreover, this architecture ensures scalability by enabling large scale data storage for a continuous usage.

A custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) is developed and trained on 8,001 mel-spectral feature samples, with an end-to-end pipeline optimized for imbalanced data scenarios. The model is benchmarked against standard CNN and DNN baselines using stratified train–validation splits and evaluated across multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results show that FOCUS achieves 96.48% precision and 96.46% F1-score, consistently outperforming traditional approaches.

Traditional signal-processing and deep-learning approaches treat biosignals as sequences or images, often neglecting the inherent relational and topological structure among sensors, anatomical sites, and temporal segments. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a principled framework to encode such relational information, fuse multimodal streams, and perform inference with explicit modeling of inter-sensor and inter-feature dependencies. This paper presents a comprehensive treatment of GNN architectures, representation strategies, and optimization techniques tailored for real-time biosignal analysis in wearable systems. We (1) formalize biosignal-to-graph transformations that preserve physiological adjacency and functional coupling, (2) evaluate spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal GNN variants for latency-constrained tasks (arrhythmia detection, cuffless blood-pressure estimation, EEG-based event detection, and activity recognition), (3) propose lightweight graph convolution and message-passing modules designed for edge inference and energy-efficient deployment, and (4) assess robustness to noise, missing channels, and variable sampling using both open benchmarks and a curated wearable dataset. Results demonstrate that appropriately constructed GNNs improve detection accuracy and calibration while reducing feature-engineering requirements, and that model pruning, quantization, and architecture search enable real-time inference on resource-limited wearable hardware. We conclude with a roadmap addressing clinical validation, privacy-preserving ondevice learning, and standardization of graph construction for reproducible biosignal GNN research."

In addressing this challenge, hardware-based Secure Elements become a crucial component in facilitating cryptographic operations and storing secret keys within these frameworks. However, the design and validation of such hardware modules require substantial time investment. Consequently, this can result in the allocation of time that could be utilized for the development of other essential components of the Post-Quantum Transition. In this context, the present work proposes a methodology for the integration of Secure Elements on IoT devices, with the objective of reducing the time required for design and validation. To this end, two distinct categories of IoT devices (microcontrollers and embedded processors) have been employed to encompass the broadest possible range of IoT devices. The outcome of this study is the delivery of an open-source cryptographic library that can be deployed in any type of IoT devices. This library facilitates the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography in Secure Elements enabling crypto-agility and ensuring a smooth PostQuantum transition for IoT."

    "abstract": "As edge computing, AI data centers, and supercomputing systems continue to expand, the challenge of deterministic computing power routing has become increasingly prominent. In response, this paper proposes a new hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that combines node clustering with routing optimization. Our approach employs a hybrid clustering method that integrates Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and K-Means algorithms to categorize computing nodes into distinct groups based on their operational states and past performance. This framework uses reinforcement learning techniques to optimally match deterministic applications with the relevant node clusters, while modeling the selection of nodes and path planning as a Stackelberg game problem. We solve this game-theoretical problem using a dual-agent reinforcement learning architecture, enhanced by graph neural networks to boost generalization. Additionally, we incorporate a shortest-path-based link attention mechanism to speed up model convergence. Our proposed solution addresses the shortcomings of traditional methods, which often treat node selection and path planning separately. This integrated approach leads to more efficient use of resources and better satisfies deterministic transmission needs."

    "abstract": "The advancement of clinical decision support systems depends on the essential integration of medical images together with their corresponding textual reports. The paradigm of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) shows promise because it uses external knowledge sources to support Large Language Model (LLM) responses. Recent advances such as MMed-RAG demonstrate up to 43.8% improvement in factual accuracy for medical vision-language tasks. This research investigates three main approaches to implement MRAG for medical image understanding through (1) API-based access to strong general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini), (2) local deployment of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA, DoRA), and (3) a hybrid method that uses pre-trained embedding models (e.g., CLIP, MedCLIP, BiomedCLIP) for local structured knowledge base retrieval alongside a local VLM for secure context-aware response generation. The evaluation assesses these methods through their documented capabilities and literature-based model efficacy and data privacy aspects for Protected Health Information (PHI) and evaluates their deployment complexity and cost alongside scalability and customizability and latency and transparency and knowledge updatability. Through a conceptual case study and decision framework, we analyze the trade-offs for typical healthcare institutions. The research establishes particular medical use cases which demonstrate the best fit for each approach under strict Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations and data privacy standards including HIPAA and GDPR. This research establishes a decision framework for healthcare ecosystem MRAG solution selection and implementation to address specific healthcare challenges."

Given Malaysians’ high smartphone usage, the primary objective is to design a user-centred mobile app prototype, \"SafeBite\", that translates complex food safety guidelines into an accessible format, enhancing public understanding and compliance. This study adopts the design thinking methodology, emphasising the creation of an intuitive and informative prototype that bridges academic insights with practical application. A mixed-methods approach was used, including surveys and interviews to gather insights from undergraduate students and cultivators. These findings provide valuable insights for developing user personas, user journey maps, user flows, and system architecture, leading to both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes. Usability testing was conducted using the System Usability Scale (SUS) to evaluate the prototype’s design and functionality.

Recent advancements in deep learning offer new opportunities for financial forecasting, but their deployment is frequently limited by high training costs and resource constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a cost-efficient deep learning model optimization framework for profit prediction using FAIS on cloud platform. The proposed methodology integrates an enhanced cubature Kalman optimization (ECKO) algorithm within a cloud infrastructure to enable scalable data storage and efficient resource management, significantly reducing the time and cost associated with large-scale financial analysis. For feature analysis, a transformer model is used to capture complex dependencies and financial patterns. A deep Q-learning model is used for profit prediction, optimizing decision-making within the financial accounting process. The performance of the proposed model is validated using a real-world Kaggle financial accounting dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed cloud-powered framework achieves superior prediction accuracy while reducing model training costs by 35% compared to conventional deep learning models."

In this paper a new Federated Neuro-Symbolic Adaptive Defense Model (FNS-ADM) has been suggested, to support distributed learning, meta-optimization, and symbolic reasoning to increase the threat detection ability and interpretability. The proposed model uses the lightweight neural encoders at the edge to extract the compressed behavioral representations and make localized anomaly detection with the help of few-shot meta-learners. A federated meta-aggregator actively unites model parameters depending on the device reliability and data homogeneity that will allow vigorous global generalization without at the cost of privacy. Anomalies that are detected are now subjected to a symbolic reasoning layer which derives high-level attack semantics and gives human understandable explanations. With the combination of federated meta-learning and neuro-symbolic reasoning, FNS-ADM can be highly adaptable to novel and changing threats being trained and scaled and be transparent. The experimental validation with the help of the benchmark IoT intrusion datasets shows that the suggested framework is superior to the traditional hybrid and centralized recognition systems in terms of detection accuracy, convergence speed, and the ability of connection efficiency. The findings approve that FNS-ADM is a privacy-preserving, explainable paradigm of defense applicable to real-time security surveillance of large-scale heterogeneous networks in IoT security-related matters. The suggested FNS-ADM model attained an overall accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 5 \\%}$</tex>, exhibiting enhanced detection performance relative to current methodologies."

In order to effectively instruct learners in programming exercises, it is important to grasp the situation of individual learners. However, it is often difficult to do so when a few teachers are responsible for a large number of learners. In addition, the directions taken to construct a program (called programming logics) differ by each learner, even for the same challenge in the programming exercise, which can be particularly difficult for teachers to grasp. While there are many methods for supporting programming exercises, none are able to deal with the diversity of programming logics. Our objective is therefore to develop methods for estimating programming logics from incomplete source codes under being written by individual learners. In this paper, we mainly describe methods for estimating programming logics by means of machine learning that adopts syntax trees as training data. Our experimental findings demonstrate the basic effectiveness of our methods."

During the cost computation stage, a mean Census transform is introduced, which uses the average pixel intensity within a window as the reference grayscale value to enhance robustness against noise and illumination variations. In the cost aggregation stage, an adaptive cross-arm window mechanism is adopted to dynamically adjust the aggregation range according to image content, thereby improving matching accuracy in depth-discontinuous regions. Experimental evaluations conducted on source container, source chamber, and buckle within a depth range of 400–600 mm demonstrate that the relative errors range from 0.46% to 1.28%, confirming the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method for high-precision localization of key radioactive source components."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of smart systems requires superior structures that can derive meaningful representations out of multifaceted and disparate information. Traditional deep learning models lack the ability to handle redundancy, low interpretability, and low efficiency in optimization of multimodal processing. This paper proposes HARMONIC-Net (Hierarchical Attention-Refined Multimodal Optimization Network for Intelligent Classification) as a new architecture that improves the representation of semantics and cross-domain flexibility. The hierarchical attention refinement has been incorporated into the proposed model to sequentially refine the attention to the coarse-fine contextual relationship between capturing and amplifying critical features and suppressing noise respectively. A multimodal embedding fusion technique synchronises many inputs, including textual, visual, and audible data, into a cohesive latent space, using adjustable weighting of modalities to facilitate equal learning. The understanding of consistency is used to supply supplementary structured domain priors, hence enhancing the process of generalisation and semantics consistency. Dynamic gradients control is being applied to stabilise optimum by adapted regulating learning rates in relation to attribute entropy. The design is being integrated into a scalable decoding-encoding system that enhances interpretability and robustness of tasks involving classification. Experimental studies are anticipated to provide superior accuracy, efficient convergence, and enhanced clarity compared to current leading technologies. Overall, HARMONIC-Net signifies a significant advancement toward comprehensible, scalable, and resilient intelligent technologies in application. The proposed strategy achieved an overall accuracy of 94%, significantly exceeding previous techniques."

    "abstract": "In this Research-to-practice WIP paper we present an analysis of the integration of a code quality tool into a bootcamp-style CS1 course, with a focus on correlating quality issues with a superficial understanding of programming by examining the relationship between code quality issues and limited programming comprehension. Although initially studied in the context of Software Engineering courses, there has also been interest in including code quality in CS1/2 levels. In this paper we examine two main questions: (i) which types of errors do students make when solving CS1 coding questions?, and (ii) is there a correlation between certain types of errors and student performance? We hypothesize that the type and frequency of errors are inversely proportional to students' performance and proportional to assignment complexity. We added a code quality tool to all assignments of an intensive CS1 course and did a retrospective analysis using data from two course offerings in 2024 (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{N}=66$</tex> students, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{N}=851$</tex> code submissions). We analyze 5 high-stakes exams and 5 low-stakes quizzes, computing the frequency and type of the issues flagged. We also correlate each issue type with students' performance. Our analysis shows that most code quality issues identified in student submissions are related to formatting and style, not to code structure. Tasks involving more complex data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, tend to have a higher frequency of code structure-related issues. However, student performance was inversely proportional to issues that were not related to code structure, such as formatting or incorrect use of Python features. Finally, high-performing students still produce code with a significant amount of code quality issues."

Findings indicate that students perceived simulation and hardware as equally important for early learning and concept development.

Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach, PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits, faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities, designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs, along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued, its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to experiment with and scale PjBL practices."

Traditional computational approaches often face challenges in scalability and identifying novel sequences. This study evaluates the performance of several pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) on two key classification tasks: kinase/phosphatase differentiation and transmembrane protein identification. We fine-tuned and assessed CAFA-5, ChatterjeLab/PepMLM, and ChatterjeLab/MeMDLM using UniProtKB for kinase/phosphatase data and ActTRANS for transmembrane proteins. In contrast to earlier studies such as ActTRANS which focused on binary classification using frozen embeddings and SVMs. The proposed approach employs an end-to-end neural classifier in a broader multi-class setting, demonstrating greater generalizability across protein families. The integration of LLMs with protein sequence analysis offers a scalable and accurate solution that can accelerate drug discovery and optimize therapeutic strategies. CAFA-5 consistently outperformed other models, ranking first in both tasks. It achieved 90% accuracy, 89.74% balanced accuracy, and an Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.7995 in kinase/phosphatase classification, and 98.9% accuracy with a perfect MCC of 1.0 for transmembrane proteins. While PepMLM also performed well (91.89% accuracy, MCC: 0.84), MeMDLM scored lower (80.53% accuracy, MCC: 0.63). These results highlight the capability of LLMs to detect complex sequence patterns and outperform traditional methods. This work not only advances computational biology but also contributes to precision medicine, particularly in areas like oncology, where understanding kinase-phosphatase dynamics is critical."

We evaluate three fixed-point formats (Q4.12, Q5.11, and Q6.10) and introduce a LUT generation technique that employs dense sampling with a step size of 0.125 in high-curvature regions and sparse sampling with a step size of 0.5 in saturation regions. Combined with the symmetry property of the sigmoid, this approach reduces LUT memory by more than half while preserving accuracy. Both the sigmoid function and its derivative are implemented in hardware, supporting efficient neural network training and inference. Synthesized on FPGA, the designs are analyzed in terms of precision and hardware resource utilization. Among these, Q5.11 achieves the lowest error, with a maximum below 6×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−4</sup>, representing an over 93% reduction compared to Q4.12 (maximum error 9.2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup>) and a approximately 96% reduction compared to Q6.10 (maximum error 1.5×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−2</sup>).

    "abstract": "Compared with the conventional twin support vector machine (TSVM), the least squares TWSVM (LSTSVM) possesses the advantages of faster training speed and better generalization performance. However, the square loss function is used in the optimization problems of LSTSVM, which makes it sensitive to noise contained in training samples and thus suffers from poor generalization ability. In this article, a novel adaptive pinball loss function is proposed, which possesses the merits of both pinball and smooth pinball loss functions. Under a certain condition, the convexity of the adaptive pinball loss function is guaranteed. Furthermore, to improve the anti-noise and generalization abilities of LSTSVM, a robust LSTSVM (RLS-TWSVM) is developed by replacing the square loss function in LSTSVM with the adaptive pinball loss function. The iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLSs) method is adopted to solve the optimization problems of the proposed RLS-TWSVM. The computational complexity and convergence analysis for the training procedure of the RLS-TWSVM are both provided. Moreover, it is proven that the proposed method is insensitive to noise distributed near the classification boundary. It is also shown that the proposed method can simultaneously minimize within-class scatter and misclassification error. In experiments, the proposed method outperforms ten related methods in anti-noise and generalization. Especially, compared with the second-best methods, the proposed method achieves a total average accuracy increase of 3.28% and 1.16% on the original, feature noise-polluted, and label noise-polluted benchmark datasets and MINIST, respectively.

    "abstract": "This research full paper presents findings of an online survey that examined international students' mental health challenges and their coping strategies, as well as their experience with counseling. Guided by Acculturative Stress Theory, international students encounter stress from both extrinsic and intrinsic sources. The extrinsic stressors mostly come from academic pressure, financial concerns, and sociocultural adjustment difficulties, whereas the intrinsic stressors are largely related to post-graduation uncertainty and visa status concerns. Cultural stigma emerged as a significant barrier to seeking professional help, with many students perceiving mental health struggles as a personal weakness. As a result, self-management was common. Students often relied on social support, entertainment, relaxation activities, and campus engagement to manage stress and anxiety. While relatively few had accessed in-person counseling, a substantial majority expressed interest in remote counseling services, citing enhanced privacy, scheduling flexibility, and the elimination of transportation barriers as the advantages. These findings highlight the need for universities to develop culturally sensitive support systems integrating both in-person and remote counseling services. Additionally, increasing awareness of available resources, adjusting financial aid, and structuring programs to support cultural adjustment are crucial for promoting mental well-being and academic success of international students. These insights can guide universities in designing more inclusive mental health support systems."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a mixed learning-based and optimization-based approach to the weighted-sum-rates beamforming problem in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless network. The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm."

    "abstract": "With the functions of egocentric observation and multimodal perception equipped in augmented reality (AR) devices, the next generation of smart assistants has the potential to reduce human labor and enhance execution efficiency in assembly tasks. Among diverse assembly activity understanding tasks, anticipating the near future activities is crucial yet challenging, which can assist humans or agents to actively plan and engage in interactions with the environment. However, the existing egocentric activity anticipation methods still struggle to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, hindering them to be deployed in practical applications. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a goal-guided prompting framework with adaptive modality selection (GP-AMS), for assembly activity anticipation in egocentric videos. For bridging the semantic gap between the historical observations and unobserved future activities, we inject the inferred high-level goal clues into the constructed prompts, which are further utilized to guide a pre-trained vision-language (V-L) model to compensate relevant semantics of unseen future. Moreover, a mask-and-predict strategy is adopted with two imposed constraints, i.e., casual masking and probabilistic token-dropping, to mine the intrinsic associations between the assembly activities within a specific procedure. For maintaining the benefits of exploiting multimodal information while avoiding extensively increasing the computational burdens, an adaptive modality selection strategy is designed to train a policy network, which learns to dynamically decide which modalities should be sampled for processing by the anticipation model on a per observation time-step basis. By allocating major computation to the selected indicative modalities on-the-fly, the efficiency of the overall model can be improved, thus paving the way for feasibility on real-world devices. Extensive experimental results on two public data sets validate that the proposed method yields not only consistent improvements in anticipation accuracy, but also significant savings in computation budgets."

One such problem is to find the discrete logarithm in a finite group. The problem consists in obtaining for any two elements of the group such natural number that the first element to the power of this number is equal to the second one. To implement a cryptosystem, one must choose a specific finite group and a high order element in it (so that computing the discrete logarithm is a hard problem). Quantum computers will be able to solve efficiently the discrete logarithm problem in the most common finite groups (the multiplicative group of a prime or an extended finite field, the group of points of an elliptic curve over a finite field). Therefore, as one of the directions, they study groups consisting of units of group rings specified by a certain ring and a group. In this paper, the issue of finding high order units for partial group rings, which are given by any finite field and finite cyclic group, is investigated."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of small lesions is critical for the early diagnosis and intervention of severe diseases. U-shaped networks (U-Nets) are widely used models for lesion segmentation, renowned for their strong feature extraction capabilities and encoder–decoder architecture, which incorporates direct skip connection (DSC) to preserve spatial details. However, their decoders often exhibit information-specific biases toward the content provided by DSC due to the semantic gap between the encoder-decoder feature sets, rather than maintaining a strict one-to-one correspondence. This semantic mismatch reduces their effectiveness in segmenting small lesions with weak or indistinct features, thereby failing to meet high-precision clinical requirements. To address this limitation, we propose the Semantic Gap-Sensitive Mamba U-shaped Network (SGS-Mamba), enhancing sensitivity to small lesions across three dimensions: long-range interaction, guided filtering and semantic alignment. Specifically, an adaptive Visual State Space block is designed to focus on small lesions by leveraging long-range contextual modeling. A Self-Guided Filtering Attention (SGFA) at the bottleneck is employed to enhance small lesions through noise suppression and attention focus. The Semantic Gap-sensitive Skip Connection (SGSC), incorporating Cross-Guided Filtering module and Rényi divergence regularization, are designed to bridge the semantic gap through long-range interaction and semantic alignment. Experiments conducted on three small lesion datasets and one multi-label dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Furthermore, when the SGFA and SGSC modules are integrated as plug-and-play components within other architectures, they consistently yield substantial improvements, underscoring that their benefits generalize effectively across diverse architectures and tasks."

    "abstract": "This work presents iTempDT, an AI-driven Digital Twin (DT) approach that uses deep learning to forecast indoor temperature based on Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system operations. Accurate temperature forecasting is essential for smart buildings (SBs), which aim to optimize energy efficiency without compromising occupant comfort. iTempDT addresses this need by providing accurate and timely forecasts that allow intelligent HVAC control and energy-efficient decision-making. At the core of iTempDT is a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) integrated with an attention mechanism to capture temporal dynamics and feature dependencies from multivariate time series data collected from both indoor and outdoor sensors. The model is trained for multi-step indoor temperature forecasting, explicitly conditioned on the recent HVAC status (ON/OFF), allowing for real-time predictions as well as scenario-based simulations. Also, an interactive dashboard enables real-time visualization and virtual control of HVAC settings. To promote sustainable and energy-conscious AI practices, iTempDT integrates a Green AI approach by applying post-training quantization. This reduces the model size and speeds up inference, making it suitable for deployment on low-power edge devices. The DT prototype was developed at the ICAR-CNR IoT Lab in Rende, Italy. iTempDT shows strong performance across key metrics (MAE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, and RPD).

    "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the most influential technological paradigms, enabling smart sensing, monitoring, and decision-making across diverse sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, environmental monitoring, industrial automation and many more. However, despite the widespread deployment of IoT networks, a significant challenge persists in extending connectivity to remote and rural regions where conventional network infrastructure like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee are limited by range, power constraints, and lack of coverage in isolated areas. To address this issue, satellite communication offers an effective solution however, its economic constraints and lengthy development timelines limit widespread adoption. In response to these challenges, recent advancements in CubeSats operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) have emerged as a promising alternative, where the integration of CubeSat technology with Long Range (LoRa) communication operating in the ISM band can effectively bridge this gap. This paper presents a CubeSat-based communication system that uses LoRa technology to enable long-range, low-power communication between ground-based IoT nodes and LEO satellites. To evaluate the reliability of the proposed communication link, a High-Altitude Balloon (HAB) experiment was conducted to emulate satellite communication conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the viability of this approach, indicating strong potential for future implementation in satellite–IoT integration scenarios."

The model created was 96.8 percent accurate on a validation on a history of past bookings, competitor rates and external effects including fuel prices and weather and produced an average 8.7 percent increase in income as compared to traditional methods. The SHAP analysis showed that the most significant features are booking lead time, competitor fare difference, and seasonal demand. The quality of the provided system in comparison with accuracy and time of inference is substantiated by comparison with the previous literature.

The objectives of this study are to: (a) develop a simplified architecture of a dangerous spaces monitoring system focused on the interaction between the operator and the UAV; (b) develop a prototype of a HMI using AR technology for UAV operators; (c) develop Markov models that both exclude and include the possibility of operator error during UAV control, for subsequent comparison and assessment of their impact on the system.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Activation functions are fundamental components of deep neural networks, providing the nonlinear transformations that enable complex representation learning and strongly influence model performance in deep learning–based artificial intelligence systems. However, despite their proven importance, commonly used activation functions often suffer from critical limitations such as vanishing or exploding gradients, non-differentiability at zero, and instability during training. These limitations become particularly relevant in image classification and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks, where complex spatial or spatiotemporal dependencies, along with noisy data, can adversely affect training stability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel activation function, ExpAbsTanH, which integrates self-gating with exponential control and smooth nonlinearity. To assess its theoretical robustness and stability, initial experiments were conducted on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, demonstrating that ExpAbsTanH consistently delivers strong classification performance across diverse deep learning architectures. ExpAbsTanH was found to outperform ReLU and Swish in most cases, achieving performance comparable to that of Mish. When integrated into ResNet-200, ExpAbsTanH achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 90.08% on CIFAR-10, highlighting its stability and effectiveness in deep convolutional networks. Beyond static images, the robustness of ExpAbsTanH for HAR was evaluated on the UCF-50 and UCF-101 datasets. For temporally complex tasks, a hybrid model combining ResNet-50 with a single-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and an attention module was employed. On UCF-50, the ExpAbsTanH-based model consistently outperformed the ReLU-based model, achieving Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies of 95.69% and 98.74%, respectively. To further assess its generalization capability, experiments conducted on randomly selected subsets of the UCF-101 dataset demonstrated the highest Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies of 99.47% and 99.79%, respectively. Under noisy conditions, the ExpAbsTanH-based model achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 95.51% on the UCF-50 dataset, consistently surpassing the ReLU-based model. On the UCF-101 dataset, this integration maintained a Top-1 accuracy of 98.63%, demonstrating its robustness against input distortions. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis further revealed that ExpAbsTanH focused on semantically meaningful and spatially coherent features, whereas ReLU occasionally emphasized irrelevant regions. ExpAbsTanH has become a robust and effective alternative activation function, improving the reliability of real-world deep learning systems by delivering high performance across image and video recognition tasks."

    "abstract": "Optical (OPT) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) cross-modal remote sensing image retrieval is a key technique for all-weather Earth observation. The enhancement of SAR image resolution has driven the development from conventional scene-level retrieval to object-level retrieval. Inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and cross-modal discrepancies are general challenges in cross-modal image retrieval. Although existing methods have attempted to address them at the scene level, these challenges persist in object-level tasks due to inherent limitations of the methods, such as detail loss caused by global pooling and insufficient local discrimination. To address this gap, a novel FGHN is proposed to enhance the retrieval accuracy. First, a focus-aware residual network is designed to highlight discriminative local features, facilitating the extraction of semantic details. Second, an intra-class feature aggregation loss is introduced to improve intra-class compactness, reinforcing the consistency of fine-grained representations. Finally, a distance enhanced weighting strategy is incorporated into the hash learning loss to promote similarity among hash codes of the same class. To support fine-grained OPT-SAR retrieval, we construct a High-Resolution OPT-SAR dataset, termed HROS. It is worth noting that the SAR images in HROS were collected by our team. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate both FGHN and HROS. The experimental results demonstrate that HROS exhibits high resolution, strong robustness, and superior differentiation, establishing it as a promising benchmark for OPT-SAR retrieval. FGHN achieves state-of-the-art performance on HROS, obtaining 89.80% mAP and 93.95% P@10 for OPT image retrieval with SAR queries at 32 bits hash code. Its strong generalization capability is further validated on the public CBRSIR VS dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the three innovative modules. Moreover, FGHN proves potential for large-scale remote sensing image retrieval applications."

It also provides a modular and reusable data collection framework that allows for replication in similarly emerging technical areas. The need for such a list and framework stems from the lack of formally defined educational standards for AI hardware. In the United States, the CHIPS and Science Act continues to fund ongoing efforts to bolster the next-generation engineering workforce with programs that aim to bridge the gap between education in academia and technical work in industry. Our framework is explicitly collaborative in that it facilitates interaction between subject matter experts in academia and industry. Its iterative nature provides consistent opportunities for continuous refinement. Educational standards most prevalent to AI hardware are primarily concentrated around five areas: 1) fundamental of AI hardware, 2) performance and power considerations, 3) industry applications and use cases, 4) hardware-software co-design, and 5) troubleshooting and debugging. Immediately, in providing this list of educational standards, engineering programs and instructors can more effectively evaluate the extent to which their courses currently cover the requirements and where they may need to create additional curricula. In providing this framework for generating educational standards, researchers are provided a flexible protocol to generate similar results - both for AI hardware and other contexts where widely agreed-upon educational standards are not yet standardized."

The rate of female students earning engineering degrees has steadily increased over the past few decades but has not yet reached the same level as male students. Understanding the factors that contribute to increased retention and success for female engineering students is crucial to help bridge this gap and improve representation for women in STEM. In undergraduate engineering classrooms, it is common to find female students sitting near each other, rather than evenly distributed, in male-dominated classrooms. Preliminary results indicate that sitting near other female-presenting students significantly increases the perceived performance, comfort, and participation for undergraduate female engineering students. This suggests that female engineering students benefit from sitting near other women, both in terms of classroom experience and academic achievement."

Satellite-based systems, while associated with higher initial deployment costs, provide consistent performance and the potential to extend connectivity to underserved and remote regions where terrestrial infrastructure is not economically feasible. Overall, the results underscore the need for a hybrid connectivity approach that combines terrestrial and satellite technologies, supported by targeted policies and investment strategies, to effectively address Zimbabwe's digital divide. Future work should focus on optimizing cost models, improving technology integration, and exploring innovative policy frameworks to ensure that universal, reliable, and affordable internet access becomes a reality across all regions of the country."

    "abstract": "Maintaining the performance of machine learning (ML) models amid evolving data distributions presents a considerable challenge in real-world applications. This paper introduces a framework that integrates model monitoring, intelligent data extraction, and efficient retraining strategies to address distribution shifts proactively. Continuous monitoring facilitates early detection of data drift and enables selective extraction of the most informative data for retraining, thereby reducing computational and storage requirements. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains high predictive accuracy while significantly decreasing both the volume of retraining data and the latency relative to conventional retraining methods."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have witnessed remarkable progress and widespread applications in recent years. Meanwhile, there is growing attention regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Existing attack methods for HGNNs generate perturbations to slightly modify the structure of a heterogeneous graph, thereby degrading the predictive performance of HGNNs on target nodes. However, to craft such a perturbation, these methods require solving a complicated optimization problem, which makes them computationally inefficient for launching attacks during the inference phase. In this work, we, therefore, introduce generative heterogeneous attack (GHAttack), a novel generative attack method for efficient and effective adversarial attacks on HGNNs. Specifically, GHAttack aims to train a perturbation generator, which produces a perturbation for each target node via a simple forward pass, while allowing the perturbation to modify edges on the heterogeneous relations of the graph to obtain high attack effectiveness. To achieve this, we design a novel model architecture for the generator, consisting of an HGNN backbone and a relation-aware output layer. We formulate the training of the generator as an optimization problem and efficiently solve it by addressing a series of technical challenges. Extensive experiments on ten representative HGNNs and six datasets verify the high efficiency and excellent effectiveness of GHAttack."

    "abstract": "Engineering students in India often hold negative perceptions of biology, especially those who did not study the subject in grades 11 and 12. Yet, biology is increasingly essential for addressing complex engineering challenges. In this study, we implemented an integrated, experiential teaching approach combining hands-on demonstrations, non-graded interactive assessments, and project-based learning through structured research writing module. The aim was to improve student engagement and reshape perceptions of biology through active learning. Shifts in student attitudes were tracked using surveys administered at the beginning and end of the course, based on a 5-point Likert scale. Initially, 75% of students viewed biology as overly reliant on memorization; by the end, this figure had dropped to 15%. Likewise, the proportion of students who believed biology could be approached logically and systematically—like mathematics or physics—increased by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 5 \\%}$</tex>. Despite these improvements in content perception, students' interest in pursuing biology-related majors or careers remained low. In fact, students appeared to shift from a favourable to a more cautious stance regarding biology as a career path. This shift could indicate that the increased clarity about the nature of biology through the course helped students make more informed decisions aligned with their existing interests in engineering. Overall, the findings suggest that this innovative research-based teaching approach can meaningfully improve how engineering students perceive biology."

    "abstract": "Communication via light, particularly light fidelity (LiFi), offers secure wireless connectivity that is free from radio frequency (RF) interference and enables dense spectrum reuse. This paper advances the modeling of the power consumption involved when using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as emitters. Many earlier publications assume that the electrical power con sumption of a LiFi emitter is proportional to the variance of the input signal, thus to the average of the square of the signal. This widely adopted model has proven to be problematic for several reasons. It implies a potential violation of the law of conservation of energy (LoCoE), overlooks the Shockley diode equation, and disregards the fundamental energy required to generate photons. Therefore, it often leads to inappropriate optimization designs as it assumes that electrical power consumption scales with signal variance. LiFi requires more accurate models to estimate its power consumption than those typically used in the literature. This work introduces a more realistic model. The electrical power consumed by an LED is, in reasonable approximation, proportional to the first moment of the non-negative signal or to the root-mean-square (RMS) standard deviation of the modulation signal. Our results align with the LoCoE, wall-plug efficiency, and the Shockley diode equation. These emphasize that photon generation depends on a relatively constant voltage rather than a voltage that scales linearly with the photon f lux. According to Planck's function, this voltage is linked to a wavelength-dependent constant. We explored counterintuitive consequences of this perspective in detail. Importantly, we show that when power for photon creation is modeled more accurately and applied to an intensity-modulated optical link, the optimal design strategies differ substantially from those derived from RF systems."

Depth sensing can be used to extract the torso surface area trend over time, which is the result of the breathing process. Movement artifacts still represent a major problem. In this paper, four subjects are asked to walk and breathe freely in a volume measurement. A commercial wearable chest strap is employed as a ground truth. Each subject pose is tracked by deep learning. Four regions of interest are evaluated for respiratory extraction: the entire torso, chest, abdomen, and chest centroid. To compensate for the effect of motion, the nose, the middle of the shoulder, and the abdomen are considered as possible movement reference points and subtracted from the signal extracted from the previously mentioned region of interest. The best results given by the chest area correspond to a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.958 bpm, a standard deviation (STD) of 2.132 bpm, and a Root Mean Square Value (RMSE) of 2.338 bpm."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition where individuals face challenges in neurological development and have verbal, non-verbal, learning and behavioral disorders. Even though this condition is identifiable in the first few years in the children's life, many remain undiagnosed until later. This leads to long term developmental issues and delayed interventions. This is what makes the early detection critical for improving development in children. Despite that, traditional diagnosis approaches like behavioral checklists and pre structured interviews rely on the clinician's expertise and are time consuming and have a risk of inconsistency. This study entails and addresses the above problem by proposing a machine learning based multi model to automate early detection in toddlers aged 12 to 36 months. In the initial stage, the traditional classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM are evaluated with high accuracy, F1 score. Then, hybrid models are developed by combining Gradient Boosting as the anchor model with other high performing algorithms, to overcome the limitation of single classification models. These hybrid models help to overcome the limitations of the individual classifiers. Finally, the best-performing hybrid model is enhanced further by Hyperparameter tuning, Feature selection and Cross validation. The outcome of this research will be a hybrid model, combining machine learning algorithms with the best scores, ensuring high accuracy and low false positives. This aims to help in the detection of ASD in early stages in toddlers."

    "abstract": "With the fast-paced development of cloud computing, there has been an increasing need of secure and efficient mechanisms for storing and processing sensitive data. Classic data-encryption methods, while offering relatively strong data protection, hinder the performance of computationally intensive advanced analytics and machine learning (ML) on encrypted data. This study advocates a privacy-preserving architecture that trades off between data security, computational performance, and ML compatibility in the cloud. The methodology involves splitting a document into chunks, creating message digests, and encrypting each chunk with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Replication by creating many encrypted copies is then implemented and stored on distributed servers for fault tolerance and lower access latency. The architecture is divided into three core modules: Client End, Master Server/Distributed Server, and Replication. As experimental results from Java technologies and MySQL show, encryption time increases with file size; however, chunking time remains fairly constant. Being replicated slightly raises the upload time but drastically reduces the download time, thus ensuring data reliability. Further, the design facilitates data protection laws like GDPR and HIPAA via strong access control systems. The architecture proposes further privacy and integrity enhancements with efficient ML processes such as homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and differential privacy. In general, this study provides strong evidence that chunk-level encryption, authentication, and replication based on ECC offer a scalable, secure, and efficient solution to the storage and processing of data in clouds with only minimal performance penalties. This makes it an operational framework for secured ML and cloud service models."

The system focuses on three primary modules: static and dynamic single-hand gesture recognition, dual-hand static gesture recognition, and an interactive user interface. Static gestures, covering 24 ASL alphabet letters (excluding $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$) and two functional commands (YES and NO), are classified using a fine-tuned VGG16 convolutional neural network, which achieved a validation accuracy of 92.17%. For dynamic gestures, specifically J and Z, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model processes landmark trajectories extracted via MediaPipe, achieving a validation accuracy of 91.67%. The dual-hand recognition component, trained separately using the same CNN architecture, accurately detects more complex gestures such as the word “book.” All models are integrated into a multithreaded Python-based user interface that supports live video input, on-screen gesture tracking, dynamic gesture triggering, and buffered text output. Testing results show high classification accuracy across all gesture categories, with real-time performance and consistent recognition even under variable lighting and hand positions. Overall, the system demonstrates a scalable and accessible approach to gesture-based interaction, providing foundational work for future integration with robotic systems or service-oriented applications for deaf and mute users."

The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to show the custom development of an AI-Chatbot for learning applications while focusing on character development, (2) to evaluate the adoption of an AI chatbot to serve as a surrogate for a real-world professional interaction in both a technical and social context. The custombuilt chatbot was integrated into a role-playing scenario where students take on the role of consulting engineers tasked with reviewing the contractor's project for compliance. The project involves verifying the visual notification devices (strobes) of a fire alarm system. Appliance settings, allocations, and specifications must comply with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code. Code violations were intentionally added on-site for the students to identify. Students were prompted to confront the chatbot regarding these violations, which is programmed to avoid extra costs and deny responsibility. The chatbot leveraged realistic interactions to challenge students in identifying and addressing ethical dilemmas. Insights into student learning gains and character development are gathered through a survey and evaluations of student work. Further, this scenario conflicts between safety compliance and project constraints, including schedules and budgets. Through post-activity surveys, we found that students reported significantly strengthened commitments to safety, greater confidence in speaking up, and a deeper understanding of ethical responsibilities. The results suggest that AI-driven role-play can effectively cultivate integrity and other character virtues alongside technical competencies."

Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) inhibitors are biomolecules that offer potential as novel anticancer therapies. The conventional development of therapeutic drugs for cancer faces significant challenges due to the high average cost, and an alternative solution is the use of Machine Learning. This study proposes a deep learning approach using a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) optimized with the Monarch Butterfly Optimization (MBO) algorithm to predict the activity of MMP-9 inhibitor compounds. The dataset consisted of 1,123 samples classified based on pIC50 values. Three baseline 1D-CNN architectures were evaluated and subsequently optimized through MBO with varying population sizes. The results demonstrate that deeper CNN architectures improve classification performance, while MBO significantly enhances convergence and accuracy. Among the optimization schemes, the third scheme, using a population size of 25, achieved the highest test accuracy of 0.7747 and F1-score of 0.7744, indicating superior generalization. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining 1D-CNN and MBO for efficient and accurate anticancer compound prediction."

    "abstract": "Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a standard method in reliability engineering to model causes of system failures. While Static Fault Trees (SFTs) capture logical dependencies, they cannot represent time-dependent or sequential failure behavior. Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs) overcome this limitation but are still constructed manually using expert knowledge, limiting their use in data-driven applications. This paper presents a method for automatically learning DFTs from temporal event data. We extend the LIFT algorithm with support for dynamic gates (PAND, SEQ) and use the PAMH test to evaluate statistical associations between event combinations and their parent, while a Chi-square test distinguishes between SEQ and PAND gates based on the frequency of order violations. The result is an interpretable model that captures both structural and temporal failure logic. We evaluate the method on synthetic datasets generated from a manually constructed DFT designed by a domain expert, with varying levels of noise and event frequencies. The learned DFTs show high predictive and structural accuracy under ideal conditions and remain robust under noise with appropriate parameter tuning. This demonstrates the potential of the approach for interpretable failure prediction in intelligent manufacturing systems."

    "abstract": "Especially in Indonesia, universities are required to guarantee that prospective students accepted into the university will graduate on time. This means that prospective students accepted into a university must be guaranteed to be able to follow lectures well and graduate. Of course, more effort is needed to achieve this, beyond simply accepting students and completing them. This study is a follow-up study in order to build a fuzzy logic-based decision model to predict the academic success of student candidates, specifically in the Informatics Engineering department. The decision model combines five main parameters—math scores, computer based writing test (CBWT) scores, programming skills, motivation, and discipline—while synthetic data is generated using Monte Carlo simulations to represent candidate characteristics. The main method used in building the model is fuzzy logic. This study will explain the design of the model in more detail. By using an object-oriented approach (with three types of tools: object, activity, and usecase diagrams), the decision model can be clearly explained, so that readers can see the details of the decision model. The decision model itself is developed using the Python language. Simulation results show the predicted average score of 72.93 with a deviation of 8.32. This model can ultimately be used as an alternative model for assessing prospective students recruited by universities, particularly in the Informatics Engineering department."

This research constructs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-driven dynamic weight adjustment framework, employing the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm to dynamically adjust sensor fusion weights based on real-time perceived EMI intensity. A multi-objective reward function incorporating signal fidelity, system latency, and energy consumption is designed to synergistically optimise the fusion strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that under dynamic electromagnetic interference ranging from 20 to 200 V/m, the system maintains an accuracy rate exceeding 98.47%. Its Composite Performance Index (CPI) score reaches 95.22, representing a significant improvement over Transformer and Kalman filter models. The approach exhibits distinct advantages in disturbance resistance and stability, offering a novel technical pathway for intelligent monitoring in complex industrial environments."

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress innovative-practice paper describes the ongoing effort to enhance student engagement and real-world relevance of course learning activities through the incorporation of scenario-based projects that afford students the opportunity to collaborate across different courses within the same or related STEM degree programs in an asynchronous, fully remote online-learning setting. By allowing a select number of students from different courses within the uncrewed and autonomous systems field to work collaboratively on comprehensive scenario-based projects in fulfillment of their course learning requirements, students get the opportunity to investigate problems from multiple angles, thereby increasing the relevance of learning activities to the students as well as enhancing the applicability of the project work to the real world. Furthermore, in alignment with and application of adult and constructivist learning theories, by repeatedly engaging with and revisiting relevant industry- and peer-generated problems in multiple courses throughout their degree program, students may gain a deeper understanding of interrelated issues and better comprehend the applicability of their generated solutions. Therefore, they get more invested in their projects and the associated learning processes. Thus, in short, the approaches presented in this paper may help to overcome the fire-and-forget mentality often associated with student assignments, especially in a fully online learning environment. Following a handful of past pilot projects that are also discussed in the paper, the presented work in progress is based on the ongoing development, implementation, and testing of a newly created remote sensing and data analysis course, with a focus on describing the learning activity design and logistic requirements for the course rollout that enable the beforementioned collaboration with students in other existing courses on a comprehensive real-world-application project. Preliminary lessons learned and requirements for scalability and transferability are discussed, and the intended research methodology for the work in progress is presented. A vision to expand opportunities for students to collaborate and build on each other's work across multiple courses is also introduced. The ongoing work discussed in this paper represents a further step in enhancing the online learning environment with meaningful activity design and may inspire readers to adopt similar innovative approaches in their own course developments and facilitations."

In Indonesia, a substantial amount of satellite and remote sensing data remains underutilized due to fragmented storage, limited cataloging, and lack of processing infrastructure. To address this, we introduce GeoMIMO (Geoinformatics Multi Input Multi Output), a modular, open-source platform that leverages High-Performance Computing (HPC) to automate workflows from ingestion to analysis-ready data (ARD) and dissemination. GeoMIMO integrates open standards including SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), Open Data Cube (ODC), and GeoNode, and supports multiple input sources (Sentinel-1/2, Landsat, field data) and output formats (GeoTIFF, Shapefile, CSV, APIs). Stakeholder needs were gathered through a national survey and directly shaped the platform’s architecture and features. A prototype deployed on BRIN’s Mahameru HPC validates core functionality, including plugin-based ingestion, ARD generation, and interactive dashboards. Early feedback confirms strong alignment with stakeholder requirements. Future work includes pipeline optimization, broader tool integration (e.g., QGIS, GEE), and preparing for national-scale deployment."

Nevertheless, this shift to digital transformations also leaves critical weaknesses when it comes to the security of sensitive medical information and other devices. This study proposes a multi-layered robust authorization and authentication system that is precisely developed to fit in IoT-driven smart health care architectures. The system incorporates the principles of the blockchain access validation, biometric-enhanced identity identification, dynamic role-based access control (RBAC), and zero-trust architecture to protect data confidentiality and device integrity. The provided model uses a low weight encryption layer that fits the constrained IoT medical devices strategically to be secured and low latency. The adaptive layer of intelligence is the context-aware access policies as well as anomaly detection mechanisms, which dynamically blocks events of unauthorized or suspected access. Moreover, the system incorporates federated authentication so that decentralized access to various institutions is managed without affecting the privacy of the data. The simulations on a real-time healthcare IoT network have a high resistance to impersonation, data leakage, and unauthorized access. The proposed model has shown dramatic improvement over the traditional single-layer access control systems on detection accuracy, access latency, and success rate of authentication. The architecture has a powerful basis using which next-generation smart healthcare can be developed in hospitals and clinics and even in remote patient monitoring systems found to be scalable and secured. The proposed system surpassed others as the best with the highest accuracy of 96.1% in authentication."

Manual inspection, however, is limited by variability and low reliability. This study applies deep learning as an intelligent tool to enhance inspection accuracy. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ResNet50 architectures were implemented for surface defect detection across six classes, crack, dust spot, oil stain, thin spot, unsanded board, and good quality with 1,800 images collected and preprocessed using augmentation. The ResNet50 model achieved 91.67% accuracy, outperforming the baseline CNN. Precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeded 0.85 across most classes, while the confusion matrix showed only minor misclassifications between good and visually similar defects. Confidence scores above 0.90 confirmed model reliability. These findings demonstrate that deep learning can strengthen quality inspection, reduce human error, and accelerate decision-making. The proposed approach aligns with AI-driven quality control and contributes to the realization of ZDM in wood-based manufacturing."

    "abstract": "Many regional languages in Indonesia are at risk of extinction due to limited digital resources. Most research in machine translation focuses on major languages, leaving regional low-resource languages underrepresented. This study proposes a conceptual design of a translator that integrates dictionary-based and corpus-based approaches. Using a descriptive-qualitative method through literature review, it analyzes prior works on bilingual dictionaries, corpora, and hybrid translation systems. The proposed design consists of three components: a bilingual dictionary to provide word equivalents, a corpus to capture contextual meaning, and data augmentation techniques such as paraphrasing and back-translation to expand limited datasets. The expected result is a translation model that achieves better performance than using only dictionary or corpus approaches. Dictionary-based methods handle basic vocabulary but often lose contextual meaning, while corpus-based methods help interpret idioms, cultural nuances, and polysemy. Evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and TER will measure translation quality. This research contributes a framework for developing effective translation systems for regional languages with limited data and aims to implement it as a user-friendly, web-based application accessible to the public."

Using forecasts, enterprises can tailor their production processes to fulfill demand and ensure products reach consumers on schedule. The purpose of this study is to forecast the dynamics of the pig population for 24 months. Three methods were used for this type of analysis, involving autoregression and a probabilistic time series approach. The dataset provides monthly figures on the pig population, encompassing mean, variability (standard deviation), range (min and max), and distribution characteristics (skewness and kurtosis). The dynamics of changes in the pig population in the period from 2008 to 2024 are illustrated. Forecasted values are compared with the actual values, which is illustrated in the graphs. Estimates of RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and MASE are given for forecast periods of $\\mathbf{2 4}$ months. By comparing these estimates for different models, the best model for forecasting the pig population was determined. This study enables farms and industry enterprises to estimate the potential volume of products that can be harvested or obtained in the future. It supports informed management decisions such as planning resource needs, improving efficiency, increasing profitability, reducing costs, and adapting to market changes."

    "abstract": "As core counts in System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures continue to rise, Network-on-Chip (NoC) faces growing challenges in maintaining low-latency, energy-efficient communication. Wireless Network-on-Chip (WiNoC) has emerged as a promising solution by integrating wireless links with traditional wired mesh networks, enabling single-hop long-range communication. However, with limited wireless bandwidth and nonuniform traffic patterns, WiNoC systems are prone to wireless congestion and inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a Load Balanced Congestion Aware Routing Algorithm for WiNoC (LCRAW) that addresses these issues by dynamically balancing traffic between the wired and wireless layers of the hybrid WiNoC architecture. The algorithm dynamically distributes packets between lower-wired paths and upper-layer wireless paths. The wired mesh network is partitioned into small subnets, and source-to-destination distance guides optimal path selection. By monitoring network load conditions, LCRAW adaptively reduces congestion risk in both layers and improves overall throughput. Simulation results using synthetic traffic patterns on the Noxim cycle-accurate simulator show that LCRAW, compared to XY and Latency-Tolerant Congestion-Aware (LTCA) routing, improves throughput by up to 14% and 9%, reduces latency by 19% and 12%, and decreases energy consumption by 13% and 10%, respectively. The proposed technique improves overall system performance and ensures maximum utilization of wireless resources in WiNoC architectures."

Traditional mask detection systems typically perform binary classification, identifying only \"with mask\" or \"without mask\", and fail to detect improperly worn masks, which pose significant health risks. This study presents a deep learning-based framework using YOLOv8 for multi-class face mask detection, distinguishing between properly worn masks, improperly worn masks, and no masks. A publicly available dataset containing 3,000 images evenly distributed across the three classes was preprocessed and augmented with rotation, blur, and occlusion to improve robustness.

Experimental results demonstrated a top-1 validation accuracy of 99.5% and per-class F1-scores exceeding 98%, confirming reliable classification across all mask categories. Inference speed tests highlight YOLOv8’s suitability for real-time deployment, including on resource-constrained edge devices such as CCTV systems and embedded modules.

This paper presents an anatomy-aware control framework for teleoperated lung ultrasound. Leveraging biomechanically accurate 3D modelling, the system applies virtual constraints on the ultrasound probe pose and provides real-time visual feedback to assist in precise probe placement tasks. A twofold evaluation, one with 5 naïve operators on a single volunteer and the second with a single experienced operator on 6 volunteers, compared our method with a standard teleoperation baseline. The results of the first one characterised the accuracy of the anatomical model and the improved perceived performance by the naïve operators, while the second one focused on the efficiency of the system in improving probe placement and reducing procedure time compared to traditional teleoperation. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the physician's capabilities in executing remote lung ultrasound, reducing more than 20% of execution time on 4-point acquisitions, towards faster, more objective and repeatable exams."

    "abstract": "Rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA’s capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR."

    "abstract": "This innovative practice WIP paper describes the challenges caused by use of AI tools in the classroom. Since the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, Meta Llama 3, Mistral AI, GPT-4o, etc.) [1] into academia, many students have openly embraced these tools to help them progress in their courses. This has prompted concerns from faculty regarding the maintenance of academic integrity. Despite these concerns, new AI tools continue to be developed, and students are rapidly outpacing faculty in their adoption and use of these tools [2]. This trend suggests that AI is not a passing phenomenon, particularly in educational settings. To understand how students can use AI tools to complete assignments, instructors must recognize how these tools can be misused. Computer Science instructors need to understand how assignments can be presented to AI tools and the types of responses these tools generate. This paper examines the ways students can use AI tools to produce responses that could be submitted as class assignments and compares these results to solutions generated by human authors or instructors. Additionally, the paper recommends strategies for creating assignments that are more likely to be solved by students than by AI tools. Using this knowledge, instructors can be more confident that assigned work will be completed by their students."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel asymmetric V-type variable flux memory (VFM) machine featuring a hybrid-layer permanent magnet (PM) structure is proposed. This design incorporates two PM arrangements within each pole: one part employs a single-layer variable PM (VPM), while the other part features a dual-layer PM arrangement consisting of a constant PM (CPM) and a VPM. The proposed machine, along with two existing machine topologies: a symmetrical single-layer VFM machine and an asymmetric single-layer VFM machine, is optimized using finite element method with the same stator, rotor diameter, and total PM usage. The electromagnetic performance of the optimized designs for all three machines is investigated and compared. It shows that the asymmetric design can mitigate the intrapolar cross-coupling effect between the CPMs and VPMs found in the symmetrical VFM machine, thereby delivering higher torque output. Furthermore, compared to the asymmetric single-layer VFM machine, the proposed machine can achieve wider flux regulation range and improved overall efficiency due to the series-parallel magnetic circuit enabled by the hybrid-layer structure. Finally, a prototype of the proposed machine is fabricated and tested for validation."

    "abstract": "Single-phase permanent magnet reluctance motors (PMRMs) have attracted much attention because they combine the advantages of the low cost and simple structure of reluctance motor (RM) with high power density characteristics of permanent magnet (PM) motors. However, the unique topology makes them vulnerable to significant vibrations and noises in actual operation, limiting the potential of PMRM in a wider range of application scenarios. This article first investigates the electromagnetic vibration characteristics of single-phase PMRM. A general analytical model of radial force considering the stator and rotor slots is established to reveal the general principle of radial force frequency distribution of single-phase PMRM. Finite element analysis (FEA) models of different rotor structures are established to verify the theoretical derivation. The results show that the harmonic amplitude of the radial force is closely related to the odd-even nature of the time-frequency orders. Finally, a prototype was fabricated and experimentally tested for vibration and acoustic noise at different speeds under no-load and load conditions. The segmented rotor structure demonstrates its potential in suppressing low-frequency vibrations."

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress paper examines the educational impact of a keynote presentation delivered by Dr. Victor Hugo Minces at the California Association of Science Educators (CASE) Conference and explores its implications for engineering education. While experiential and hands-on learning are well-established as effective pedagogical strategies in STEM, such practices are seldom modeled in professional development events like keynotes, which typically favor lecture-based formats. In front of an audience of 500 educators, Dr. Minces transformed a conventional keynote into an interactive and immersive experience by guiding participants through collaborative soundmaking activities using everyday objects. Rooted in the Listening to Waves program-which introduces children to STEM concepts through music-the presentation integrated principles of sound, vibration, signal processing, and computer science. Participants experienced these STEM ideas through playful, embodied engagement, illustrating how artistic and multisensory approaches can make complex content more accessible and memorable. Post-session survey data was collected to assess participant engagement and perceptions of the session's educational value. Quantitative results indicated high intellectual engagement, while qualitative feedback emphasized the session's interactivity, relevance, and enjoyment. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on multimodal learning, embodied cognition, and active STEM pedagogy. Preliminary findings suggest that such experiential approaches can be successfully scaled to large-group settings, with potential applications in both <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{K}-12$</tex> and higher education.

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of anomalies in medical images is critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Although recent vision-language frameworks such as MediCLIP have shown promise in few-shot settings, they often suffer from limited domain specificity and reduced localization accuracy when applied to heterogeneous medical data. In this work, we propose a fully supervised anomaly segmentation framework that integrates learnable text prompts with a novel Organic Spatial Attention Adapter. Unlike the baseline adapter in MediCLIP, our design employs an Inter-Layer Gated Fusion mechanism to adaptively integrate semantic features from different transformer depths, combined with a lightweight spatial attention module to enhance the localization of fine-grained abnormalities. The adapter also includes a target channel projection for downstream compatibility and residual normalization to ensure stable training. Leveraging curated prompt sets of normal and abnormal anatomical concepts, the model aligns multimodal embeddings for robust anomaly detection. Experiments on the BMAD benchmark—covering BraTS2021, BTCV+LiTs, and RESC datasets—demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image-level AUROC (I-AUROC) and pixel-level AUROC (P-AUROC), with notable improvements in pixel-level localization accuracy. These results validate the effectiveness of our architecture in enhancing domain adaptation and anomaly segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities."

Parallax can generate honeypot clones of any live LAMP stack, without interfering with the availability of the web application, and deploys the clones alongside the original web application. In the Parallax-based network deployment, all attackers are seamlessly and covertly redirected to the honeypot clone, while benign visitors may continue their interaction with the original web application, same as before. Alongside Parallax, we introduce three independent sensitive data detection schemes, which we employ to isolate and replace the sensitive data of the original web application on the honeypot clone. As we allow attackers full interaction with all parts of the honeypot clone, we replace the sensitive data on the honeypot with realistic, context-aware, synthetic data using an LLM to ensure that none of the sensitive data of the original web application are compromised by attackers. To evaluate Parallax, we deploy it in the wild for five open-source web applications, and we examine the honeypot generation and deployment performance, as well as the interaction of attackers with the honeypot clones. Lastly, to evaluate the deceptive capability of the synthetically generated data, we conduct a large-scale user study and evaluate how well humans are able to differentiate between real and synthetic sensitive data."

The present investigation puts forward an Embedded Convolutional Neural infrastructure (CNN)-Based AI System for the real-time detection and forecasting of an air quality level that is envisioned to work efficiently on the edge devices that are resource-constrained. The system uses embedded AI architecture to process environmental sensor data locally, thus making it possible to quickly and in an energyefficient manner evaluate air quality without the use of the cloud. The heart of the system is a compact and lean CNN model trained on a variety of air quality datasets collected from a number of different sources and capable of identifying the complex patterns and spatial interdependencies among the polluting elements such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and O3. Data preprocessing of input quality is done through a noise reduction and normalization techniques, while the feature extraction that is carried out within the CNN enhances the prediction accuracy. The embedded platform further includes a real-time inference engine to constantly give the air quality monitor levels and trends. The proposed system outlines a number of significant parts including: (i) a compact CNN model restructured for edge computing; (ii) pollution level predictions with high accuracy in the real-time period; and (iii) an energysaving embedded deployment allowing continuous environmental surveillance in the city."

Identification of unknown devices is a key challenge for radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) in open-set scenarios, the similarity of device hardware characteristics further exacerbates the difficulty of the task. This paper proposes an open-set RFF recognition framework called SV-NPR (Siamese VGG16 with Negative Prototype Rejection). The framework combines the advantages of the VGG16 network in local feature extraction with the contrastive learning mechanism of the siamese network, and can efficiently capture the distribution of local detail features in RF signals. In addition, the introduction of a dynamic rejection mechanism based on negative prototypes improves the robustness and generalization ability of the model for unknown categories. Experimental results show that SV-NPR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Oracle dataset and exhibits leading recognition capabilities in open-set scenarios."

This challenge is specifically crucial for Urdu, a low-resource language with limited datasets and NLP tools. To deal with this gap, we employed the Urdu Human and AI text (UHAT) dataset and performed a comparative study of deep learning and transformer-based models for binary classification. Conventional sequence models, such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU with Word2Vec and FastText embeddings, had been benchmarked in opposition to pretrained transformers including BERT, mBERT, UrduBERT, and DistilBERT etc. Experimental outcomes show that transformer models significantly outperform recurrent architectures. Among them, multilingual BERT (mBERT) achieved the best performance with 91.67% accuracy and F1-score, surpassing UrduBERT and previous benchmarks like XLM-RoBERTa on the HLU corpus. These findings set up strong baseline results for Urdu AI-text detection and underscore the potential of multilingual transformers in low-resource settings."

    "abstract": "The extreme and uncertain underwater environment presents significant challenges in achieving reliable acoustic communications, mainly due to limited bandwidth and time variability. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel multiple-access technique for downlink multiuser networks, called Orthogonal Signal Division Multiple Access (OSDMA), which enables simultaneous transmission of different data streams from a single transmitter to the corresponding receivers/users by modulating the streams with an orthogonal Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) matrix. In a low-noise environment, each receiver/user can accurately estimate the channel and demodulate the data. Emulations and simulations are conducted based on at-sea channel measurements. The results show that OSDMA offers greater robustness against underwater time-varying channels than Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)."

Temperature sensors integrated into flexible skin can help regulate and optimize coolant consumption. However, it is often difficult to obtain strain-insensitive temperature measurements under multidirectional deformations of flexible skin. Therefore, this study investigates a novel multidirectional strain-insensitive stretchable temperature sensor (STS) based on a hexagram structure. A sensor prototype was fabricated with a measurement range of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$200~^{\\circ }$ </tex-math></inline-formula>C and a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 0.30%/°C. Furthermore, it achieved hysteresis and repeatability errors of 0.83% and 1.79%, respectively. The proposed sensor exhibited a resistance variation of less than 1% under a multidirectional uniaxial tensile strain of 0%–80%, indicating its effective strain decoupling capability. Finally, real-time surface temperature distribution detection was successfully achieved under a heat flux of 202 kW/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> by integrating the sensor array on an active thermal protection flexible skin, demonstrating the potential application of morphing high-speed vehicles."

This paper reviews ten engineering education studies that employed MMR designs, identifying common challenges and highlighting exemplar cases. It advocates for greater methodological rigor in conceptualizing, conducting, and reporting MMR in engineering education research. Our review revealed limited data integration, vague rationales and inconsistent methodological rigor, indicating the need for standardized frameworks and clear reporting to strengthen MMR quality and impact.

    "abstract": "This full paper in the innovative practice category presents a novel experimental study on introducing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a data privacy and security to pre-college learners using an experiential learning approach, that includes hands-on case studies and engaging activities. While browsing online, today's pre-college youth encounter data privacy related consent queries on a regular basis through explicit opt-in and opt-out procedures, which fall under the GDPR jurisdiction. These young online users, who regularly consume web contents, including social media, need to deal with data privacy related disclaimers plus clauses, as posted by technology service providers, who are required to do so to align with the GDPR requirements. With the emergence of GDPR as a major international data privacy law regulating user data, there is a need for these young, naive minds to develop basic awareness of GDPR in order to avoid getting exposed. Existing literature shows that there have been very limited studies on introducing GDPR at the preuniversity level, and this work is intended to address this research gap. This paper describes our nifty introductory GDPR lesson plan, and discusses how we have successfully offered this lesson plan over the last few years for cybersecurity education and outreach primarily at the high school level to develop GDPR awareness and understanding in pre-university students. Over the last few years, we have surveyed several high school community members, consisting of both students and teachers, who have taken part in our GDPR lesson offering, as part of our cybersecurity training camps and outreach workshop sessions. These participants have benefited from our GDPR activities, which include real-life scenario-based case studies, a GDPR enforcement tracker exercise, and a GDPR compliance based game, in terms of learning, and developing concepts, awareness plus interest in data privacy and data security topics. This paper shares and analyzes the preliminary data collected from all these survey responses to evaluate the prospects of our unique GDPR lesson plan as a potential educational and outreach tool for successfully engaging pre-college learners, for teaching data privacy plus data security notions, and for creating awareness plus interest in cybersecurity. To our knowledge, this experimental study using an introductory GDPR lesson plan, as presented in this paper, is a first of its kind research instance involving pre-university students at high school level."

However, vision approaches compatible with time-consuming image processing adopt low 60 Hz location sampling rate (frame rate) for real-time hand gesture recognition. Furthermore, they are not suitable for low-light environment and long detection range. In this paper, we propose RoFin, which first exploits 6 temporal-spatial 2D rolling fingertips for real-time 3D reconstructing of 20-joint hand pose. RoFin designs active optical labeling for finger identification and enhances inside-frame 3D location tracking via high rolling shutter rate (5-8  kHz). These features enable great potentials for enhanced multi-user HCI, virtual writing for Parkinson suffers, etc. We implement RoFin prototypes with wearable gloves attached with low-power single-colored LED nodes and commercial cameras. The experiment results show that (1) In flexible sensing distances up to 2.5 m, RoFin achieves an average labeling parsing accuracy of 85%, (2) In comparison to vision-based techniques, RoFin improves the tracking grain with 4× more sampled points each frame, (3) RoFin reconstructs a hand pose in real time with 16 mm mean deviation error compared with Leap Motion under flexible distance, and (4) we further investigated real-world applications of RoFin, such as air writing with smoothed trajectories and mobile-based letter/number recognition in our developed <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Xamera</i> app."

These environments provide unique affordances for creating immersive learning experiences that exceed the capabilities of other online learning platforms. They are particularly valuable for engineering and computing education, where abstract concepts often present significant learning challenges. Given this potential for technical education, this study investigates two key questions: how experienced educators structure learning activities in DVWs and what teaching strategies best leverage the unique affordances of DVWs for learning. To answer these questions, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 educators from the Virtual World Education Consortium with extensive teaching experience in DVWs. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis focusing on identifying teaching strategies and implementation approaches that could be adapted for computing and engineering educational contexts. Our analysis identified ten successful teaching strategies across three categories: Experiential Learning Strategies (including scenario-based learning and scale manipulation); Active Learning & Constructivist Strategies (such as spatial co-presence learning and structured exploration); and Social Learning & Community Strategies (featuring character-mediated instruction and multiuniversity collaborations). These strategies leverage unique capabilities of DVWs to implement approaches that would be difficult or impossible in physical or other online environments. The findings provide practical guidance for educators without prior DVW experience and those seeking to implement DVW teaching in computing and engineering disciplines. The identified strategies demonstrate how virtual environments can enhance conceptual understanding of complex technical subjects, create authentic problem-solving contexts, and facilitate engagement through diverse activities, enhancing student learning experiences."

The AF-SICL and the stacked patch are tightly integrated to achieve subarray sequential rotation structure with unequally spaced elements, combined with an unequal amplitude feed network with a large power division ratio contributing to reducing transmission loss and achieving a compact structure. The AF-SICL comparator network can achieve stable amplitude and phase correspondence for dual-CP antenna array. Moreover, a physical prototype of an 8×8 monopulse array antenna has been designed and fabricated. The measured results indicate that the sum and difference ports of the antenna array achieve excellent impedance bandwidth within the 8.7% (2.2-2.4 GHz), axial ratio lower than 0.3 dB, a peak gain of 23.45 dBi and the peak total efficiency is 70.2%. The symmetrical radiation pattern with a null depth less than -32.2 dB and the sidelobe levels of the sum and difference beams are suppresd to -16.2 dB and -16.1 dB respectively. The proposed monopulse array antenna holds great potential for high-precision, long-range target localization and tracking."

    "abstract": "The main thing that makes data transmission function in a dynamic network is dependable routing. Strong algorithms that can handle changes in network conditions are needed to make sure that data packets are sent quickly. This flexibility not only improves performance but also lowers the chance of losing data while it is being sent. Routing protocols use diverse methods, but without them, data can't be sent from one place to another. Multipath routing introduces the notion of load balancing; nevertheless, it fails to effectively disperse the load across the network, resulting in packet loss that impacts the essential communication resource, energy. This study suggests a routing protocol based on machine learning (MLRP) to manage strong flooding and make routing in MANET better. The reason we are motivated is that most multipath routing protocols are simply dependent on one thing, like the quickest path with a balanced load or energy conservation. The suggested plan looks at energy efficiency, the shortest way, and load balancing to make multipath routing protocols work better. In MLRP, you need to think about both the ML rules for moving data and how to keep congestion down by using several paths in MANET. The resource-like bandwidth influence tells us what is going on with the floods. Flooding data packets slows down performance, but the suggested MLRP controls it well, which cuts down on data loss and overhead. We look at how well flooding, FLBB, and the projected MLRP work. The suggested plan is working well and keeping traffic from being too heavy. The performance reveals that PDR and throughput have improved by at least 6%, which means that there is reduced overhead latency and dropping in the network."

    "abstract": "In STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) education, there has been a burgeoning interest in the significance of care and compassion in shaping aspiring professionals. Prevalent approaches to compassion-oriented STEM education frequently emphasize imparting practical techniques (such as listening skills) or theories (like the human capabilities approach) related to engineering design and decision-making in individual courses. While these approaches offer valuable insights and contributions, they also encounter certain challenges and opportunities for further improvement. This work-in-progress paper aims to review existing literature on the role of compassion in STEM education, guided by the following questions: (1) How do scholars and educators in STEM education justify the need and value of compassion in the field? (2) How do they conceptualize compassion in relation to similar concepts such as empathy? (3) What approaches and strategies have they used to cultivate compassion in STEM education? The findings from this review provide valuable insights for a larger project focused on creating institutional impact by developing communities of practice for STEM faculty committed to fostering compassionate learning environments in their classrooms."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test skeletonsstructural templates that outline unit test coverage without implementing full test logic. Test skeletons are especially important in test-driven development (TDD), where they provide an early framework for systematic verification. Traditionally authored manually, their creation can be timeconsuming and error-prone, particularly in educational or large-scale development settings. We evaluate four LLMs-GPT-4, DeepSeek-Chat, Llama4-Maverick, and Gemma2-9Bon their ability to generate RSpec skeletons for a real-world Ruby class developed in a university software engineering course. Each model's output is assessed using static analysis and a blind expert review to measure structural correctness, clarity, maintainability, and conformance to testing best practices. The study reveals key differences in how models interpret code structure and testing conventions, offering insights into the practical challenges of using LLMs for automated test scaffolding. Our results show that DeepSeek generated the most maintainable and well-structured skeletons, while GPT-4 produced more complete but conventionally inconsistent output. The study reveals prompt design and contextual input as key quality factors."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "To overcome the challenges posed by domain shift in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, methods based on domain adaptation (DA) have been widely used. Currently, most HSI DA methods focus on designing complex strategies to align the distributions of the source domain (SD) and the target domain (TD) in the feature space after feature extraction, yielding promising results. However, when there exists a large domain shift between SD and TD, it becomes challenging to map them into the same feature space. In this article, we propose the bidirectional mamba and domain mixing network (BMDMnet). Since pure CNN architectures are constrained in local feature extraction, while transformer-based models improve global feature capturing capability at the cost of high computational complexity, we propose the bidirectional mamba module (BMM) as an efficient solution for capturing long-range dependencies. In addition, a self-distillation strategy is employed during training. By utilizing a more stable teacher model, reliable predictions can be obtained in the TD. Subsequently, a domain mixing supervised learning (DMSL) module is designed, which creates a mixed domain by selecting low-entropy sample-pseudo-label pairs from the TD and randomly combining them with sample-label pairs from the SD. DMSL aims to introduce mixed domain to mitigate the inter-domain gap in the data space, thereby enabling the model to learn TD representations more effectively. Experiments demonstrate that BMDMnet outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms across three cross-scene datasets."

The approach significantly elevates the scope of the course by radically reducing the need for detailed supporting instruction on tools, languages, and syntax. A class of professional students with little or no programming or modeling experience was enabled to utilize modeling and simulation to address a real-world systems engineering challenge. Results indicate that student performance far exceeded what was achievable in the past using standard engineering approaches, with dramatically increased willingness and capability to apply modeling and simulation in professional practice. The success of this approach and lessons learned will inform the redesign of other courses in the systems engineering master's program, with potential implications for engineering education more broadly."

An analytical expression is derived for the probability of attack detection by legitimate users. It is shown that increasing the number of eavesdroppers in the quantum channel leads to a higher probability of attack detection. Expressions are also obtained for the maximum amount of information that two eavesdroppers can gain during their sequential passive attack. The analysis demonstrates that the ping-pong protocol with GHZ triplets is no more vulnerable to passive eavesdropping by two adversaries than it is to an attack by a single one. The results can be generalized to ping-pong protocols based on n-qubit GHZ states for arbitrary values of $\\boldsymbol{n}$."

Each delivery is authenticated using a per-trip ephemeral secret derived via Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE), ensuring secure and isolated authentication. Trust scores are computed using a balanced combination of checkpoint-derived metrics and customer ratings, stored immutably on Ethereum smart contracts. Simulation results across 300+ delivery trips demonstrated that the framework supports transparent, scalable, and fault-resilient trust evaluation, with stable gas costs and responsive score updates under varying operational conditions. The system provides a practical foundation for decentralized reputation management in high-integrity logistics environments."

There have been multiple studies done on what programming language is best to start with, and many have selected Python as their selection as a programming language for beginners. One area that has not been widely studied is the learning of Python, or coding in general, by neurodivergent populations. This includes the benefits a neurodivergent learner may glean from learning Python as well as the challenges they may encounter - anything which makes their experience different from that of a neurotypical Python beginner. Resources were pulled together on neurodivergence, focusing on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Python as a beginner language, and how it may uniquely benefit or challenge those who are ADHD, autistic, or both. For this literature review, outcomes for which data was sought included cognitive challenges neurodivergent individuals may face, ways in which the neurodivergent brain may be wellsuited to learn Python, and ways in which neurodivergent populations may benefit from learning Python. Python's unique attributes, including its simplicity, readability, and structured environment, make it an effective tool for neurodivergent learners. Future research should aim to expand the body of knowledge by conducting empirical studies that directly investigate the experiences of neurodivergent learners."

Concept graphs play a central role in modern intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), as they organize domain knowledge and support the tracking of student progress while enabling personalized and adaptive learning pathways or recommendations. Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract concept maps, but the generalized nature of LLM training introduces challenges such as hallucinations, mathematical errors, and biases, leading to uncertainty in their outputs. To address these limitations, this study integrates retrieval-augmented generati6ton (RAG)-based techniques with LLMs including Gemini-1.5-flash and Gemma-3. We integrated these models with classical machine learning methods and evaluated our RAG-LLM framework using referencefree verification through multiple benchmarking methods, ensuring reliability and reducing uncertainty in the generated concept graphs. We have been employing CS2-DS as an example to investigate the efficacy of the RAG-based AI-driven ensemble approach. Our preliminary findings indicate good evaluation scores on the following test cases: relevance of answers, context faithfulness, context precision, and context recall. Further systematic investigation will focus on refining and evaluating the use of the framework and comparing different models and fine-tuning techniques."

Using open-ended peer evaluations, the research identifies common teamwork behaviors and interprets them through both inductive thematic analysis and a deductive comparison to a four-factor model of team effectiveness: interdependency, potency, trust, and goal setting. A total of 3,874 positive and 1,934 negative comments were analyzed from 1,032 students across 397 teams. Positive behaviors included a strong work ethic, reliable attendance, communication, creativity, leadership, and supportiveness. Negative behaviors focused on poor communication, low contribution, unreliability, controlling attitudes, procrastination, and skill gaps. Many comments displayed mixed values, containing both praise and critique, revealing the complexity of peer perceptions and real-world teamwork dynamics. These findings not only align with established theoretical frameworks but also provide a foundation for identifying dysfunctional teams early and supporting team development. By systematically categorizing student observations, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how engineering students evaluate peers and how their perceptions reflect broader teamwork constructs."

A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving 251 participants. The collected data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Findings indicate that students in KSA demonstrate higher usage rates of LLMs, with ChatGPT identified as the most frequently used tool. Although KSA academics show limited use of LLMs, UK academics did not use them for feedback generation. Thematic analysis revealed three key themes: (a) “It saves effort”, (b) “It is not as smart and genuine as a human”, and (c) “Making it more like humans and less like a machine”. The findings emphasize the need for institutional policies to guide the responsible integration of LLM-generated feedback, ensuring alignment with teaching goals and improving feedback quality."

Understanding these motivations is crucial for enhancing program design, increasing participation, promoting inclusivity, and allocating resources efficiently. Thirty-six students from three Northeastern U.S. universities were interviewed via Zoom. Interview prompts were validated by students for impartiality, and transcripts were analyzed inductively by three independent coders. Results show that students join ICPs to gain technical skills, advance career goals, network with peers and faculty, apply classroom knowledge, strengthen resumes, make an impact, and secure funding. Overall, social and utility values of ICPs predominate. The findings suggest that ICPs should deliberately create professional networking opportunities and provide targeted training, workshops, and mentoring to support the development of technical and professional skills. Although ICPs constitute valuable experiential learning experiences that engage students in innovation ecosystems, many students remain unaware of these opportunities."

The quality of a lecturer's performance is reflected through a structured evaluation process. However, this process still faces significant challenges due to the limited accessibility of lecturer performance data, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the quality of the lecturer workload (LW). To address this issue, a classification system using a machine learning approach is proposed to provide transparent and reliable information. This paper compares the performance of four variants of the Naïve Bayes algorithm: GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, and ComplementNB. The goal is to classify LW status into three categories: Meets Requirements, Partially Meets Requirements, and Does Not Meet Requirements. Based on the results of the Confusion Matrix analysis, BernoulliNB achieved the highest accuracy at 83%, followed by GaussianNB (77%), ComplementNB (57%), and MultinomialNB (53%). Overall, BernoulliNB demonstrated the best performance for LW classification based on SCU indicators. These findings can establish a foundation for developing an automated evaluation system that utilizes machine learning, supporting an objective and efficient assessment of lecturer performance."

This theory suggests that money is involved in eco-designing products, digital traceability, and reverse logistics. The principle underlying this framework is “design-oriented methodology.” Organizations may become more eco-efficient by using less energy and materials if they make adjustments to their value chain that are in accordance with CE. They could also be able to improve their finance-related KPIs by making sure that their efforts are the proper magnitude. This will shorten the time it takes to pay back the loan and give you a favorable net present value. Closed-loop and refurbishment operations can help reduce waste. The results suggest that these companies can make these changes. The management framework divides the supply chain into five parts: supply-side, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal.

A Boost Converter is used to raise the input voltage to 197 V DC, followed by a full-bridge SPWM inverter to generate an alternating voltage waveform. However, the inverter output inherently contains harmonic distortions due to high-frequency switching. To address this issue, an LC filter is introduced at the inverter output to suppress harmonic components and improve the waveform quality. The system is modeled and simulated in Software. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is employed to evaluate harmonic content and Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) before and after the filter. Simulation results show that the fundamental frequency at 50 Hz is dominant, and the use of the LC filter effectively reduces the amplitude of higher-order harmonics while enhancing the sinusoidal shape of the voltage output. The filtered output achieves a significantly lower THD, indicating improved power quality suitable for residential or grid-connected applications."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification plays a pivotal role in remote sensing applications. Yet, it remains a very difficult task because of the high spectral dimensionality, spatial variability, and scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, recent studies have explored architectures that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for capturing local spatial features with Transformers for modeling long-range spectral dependencies. However, existing approaches often suffer from suboptimal feature fusion strategies that inadequately integrate the complementary information from both branches. In this study, we propose AFM-Transformer, a novel spectral-spatial dual-branch framework enhanced by an adaptive fusion module (AFM). The AFM is a lightweight, attention-based gating mechanism that dynamically learns to assign sample-specific importance to features extracted by the CNN and Transformer branches. This enables adaptive and context-aware fusion of spatial and spectral representations, enhancing the model’s discriminative capability. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed AFM-Transformer through comprehensive experiments on three benchmark hyper-spectral datasets. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy."

The presented concept offers a promising methodology for equipping students with the skills required to work in the battery industry. In particular, the virtual battery laboratory is significantly less expensive to implement than constructing a physical laboratory. Consequently, this advantage can facilitate the dissemination of the concept presented to a wider audience (e.g., other universities). Furthermore, the concept can also be helpful for other disciplines (e.g., mechanical or safety engineering) that address battery technologies either in their curricula or in future professional practice. Therefore, evaluating the transferability of the concept is also covered in this paper."

    "abstract": "The development of an AI-powered health monitoring and prediction platform is presented, addressing the unique physiological and logistical challenges associated with space missions. Acknowledging the limitations of conventional medical systems in remote and resource-constrained environments, the proposed system autonomously tracks, analyzes, and forecasts the health status of space crew members through machine learning models trained on synthetic datasets. The web-based architecture comprises two primary components: an onboard interface that enables crew members to input health-related data and access AI-generated insights, and a remote access portal that allows Earth-based medical personnel to monitor the same data, assess AI-driven recommendations, and provide clinical guidance or intervention as required. By integrating real-time artificial intelligence analysis with expert validation from terrestrial healthcare professionals, the platform offers a robust and reliable solution for health management in space. This hybrid framework enhances safety, responsiveness, and decision-making, demonstrating the effective synergy between autonomous systems and human oversight in mission-critical applications. Although primarily designed for aerospace use, the system also establishes a foundational model for remote healthcare delivery on Earth, highlighting the transformative potential of intelligent systems in managing health in complex and inaccessible environments."

    "abstract": "We analyze the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gaussian LSTM networks (G-LSTMs) for object localization and tracking based on bistatic sonar measurements in scenarios involving moving receivers, missing detections, and potentially biased Gaussian measurements. We formally derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the situation including incorporating past information for noisy nonlinear models. Performance is analyzed on decaying coordinated turn tracks and found to be close to the CRLB and the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), despite having no explicit prior knowledge of the movement or measurement models. The Gaussian and non-Gaussian LSTMs exhibit robustness against missing detections and measurement bias and are able to quantify such biases (if present). This Gaussian architecture shows promise, as performance is slightly worse with their nonGaussian counterparts but offers a covariance estimate and only exhibits a slight underconfidence in predictions. The Gaussian neural networks considered here show the ability to capture environmental uncertainty as given by the dynamic probability of detection. Inference times are small enough to allow for real-time tracking."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor nodes used in remote monitoring applications typically transmit data in a timely manner, often optimising for the Age of Information (AoI). However, this approach focuses solely on keeping updates at the sink fresh without considering the actual value of each update. This method is inefficient for sensor networks, which have limited resources. Transmitting data indiscriminately without evaluating its significance not only increases energy consumption but also raises storage requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheduling strategy that prioritises sensor transmissions based on the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) using an edge mining technique. This ensures that the most valuable updates are received while reducing energy consumption. We frame the scheduling problem as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) and introduce a Whittle Index-based Q-learning (WIQL) policy to dynamically select the most informative sensors. Additionally, we employ an edge mining technique, where raw sensor data is processed locally before transmission, enhancing state estimation at the sink. Experimental results demonstrate that WIQL achieves near-optimal performance while significantly reducing the number of transmitted packets by up to $70 \\%$. This reinforcement learning-based approach provides a scalable and adaptive solution for efficient data scheduling in resource-constrained WSNs."

This paper presents the computational security verification of an IoMT authentication protocol incorporating NTRU lattice-based post-quantum cryptography using CryptoVerif, a formal verification tool that provides concrete probability bounds under standard cryptographic assumptions. Through systematic analysis of a multi-entity healthcare protocol, this study identifies two critical security flaws overlooked by previous symbolic verification methods: device registration authentication failure enabling man-in-the-middle device substitution attacks, and forward secrecy violation through static key encryption that exposes historical medical data upon key compromise. To address these vulnerabilities, we provide an enhanced protocol incorporating Strong Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attacks (SUF-CMA) MAC-based device authentication that cryptographically binds device identity to patient identity, and HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF)-derived ephemeral session keys that achieve forward secrecy through fresh key derivation for each communication session. Our CryptoVerif implementation successfully proves nine security properties including mutual authentication, data confidentiality, device binding, and forward secrecy, with aggregate security bound for 128-bit quantum-resistant security. Unlike symbolic verification tools that assume perfect cryptography, our computational analysis provides concrete security guarantees essential for safety-critical healthcare systems."

However, conventional DEs typically exhibit low dielectric constants, necessitating the application of excessively high electric field strengths (>100 kV/mm) to achieve substantial actuation. In this work, we design a series of poly(butyl acrylate-co-acrylonitrile) (PBA-AN) copolymers by introducing polar cyano groups (-CN) from acrylonitrile (AN, key polar monomer) into a butyl acrylate (BA)-based matrix, and systematically optimize the molar ratio of BA to AN. The optimal copolymer composition (PBA<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">70</sub>-AN<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">30</sub>, 70 mol% BA and 30 mol% AN) endows the DE with a balanced combination of high dielectric performance and superior actuation characteristics: a high dielectric constant of 10.89 at 1 kHz, a low dielectric loss tangent of 0.0197, and a reduced Young's modulus of approximately 0.106 MPa. At a low electric field strength of 30 kV/mm, these DEs achieve an area strain of 20%, a 4.4-fold enhancement compared to the commercial material VHB4910 that only delivers an area strain of 4.5% under identical conditions.

    "abstract": "Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work."

If left unmitigated, these attacks undermine user trust and can incur severe operational, financial, and privacy damages. In fact, adversarial attacks are now recognized as a primary AI security concern alongside data poisoning and model theft. This review maps the current landscape of adversarial threats against modern AI models and compares prevailing defense paradigms, distilling their empirical robustness, resource overhead and deployment readiness across vision, language and multimodal systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reconfigurable wedge-shaped patch antenna array designed for the terahertz (THz) frequency band (100– 120 GHz), integrating Nano-magnetic particles and metamaterials to address challenges in conventional mmWave antenna designs. The proposed 1×4 wedged-shaped array achieves dual functionality: dynamic frequency reconfigurability and reduced mutual coupling between elements. Reconfigurability is enabled by nano-magnetic particles embedded within a dedicated lower substrate layer, which can be activated using a tiny external magnet—eliminating the need for complex biasing circuitry found in diode-based systems. Two particle configurations are explored—vertical and horizontal—with the horizontal configuration demonstrating superior frequency tuning capability across the THz band. To mitigate mutual coupling exacerbated by the presence of multiple tuning particles, specially engineered metamaterial structures are incorporated. These metamaterials effectively suppress inter-element coupling, ensuring stable performance at high frequencies. The proposed design is validated through equivalent circuit analysis using Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS), while full-wave simulations (for bending angles 30° and 45°) are performed using CST Microwave Studio confirm enhanced gain, wider bandwidth, and improved isolation between array elements. The compact, reconfigurable design demonstrates excellent potential for next-generation high-frequency wireless communication systems, including integrated circuits and IoT platforms. The combination of nano-magnetic reconfigurability and metamaterial decoupling establishes a novel framework for flexible and efficient THz antenna array solutions."

Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) are particularly valuable for identifying unauthorized activities on networked hosts. In this context, developing an AI-driven decision-making model requires high-quality datasets that accurately represent both normal and malicious post-intrusion behaviors. This article focuses on the methodology for collecting and unifying datasets that will be used to train an AI model designed to detect host intrusions in a specific environment: the open-source network operating system SoNiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud). SoNiC as a Linux-based open-source NOS, is widely adopted in modern networking infrastructures due to its modular architecture and extensibility. Its unique architecture allows for precise logging and monitoring of system activities, which is crucial for intrusion detection research. To build an effective AI model, it is necessary to collect data reflecting typical post-intrusion behaviors within the SoNiC environment. This includes the simulation of attack scenarios, collection of relevant system call data, and aggregation of logs and system events that signify security threats."

Conceptual foundations for the functioning of the STS have been outlined, with emphasis on its role in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The study has substantiated the need to balance fiscal interests with entrepreneurial incentives by determining the optimal level of tax burden. A regression model has been developed and tested to assess the relationship between tax burden, shadow economy level, and fiscal efficiency. The impact of tax administration reform within the framework of the National Revenue Strategy until 2030 has been analyzed. It has been demonstrated that digital transformation significantly contributes to improving fiscal outcomes by reducing administrative costs and enhancing tax compliance. Based on the results, practical recommendations have been proposed to increase the fiscal efficiency of the STS without undermining the competitiveness of the SME sector."

However, they have not been extensively applied to machining tool condition monitoring. The present study addresses this gap. This study investigates tool condition monitoring method using an eddy current probe. Eddy current probe is used to scan face milled surfaces and the tool condition is inferred from the probe response. 2 probes with different shapes were used, a round-shaped coil and a racetrack-shaped coil. The probes are used to scan surfaces milled using face milling inserts with different wear states. The insert wear is determined from the eddy current probe responses that were processed by filtering and Discrete Fourier Transform. Peak height of the resulting frequency spectra was used to determine the tool condition. The results indicate that the method is suitable for tool condition monitoring. In general, the response peak height increased as the inserts were more worn. The results also show that eddy current probe shape has significant influence to the wear measurement. The racetrack coil was significantly more sensitive for wear measurement compared to the round coil. Future studies could investigate the use of different coil configurations, such as reflection probes or probe arrays."

The goal of self-nomination is to reduce the number of users (UEs) feeding back channel state information (CSI) to the base station (BS), by letting each UE decide whether to feed back based on its estimated likelihood of being scheduled and its potential contribution to precoding in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink. Unlike SNR- or SINR-based thresholding methods, the proposed approach uses rich spatial channel statistics and learns nontrivial correlation effects that affect eventual MU-MIMO scheduling decisions. To train the self-nomination network under an average feedback constraint, we propose two different strategies: one based on direct optimization with gradient approximations, and another using policy gradient-based optimization with a stochastic Bernoulli policy to handle non-differentiable scheduling. The framework also supports proportional-fair scheduling by incorporating dynamic user weights. Numerical results confirm that the proposed self-nomination method significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead. Compared to baseline feedback methods, self-nomination can reduce feedback by as much as 65%, saving not only bandwidth but also allowing many UEs to avoid feedback altogether (and thus, potentially enter a sleep mode). Self-nomination achieves this significant savings with negligible reduction in sum-rate or fairness."

    "abstract": "Cloud gaming is a rapidly growing domain that requires low-latency and high-responsiveness architectures to deliver an engaging user experience. This paper presents an innovative Digital Twin (DT)-based framework designed to mitigate the effects of variable network conditions on video streaming and input responsiveness. The proposed architecture integrates Console and User Equipment DTs, which synchronize video streams and user inputs using lightweight RTSP and MQTTbased communication, ensuring real-time interaction even in challenging network scenarios. To validate the framework, we developed a custom cloud gaming application simulating a shark-and-fish pursuit game. This use case allows for precise evaluation of system performance under varying latency and delay conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the architecture’s ability to maintain game responsiveness, revealing critical delay thresholds and highlighting the impact of delay variability on user performance. These findings illustrate the potential of DTbased architectures to enhance the robustness and fairness of cloud gaming systems."

    "abstract": "This research WIP paper investigates the alignment between skills developed in engineering education doctoral pro-grams and those sought in industry. As engineering education evolves as a research-based discipline, its Ph.D. graduates in-creasingly pursue diverse careers beyond academia. However, the alignment between doctoral-level competencies and globally in -demand workforce skills remains poorly understood. This study presents a qualitative mapping of core Ph.D. competencies to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 26 “Top Skills for 2025,” aiming to identify strong alignments and gaps. The research questions guiding this study are: 1)What competencies are emphasized in leading U.S. engi-neering education doctoral programs? 2)To what extent do these competencies align with the globally in-demand skills identified by the World Economic Forum? Using reflective dialogue and consensus-building, the research team identified seven core competencies in engineering education Ph.D. programs: educational research, curriculum design, assess-ment, communication, project leadership, equity and inclusion, and professional development. These were mapped to the WEF skills using a three-point relevance scale. The resulting matrix and heatmap reveal strong alignment in areas like analyti-cal thinking, problem-solving, and active learning. However, notable gaps exist in technical and digital areas, including AI literacy, programming, and technology use. These findings suggest opportunities for programs to better integrate digital fluency and interdisciplinary leadership. This work contributes to discussions on doctoral career readiness by offering a framework to connect academic competencies with workforce demands, supporting more inclusive and adaptable engineering education Ph.D. pathways."

    "abstract": "This WIP research category paper explores the relationship between working engineers' identity and their engagement in engineering design activities within workplace settings. Specifically, we examine how professional identity influences practicing civil engineers' engagement in design activities in workplace settings. Using an early stage grounded theory approach, we conducted and analyzed semi-structured interviews with three practicing civil engineers. Interview transcripts were analyzed individually through initial coding and content analysis to identify themes regarding the relationship between professional identity and design engagement. While our analysis is ongoing, we illustrate three cases to demonstrate the powerful relationships between identity and design engagement in the workplace. Preliminary analysis suggest that engineers' engagement in design activities is closely tied to their professional identity development. Similar to patterns in academic settings, these engineers showed engagement behaviors reflecting their engineering identity. However, professional contexts add complexity to how identity shapes design practice. This analysis provides insights for improving undergraduate education by better aligning educational experiences with workplace practices."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth in data volume has driven significant advances in machine learning, but the inclusion of private or unauthorized data in training dataset has led to a surge in deletion requests and privacy disputes. While retraining models without the contested data offers a fundamental solution, it incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge has given rise to machine unlearning, a process that selectively removes knowledge of specified data from a trained model. However, most unlearning methods require access to the complete original training dataset and often suffer from degraded generalization performance after unlearning. This limitation makes them impractical in scenarios where the full training dataset is no longer accessible. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unlearning technique for image classification and generation tasks that maintains effectiveness even with a small part of the original dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, supporting the right to be forgotten."

This mixed-methods study explored the learning outcomes of minority undergraduate engineering students after their one-year participation in the ROLE program. The Goal Congruity theory framed the study and informed the importance of students' learning and identity development. Through pre- and post-experience surveys, students assessed their understanding of social and professional skills, research in engineering understanding, and general research abilities. In addition, individual interviews were conducted to explore the reinforcement, development, and changes in student identity. Preliminary results indicated an improvement in students' understanding of engineering and research skills. Students also highlighted aspects such as the programs' interdisciplinarity and research presentations as key to developing their professional identity. To better support minority engineering students' college pathways, the adoption of effective UREs could effectively leverage students' learning and experiences contributing to their persistence in engineering."

    "abstract": "This innovative practice full paper describes a strategic approach to integrating “whole engineer” competencies across the Wake Forest Engineering curriculum. Engineering education reform has been called for in numerous national reports from organizations including the National Academy of Engineering, ASEE, industry, and various professional societies. These reports envision a modern engineer with expanded competencies beyond only technical expertise. Wake Forest Engineering was established with a mission to “Educate the Whole Engineer,” integrating many diverse competencies (e.g. character development, leadership, entrepreneurial mindset, and social consciousness) into a rigorous technical curriculum. This paper presents our strategic approach to curriculum development, demonstrating how we aligned expanded competencies with ABET Student Outcomes 1-7 while embedding professional formation and character formation throughout the engineering experience. From the lens of program leadership, we showcase strategies and specific competency mappings across the core curriculum and describe pedagogical approaches that cultivate technical expertise alongside virtues like integrity, compassion, humility, and leadership. This transformation journey was guided by Kotter's Change Model. This intentional approach to educating the “Whole Engineer” has yielded significant results: high job placement for graduates, strong enrollment and retention of students, ABET accreditation, high program rankings in US News Report, unprecedented student diversity (42 % women, 25% racial and ethnic diversity), recognition for curricular innovation, and evidence of cultivating character. Key success factors included experiential learning integration, diverse stakeholder involvement, strategic internal and external partnerships, team teaching, collaborative sharing of instructional materials, and comprehensive competency mapping throughout the curriculum. While it is important to show measurable assessment results of the learning, this paper focuses on the identification and implementation of the Whole Engineer competencies and not about assessment of these competencies which is a future paper."

    "abstract": "In large-scale computing courses, students often struggle to stay engaged with lengthy lecture recordings, especially when learning complex and abstract concepts. Despite the wide availability of recorded class sessions and asynchronous materials, recent studies suggest that learners frequently disengage from videos exceeding 30 minutes. This paper investigates using short, example-based videos-each under five minutes-as a practical alternative to traditional long-format lecture recordings. Grounded in cognitive learning theory and prior work on microlearning, we designed short videos centered on concrete programming examples to target specific subtopics. These videos were introduced in Spring 2025 in a course with 330 students, following a baseline semester in Fall 2024 with 382 students, where only traditional lectures were used. To implement this approach in practice, we embedded the short videos into the course LMS and aligned them with weekly topics and assessments. Analysis of survey results, attendance records, LMS usage, and direct comparisons of long vs. short video engagement revealed several positive outcomes: higher average view counts, increased playback per student, and stronger student preference for short videos in time-limited situations. Students also reported that the example-driven format helped with exam preparation and retention. These findings suggest that brief, focused videos can be an effective research-to-practice intervention for increasing engagement and supporting learning in large computing courses."

Early feedback indicates increased student satisfaction from immediate feedback and reduced grading time for instructors. This practice highlights how educators can leverage automation to enhance learning, with future work to improve usability and LMS integration."

    "abstract": "With the growing number of users in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, demodulation reference signals (DMRS) are efficiently multiplexed in the code domain via orthogonal cover codes (OCC) to ensure orthogonality and minimize pilot interference. In this paper, we investigate uplink DMRS-based channel estimation for MU-MIMO systems with Type II OCC pattern standardized in third generation partnership project (3GPP) Release 18, leveraging location-specific statistical channel state information (SCSI) to enhance performance. Specifically, we propose a SCSI-assisted Bayesian channel estimator (SA-BCE) based on the minimum mean square error criterion to suppress the pilot interference and noise, albeit at the cost of cubic computational complexity due to matrix inversions. To reduce this complexity while maintaining performance, we extend the scheme to a windowed version (SA-WBCE), which incorporates antenna-frequency domain windowing and beam-delay domain processing to exploit asymptotic sparsity and mitigate energy leakage in practical systems. To avoid the frequent real-time SCSI acquisition, we construct a grid-based location-specific SCSI database based on the principle of spatial consistency, and subsequently leverage the uplink received signals within each grid to extract the SCSI. Facilitated by the multilinear structure of wireless channels, we formulate the SCSI acquisition problem within each grid as a tensor decomposition problem, where the factor matrices are parameterized by the multi-path powers, delays, and angles. The computational complexity of SCSI acquisition can be significantly reduced by exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed location-specific SCSI database construction method achieves high accuracy, while the SA-BCE and SA-WBCE significantly outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks in MU-MIMO systems."

While digital back-propagation (DBP) techniques have been used to mitigate SOA nonlinearities in coherent systems, they require accurate SOA parameters, which are often difficult to measure. In this work, we examine a SOA booster configuration with a neural network (NN) equalizer that is not based on a physical model and thus does not require knowledge of device parameters. The NN compensates collectively contributions from all sources of nonlinearity, e.g., nonlinear phase noise (NLPN) and chirp. We examine the trade-offs the NN equalization allows between gain, nonlinearity, and launch power by sweeping the SOA injection current and input power. The NN equalization achieves Q-factor improvements of up to 4 dB over linear equalization for 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals at both 30 Gbaud and 60 Gbaud. We demonstrate its effectiveness in compensating SOA distortions over 60 km and 100 km fiber transmission links. The NN equalizer also shows strong robustness to varying training scenarios and signal conditions, and to higher-order modulation formats such as 64-QAM. Performance- complexity analysis of the NN equalizer shows several trade-offs."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal reasoning by incorporating the notion of “slow thinking” into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that models can learn to adaptively use different levels of reasoning to tackle questions of varying complexity. We propose a novel paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which consists of minimal semantic atomic steps. Unlike existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method not only generates flexible CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomenon of overthinking for easier tasks. To introduce structured reasoning into visual cognition, we design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules: (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single-step utilization rate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 × and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3%.

    "abstract": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data presents a challenging problem for detecting subsurface targets due to surface reflections and the complex clutter caused by heterogeneous soil structures. While traditional methods treat clutter removal and target detection as separate processes, this study presents an integrated deep learning approach that simultaneously optimizes both tasks. In the first phase of the study, the first proposed model, Dec-YOLO (Model I), demonstrated that “joint training” of clutter removal networks (UNet, CR-Net, DC-ViT) from the literature with a detection network improves detection performance compared to sequential methods. Building on this finding, the second phase proposes the original RAFDeC-YOLO (Model II) architecture. This architecture features a specialized denoising block (decoder) that branches off from the standard YOLOv12 backbone. The fundamental innovation of this branch is that it feeds back the cleaned and enriched feature maps it produces back to the relevant neck layers of the YOLO architecture via the proposed Residual Adapter Fusion mechanism. This strategic feature transfer maximizes discriminative power, particularly in challenging scenarios such as weak dielectric targets and asphalt-covered surfaces, by enabling the detection network to access both noisy raw data and cleaned spatial details. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 25.8% higher localization accuracy on hybrid datasets and an 87.5% improvement in challenging real-world scenarios, while reducing computational complexity by approximately 43% for efficient deployment."

The estimation process leverages a precise equivalent circuit of the DACV testing system, along with an accurately determined attenuation factor and angular frequency of the measured test voltage, to improve the reliability of loss tangent calculations. The extended approach introduces a new expression for loss tangent, derived from peak-to-peak testing voltages, and incorporates a moving average filter to mitigate the effects of DC offset, amplitude and time quantization errors, and noise. A comparative analysis of simulation and experimental results demonstrates that the conventional method lacks precision in estimating the loss tangent, especially when measuring values as low as 0.1%—a typical range for both new and aged underground power cables. However, the proposed extended method provides reliable loss tangent estimation within this range, ensuring acceptable accuracy and improved measurement consistency."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in system logs has attracted considerable interest with the development of deep learning and big data. Many methods and approaches have achieved good results in log anomaly detection, but exploiting the rich dependencies hidden in log data remains an extremely challenging task. Recently, Transformer-based models, such as LogBERT, represent a strong and promising foundation thanks to their ability to capture rich contextual information within log sequences. The limitation of these models is that they mainly treat logs as a sequence of discrete tokens, neglecting the crucial and continuous information embedded in the temporal and numerical dynamics between events. This limitation can lead to a high false positive rate, thus reducing the practical utility of the model. In this work, we propose DualBERT, a hybrid framework designed to address this gap. Our approach leverages a dual-model architecture: 1) a primary Transformer (LogBERT) to analyze the log’s symbolic key sequence; 2) a parallel and specialized parameter model represented by an LSTM-based regressor that analyzes inter-event features such as temporal deltas and cyclic patterns. The anomaly scores of both models are then fused using an XGBoost classifier to produce a final robust decision. We conduct a rigorous and fully supervised evaluation on the HDFS benchmark dataset. Our results demonstrate that DualBERT achieves an F1 score of 98.75%, significantly surpassing the satisfactorily evaluated LogBERT benchmark (98.29%). This improvement is mainly due to a substantial increase in accuracy (from 96.64% to 97.70%) and a 43% reduction in the false positive rate. Our results confirm that merging symbolic sequence analysis with dedicated inter-event dynamic modeling is an effective strategy to create a more reliable and practical system for real-world logarithmic anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "This research category full paper explores how to strengthen expansive approaches toward justice-centered computer science education (CSEd). The study examines how incorporating “bugs” and allowing for student resistance in an unplugged computational thinking (CT) activity can reveal important insights about learners' CT skills and perceptions in real time. The findings suggest that prioritizing opportunities for social and embodied learning, resisting the dominant focus on coding and programming, and expanding research methodologies to include multi-modal analysis can provide a more holistic understanding of students' CT and disciplinary identities. This approach contrasts with dominant CSEd research that is often in isolation from students' lived experiences. Implications include the need to consider teacher moves when designing research studies and the importance of examining the complexity of teaching and learning computational thinking with justice-oriented practices."

    "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) create rich discussion forum data that can be used to provide valuable insights into the affective and behavioral status of learners. Although previous studies have focused on either sentiment or engagement separately, few have combined these two dimensions into a single analytical framework. This paper presents a hierarchical BERT-based model for detecting emotions in MOOC forums, pretrained on GoEmotions and adapted to the Stanford MOOCPosts dataset. The approach classifies sentiment polarity and then performs fine-grained multi-label emotion detection, augmented with contextual embeddings capturing thread structure, temporal dynamics, and user identity. Results demonstrate that transfer learning improves emotion classification performance over baselines, particularly for low-frequency emotions such as confusion and curiosity (Macro-F1 =0.72 vs. 0.52 for logistic regression). Correlation analysis reveals that positive and epistemic emotions (such as curiosity, gratitude, and joy) are strongly associated with deeper thread engagement. In contrast, negative emotions (including frustration and confusion) are associated with lower response rates and participation. Finally, an anomaly detection module combining affective and engagement signals achieves high precision (0.81 at Medium sensitivity) while reducing instructor workload by 73%. Together, these findings highlight the potential of emotion-aware engagement analytics to support scalable, real-time interventions in MOOCs."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "To overcome this problem of floor plan recognition, a new hybrid architecture Centrality-Based GraphSAGE (CB-SAGE) is presented which models the problem as a graph classification problem. The actual building architectures are translated into a graph structure with each room/compartment becoming a node and the interconnectivity among rooms becoming the graph edges. However, the regular GraphSAGE methods mostly depend on the local neighbourhood sampling and aggregation, risking to neglect more structural properties. CB-SAGE improve upon this by embedding centrality-based measures like clustering coefficient or betweenness centrality directly into the feature matrix of nodes during training. Such metrics provide the graph embeddings with topological context that allows the model to learn more discriminative and informative pattern. Due to that, the model can capture more unique spatial plans and categorizing sophisticated types of floor plans. Evaluation on real-world datasets indicate that CB-SAGE considerably gains the standard models in regard to accuracy and generalization capacity. The approach is of practical value to the fields of architectural analysis, robotics navigation, and the design of smart buildings, where the effective and meaningful graph-based spatial environment representation is important. CB-SAGE unites the benefits of local aggregation with the global structural information, thus providing a potent new paradigm of graph based spatial learning. The proposed system had improved results over alternative approaches and recorded high Macro-F1 score of 77.5 % and purity of 75.4 % on the House-GAN floor plan dataset. It was always outperforming GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE."

    "abstract": "The University Course Timetabling with Student Sectioning Problem, as the subject of the most recent international timetabling competition on educational timetabling, remains a novel challenge. Many successful metaheuristics on previous benchmarks are yet to be tested on this problem. Due to its significantly higher complexity compared to conventional university course timetabling, achieving feasibility is extremely difficult, with current state-of-the-art matheuristic approaches from the literature requiring more than 10 days to achieve feasibility on certain instances. The official validator’s cost metric only evaluates valid solutions and thus provides insufficient guidance for search methods towards feasibility. To address this, we propose a Distance to Feasibility metric as a guiding strategy for metaheuristics and analyze its effectiveness through an empirical study. We apply baseline metaheuristics to the 30 problem instances of the International Timetabling Competition 2019 dataset and assess their performance. Hill Climbing outperforms Random Search by achieving feasible solutions, while RS fails to reach feasibility. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric effectively guides the search toward feasibility. Furthermore, we show that exploitative metaheuristics are superior in reducing the distance to feasibility, at the higher risk of being trapped in local optima compared to more exploratory methods. Overall, the proposed metric is of significant importance for finding feasible solutions to complex university course timetabling problems."

Wearable robots, such as exoskeletons, are emerging devices for reducing musculoskeletal disorders in the construction industry because of their ability to improve reduce muscle fatigue and strain. The promises of wearable robots, as well as the demands and need for improved health and safety in the construction industry, have prompted construction companies to begin investing in the use of wearable robots. This has necessitated the development of a future workforce equipped with the necessary knowledge to advance human-wearable robot interactions in the construction industry. However, a comprehensive review of existing studies on wearable robots reveals that scholars have primarily focused on assessing their effectiveness and usability. This research aims to identify the knowledge areas critical for advancing human-wearable robot interactions using Delphi study technique. Out of the 25 knowledge areas retrieved from the literature, 10 were agreed upon, with an additional 9 knowledge domains being suggested by the experts. The critical knowledge areas are centered around human factors and ergonomics, safety, technical and social matters. This study sets the pace for advancing human-wearable robot interactions in the construction industry by understanding academic perceptions on the knowledge areas required for advancing wearable robot implementation in the construction industry. Practically, construction engineering and management institutions and professional bodies in the construction industry can utilize these findings to develop tailored curricula for advancing wearable robots in the industry."

    "abstract": "High-performance GaN-based ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for applications in harsh-environment sensing, space-based UV monitoring, and high-speed optical communications. However, conventional GaN-based p-i-n homojunction UV photodetectors face limitations in responsivity due to significant UV absorption in the p-GaN layer. To address this issue, we propose a novel full depletion (FD) thin-layer structure incorporating a strategically placed 1-nm n-type interlayer at the p–i interface with optimized doping to enhance carrier separation and collection. Results reveal a 27.3% increase in peak responsivity, reaching 0.163 A/W at 360 nm, compared to 0.128 A/W in conventional devices. In addition, the new-structured photodetector exhibits a specific detectivity (D*) of 2.88×1013 Jones, and a low response time of approximately 37 ns. The results of experiments and simulations are highly consistent, verifying the accuracy of the proposed model. Notably, the proposed design maintains excellent electrical performance, with dark current levels comparable to those of traditional architectures, thereby ensuring device stability. The FD-thin doped layer strategy offers a straightforward yet effective route to significantly improve the responsivity of GaN-based UV photodetectors without introducing fabrication complexity or the need for heterojunction integration. This architecture presents a promising pathway toward high-efficiency UV photodetection systems for next-generation applications."

The misconceptions about the necessity of obtaining a degree, certifications, and experiences to find employment, as well as the lack of qualified cybersecurity instructors and community role models, pose challenges for cybersecurity education. Minority students continue to face obstacles in pursuing careers in cybersecurity, and we examine the complexities of this educational challenge. This ethnographic case study explores the cybersecurity pathway curriculum in secondary education. We survey students in GenCyber summer camps, students in dual enrollment summer programs, and high school cybersecurity and computer science classes to learn the perceptions of high school students towards cybersecurity education.

This study proposes a non-intrusive method to infer a user’s emotional state based solely on their music listening history. Unlike existing approaches that rely on biometric data or textual sentiment analysis, this method ensures privacy while leveraging analytical features of songs, such as tempo, valence, and energy, to classify emotions. The proposed framework maps songs into an emotional space and tracks long-term mood trends by clustering user listening patterns. The experimental phase involved 30 volunteers whose listening histories were analyzed to reconstruct emotional profiles. The results indicate that our proposal might be used to identify stable moods, seasonal trends, and fluctuations. These insights have broad applications, from improving music recommendation systems to informing mental health interventions and improving user experiences in adaptive environments. In summary, this study highlights music as a valuable tool for emotion recognition, paving the way for innovative, privacypreserving applications in personalized digital services."

    "abstract": "Glaciers in the high-mountain regions of the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalayas are critical for sustaining downstream water resources, yet their short-term and localized responses to climate variability remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a machine learning–based framework for high-resolution glacier monitoring using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2016 to 2024. The proposed approach establishes a complete end-to-end pipeline for glacier change analysis, including satellite image preprocessing, supervised SVM-based tri-class classification (snow, partial snow/ice, and no snow), pixel-level change detection, and temporal trend analysis. The tri-class model achieves an overall accuracy of 83%, capturing detailed variations in glacier surface conditions that conventional binary models often overlook. The results indicate a weakening of the Karakoram Anomaly after 2019, with glaciers displaying divergent behaviors and a general trend toward retreat, particularly at lower elevations. While effective, the approach is limited by cloud-prone Sentinel-2 observations, manual and NDSI-based training data, and reduced accuracy in transitional zones such as firn or debris-covered ice. Overall, this framework advances long-term glacier monitoring by improving spatial and temporal resolution, supports water resource management, and provides a foundation for assessing Glacial Lake Outburst Flood risks under changing climatic conditions."

    "abstract": "Medical images are prone to noise and artifacts, which affect their diagnostic performance. Frequency-dependent noise can cause unclear images and complicate disease detection, leading to misdiagnosis. Denoising is a crucial step in preprocessing to improve image clarity and visibility, especially for automated diagnostic processes. The primary focus of this paper is to improve the visual quality of denoised images by preserving fine details and structural similarity (edges), maintaining sharpness, and simultaneously removing blurriness. For this purpose, this study proposed a novel Pyramidal Attention-based Efficient UNet (PAUnet) for RGB skin dermatoscopic image enhancement. The technique uses an efficient UNet as a backbone, incorporating residual blocks to prevent vanishing gradients, and utilizing channel attention in skip connections to enhance feature interdependencies by reducing noise while preserving fine details. Atrous spatial pyramidal pooling (ASPP) in the bottleneck to enhance the capacity of multi-scale feature extractions to speed up the calculations and merge low-level features across multiple resolutions to improve the preservation of structural similarity and edges collectively. This study used a publicly available dataset, i.e., RGB skin dermatoscopic images HAM10000, for extensive experimentation that validates the effectiveness of the proposed PAUnet by improving the values of 0.8601% dB SSIM and 33.4315% dB PSNR, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art techniques."

Current systems with various screening methods for patients affected from PCOS suffer from various obstacles like early identification of symptoms in addition to the process of biological indicator tracking. Advanced technologies are available in the healthcare domain thereby enabling patients to have personalized choice of treatment from doctors. Still, the usage of wearable gadgets for treatment of PCOS is not prevalent. Biomarkers such as glucose fluctuations in addition to changes in human hormones need to be monitored as wearables lack such capability. Conventional methods used for PCOS diagnosis suffer from several pitfalls. Handheld devices with biosensors incorporated help in filling this research gap that is being identified. Artificial intelligence based devices are integrated with handheld devices in addition to sensor methodologies for tracking PCOS biomarkers. The proposed techniques work on the basis of the above. Saliva analysis is done by these gadgets for identification of hormonal abnormalities by usage of silicon luminescence. The data that is acquired is being processed initially in approaches that are based on YOLO. In the presence of anomalies, an alarm is being dispatched. Ava wristband is employed for PCOS indicator tracking to which AI techniques are combined in addition to biosensor devices that are compatible with the mobile. Variations in the hormones are monitored by the system with advanced nanotechnology along with photonic sensing. Identification of anomalies besides involvement of users along with treatments done to patients in preferred time makes YOLOv8 suitable for implementation. The results obtained show that the system performs well with additional amounts of data and provides better treatment. The suggested strategy outperformed current techniques in testing, achieving a 92% success rate, and 94% specificity, respectively, in identifying anomalies linked to PCOS. The technique offers dependable screening by using aptamer-derived and antibody-associated biorecognition mechanisms to focus on biomarkers, including follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, and the hormone luteinizing. In the final analysis, this AI-powered wearable provides constant, current data for preemptive management of PCOS and early identification, increasing the effectiveness and accessibility of tailored therapy, 89% sensitivity."

Manual assessment is labor-intensive, subjective, and dependent on scarce expert knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose PDDC-Net, a deep learning framework for Plant leaf Disease Detection and Classification that couples image preprocessing with a residual network-based convolutional neural network (ResNet-CNN). Preprocessing performs denoising, illumination/color normalization, and size standardization to mitigate acquisition variability. The ResNet backbone extracts discriminative texture- and vein-pattern features, while the classification head assigns the most probable disease class. On top of recognition, PDDC-Net integrates a lightweight decision module that maps each detected disease to agronomic guidance—suggesting appropriate remedial actions (e.g., fertilizer amendments and, when relevant, pesticide recommendations) aligned with best-practice guidelines. Experiments on a curated multi-crop image set demonstrate that PDDC-Net achieves high accuracy for both detection and classification and remains robust under changing lighting, background clutter, and moderate leaf occlusion. The results indicate that PDDC-Net can serve as a practical component of precision-agriculture workflows, enabling rapid field-level diagnosis and actionable treatment suggestions to help stabilize yield and reduce input waste."

Despite their excellent recognition accuracy, traditional deep learning techniques frequently use static, completely labeled datasets and are not flexible enough for dynamic real-world situations. Instead of using passive supervision, this study suggests a unique reinforcement learning-based architecture for HAR that enables an agent to learn activity classification through interactive feedback. Our methodology, which makes use of the WISDM dataset, formulates HAR as a sequential decision-making problem in which a Deep QNetwork (DQN) agent observes temporal sensor information and repeatedly refines its predictions in response to environmental rewards. This paradigm change gives HAR systems the flexibility and self-improvement they need to function in dynamic environments and with little prior knowledge. A potential step toward autonomous and self-tuning activity detection systems is indicated by experimental results showing that our RL agent not only learns efficient activity representations but also generalizes well to unknown data."

A metaverse combines many technologies with a virtual representation of the real world system for enabling applications. Although a metaverse enables many applications, there are challenges associated with its deployment. Therefore, in this paper, we consider sensing in metaverse-empowered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. A massive number of sensors are considered to effectively sense the physical world states and share them with the metaverse. A problem is formulated to minimize the cost of sensing in terms of energy and latency. Our problem is based on optimizing the resource allocation and association for sensing units. We present a solution based on double deep Q-network (DDQN) for joint association and resource allocation in sensing for metaverse over UAVs network because the defined problem is non-convex and combinatorial. In the end, we validate our idea with comprehensive simulation results."

    "abstract": "The full research paper describes an active learning based in-class intervention to encourage the development of code review and debugging skills in students from the CS program. The rapid proliferation of AI-based applications has heightened the importance of code review and debugging skills among software developers. Organizations leverage code review processes not only to ensure software quality and accuracy but also to facilitate knowledge transfer, promote productive collaboration, maintain consistency, and share ideas. However, incorporating code review practices into classroom settings presents challenges due to the associated heavy workload, often resulting in low student motivation and participation. To address these issues, we propose an in-class active learning framework, Code Insight, which integrates seamlessly into class lectures without adding extra workload for students or additional grading for instructors. Recognizing that beginner programmers have limited knowledge and experience with programming concepts, the goal of this study is to provide strategic guidance to help students effectively and systematically review, analyze, and evaluate existing code written by others, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the code. In our study, students participated in the Code Insight activity during class, using a classroom response system to report the correctness of provided code through multiple-choice questions. The impact of Code Insight on learning is evaluated by collecting student feedback at the end of the semester. Our findings indicate that the Code Insight activity presents a sufficient challenge for students, thereby improving their learning experience and highlighting the necessity of integrating more extensive code review practices in entry-level programming courses. Students expressed a preference for these activities over traditional lectures, noting that they helped them debug their programs by identifying and fixing errors, and they feel confident in writing a program and addressing any issues through complex debugging tasks. The proposed intervention provides a platform for students to discuss misconceptions, visualize multiple problem-solving approaches, and thoroughly understand existing code."

    "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) strengthens computational efficiency through the deployment of cloud services near end-users which shortens processing time and optimizes resource management. The scheduling process of tasks determines how MEC environments achieve their optimal performance levels. This research examines three MEC task scheduling approaches which include Adaptive Task Scheduling Algorithm (ATSA), Smart Execution Scheduling Algorithm (SESA), and Multi-Task Scheduling Algorithm (MTSA). The Workflow Simulator performs algorithm evaluation by measuring three factors including task execution time and completion time as well as throughput performance. Task execution efficiency together with resource utilization and total task throughput stand higher with MTSA than with ATSA and SESA. The ATSA scheduling approach focuses on performing tasks with lower priority yet it executes them quickly yet SESA delivers swift execution and achieves higher throughput rates. The parallel approach used by MTSA creates the most efficient system by minimizing delays of tasks and distributing resources properly. The study presents an approach for helping users choose suitable scheduling algorithms that align with their operational needs. The research shows that efficient scheduling of tasks in MEC systems provides improved performance together with better reliability. Various scheduling techniques demonstrate their effectiveness by managing different MEC workloads which results in better computational efficiency for these systems. The proposed MTSA approach has an overall accuracy of 97%, exceeding that of the SESA and ATSA methods."

    "abstract": "Fault location is vital information for the speedy restoration of faulted overhead transmission lines. Transmission line crew in National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) rely on the line protections’ internal fault locators. Most, if not all, of the line protections installed in NGCP use single-end impedance-based algorithms, which are susceptible to various sources of error, including fault resistance, soil resistivity, and mutual coupling effects from adjacent lines. On the other hand, double-end impedance-based methods are largely immune to these limitations. Since all the grid transmission lines in NGCP are installed with Network Disturbance and Monitoring Equipment (NDME), this study proposes using a double-end impedance-based technique that utilizes the fault recordings captured by the NDMEs. Fault data can be retrieved from the NDMEs through a central computer connected to a dedicated communication network. The double-end approach has been demonstrated to be both reliable and precise in determining fault locations for a range of scenarios. It performs well for typical fault types such as low-resistance line-to-ground, line-to-line, double line-to-ground, and three-phase faults as well as for less typical cases, including highly resistive ground faults."

    "abstract": "Prior work indicates that simply instructing participants to include figures in their concept generation sketches increases user-centered considerations and prompts greater attention to the diverse needs of different potential customers, leading to more effective products. Unfortunately, the one drawback was that fewer concepts were generated. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of learning different quick and easy human figure sketching styles (stick, jointed, box) on student design outcomes, engineering design self-efficacy, and belonging in engineering. An initial quasi-experimental, between-subject classroom study was conducted with undergraduate engineers, where participants took a pre- and post-survey, then underwent a 30-minute sketching instruction and 30-minute concept generation session. The results show that students in the stick and box figure groups tend towards generating a greater number of design concepts compared to the control group, and the jointed figure group generated about the same number of concepts as the control. Findings from the pre-post design self-efficacy survey found nearly statistically significant increases for Identifying Customer Needs for all figure conditions, but not the control. All figure conditions also have a statistically significant increase for Conduct System Level Design. There were no significant differences for sense of belonging. Future work will analyze the consideration of diverse customer needs and will further investigate the impacts of human figure sketching with a larger sample size and the sketching instruction integrated into multiple assignments. This work aims to contribute to understanding effective instructional strategies and improving engineers' visual communication skills."

    "abstract": "Frequent forest fires pose a severe threat to ecological security, while 3D reconstruction technology demonstrates significant potential in assisting fire field monitoring and prevention. Current mainstream methods exhibit notable limitations: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based implicit modeling achieves high precision but suffers from prolonged training duration and impractical real-time rendering. Explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) methods maintain real-time advantages yet face challenges in data storage redundancy and inadequate dynamic modeling capabilities, particularly in handling non-rigid deformations, repetitive textures, and complex illumination variations characteristic of flame and smoke. This study achieves a balance between precision and efficiency through multi-level collaborative optimization. The proposed framework automatically optimizes spatial distribution based on scene characteristics to reduce storage consumption while preserving detail integrity. A frequencyaware constraint module is introduced to suppress reconstruction artifacts via multi-scale covariance matrix optimization. Furthermore, a hybrid image enhancement strategy effectively improves feature discernibility in low-quality fire imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances reconstruction quality for dynamic fire scenarios while maintaining real-time performance, providing a practical technical solution for emergency fire response."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This research paper focuses on LGBTQIA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, and additional groups) students' sense of belonging and engineering identity. Belonging refers to one's sense of fit in various settings, such as engineering. In contrast, engineering identity refers to one's belief that they are the “kind of person” who can do engineering and engineering tasks. Both constructs are interrelated, central predictors of student success in engineering. As engineering programs strive to become more inclusive and welcoming to all students, research regarding marginalized students, such as those from the LGBTQIA+ community, and their connections to their engineering programs and identity has grown. However, research on the LGBTQIA+ community remains nascent, especially quantitative work. In part, challenges to this work stem from small sample sizes, which make it difficult to obtain statistical power, necessitating unique approaches to conducting such research. This study focuses on the LGBTQIA+ population, pooling data from several separate studies that included the same engineering identity and sense of belonging items. In doing so, we generate a large sample size to conduct a thorough quantitative analysis of the LGBTQIA+ population. Of the total 6,265 responses we received, 442, or 7 %, of the participants identified as LGBTQIA+. We used structural equation modeling to test direct, indirect, and latent relationships amongst engineering identity and belonging variables. We then compared LGBTQIA+ and non-LGBTQIA+ groups, as well as specific subgroups. We found that participants who identified as bisexual reported a small negative effect on their engineering identity. However, bisexual, asexual, and the larger population of Queer participants all had a lower sense of belonging compared to their peers. Notably, during the analysis, we identified several instances where LGBTQIA+ students were excluded from quantitative research. An overreliance on the text option to identify them, frequently combining LGBTQIA+ groups for analysis, and not having inclusive demographic options were points of erasure noted. Recommendations for remediation of these issues are provided to expand research."

    "abstract": "This full research paper builds upon the crucial role Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) play in facilitating efficient coding practices for programmers. IDEs support programming in various languages and offer distinct features tailored to different user skill levels. For beginners, choosing a suitable IDE that they can easily get accustomed to is crucial for fostering a positive programming language learning experience in early software development courses, which we believe can impact students' decision to further pursue a computational career. In this paper, we study how first-year undergraduate engineering students feel about the IDE they used in their first programming course at the university learning and working on different programming languages. The students are from various engineering majors with different demographics and experiences with programming and IDEs. We use the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to understand how different first-year undergraduate engineering majors with minimal or no prior coding experience find the experience of working with various IDEs. The study focuses on the IDEs used in a first-year programming course for engineering students. We collected and analyzed post-survey responses from 613 consenting students using an extended UTAUT framework that included constructs such as Self-Efficacy and Availability of Resources. We applied Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to evaluate the relationships between key factors that influenced students' acceptance and perception of IDEs. A multi-group SEM analysis was also performed to compare these perceptions across the different IDE groups. By ensuring that factors such as complexity of the IDE, its usability, and the support align with learner needs and backgrounds, the findings of this study offer practical insights for educators to choose the correct IDEs that cater to student backgrounds and technical readiness."

    "abstract": "This research WIP paper identified two research questions: How do faculty members perceive the benefits of using mobile devices as learning tools in engineering education? What are the faculty members' perceptions of the prospects of using mobile devices as learning tools in engineering education? Due to covid-19 pandemic, the use of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and notebooks in engineering education in Bangladesh has increased significantly. Will the faculty members sustain the use of mobile devices in the face-to-face teaching and learning contexts in engineering education at post-COVID? Alternatively, will they abandon the mobile devices like before the pandemic and adopt the traditional education tools in the face-to-face teaching practice? The concern elevated how mobile devices could be used in engineering education to promote authentic learning. The Mobile Learning Readiness Survey instrument was adopted as a data collection tool having emphasized four factors: benefits, future possibilities, preferences and external influence. An online questionnaire was sent to the faculty members via email and thereafter, 184 respondents filled the online survey. Data was analyzed quantitatively using descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation, and so forth. The study found that using mobile devices will improve twenty-first-century teaching and learning skills that will bring new education opportunities. Therefore, using these devices as learning tools in engineering education would be of great benefit. The outcome of this research will impact teaching and learning practices and improve the policy of using mobile devices in engineering education in Bangladesh and other similar contexts."

    "abstract": "This work-in-progress innovative practice paper explores a key reason why many engineering students drop out: rigid university course plans. A single failed class can derail a student for an entire year, a system especially tough for learners who struggle with long-term planning. To address this, we introduce a framework that acts as a personal academic guide. This guide faces a classic learning challenge: It must determine the best course for each student's unique situation (their “context”) by constantly and intelligently balancing what has worked for similar students in the past with trying new options to see if they might work even better. This formal learning problem is known as a contextual multi-armed bandit. Our framework applies this approach to power an adaptive course recommendation system to create a flexible roadmap for each student that adheres to ABET accreditation standards. We tested our bandit framework in an offline simulation on the Open University Learning Analytics (OULAD) dataset, a public record of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 2, 5 9 3}$</tex> students. To solve the balancing challenge, we used a statistical approach that intelligently weighs recommending proven, successful courses (exploitation) against suggesting new, uncertain ones to discover their potential (exploration); a method known as Thompson Sampling. This strategy reduced suboptimal course recommendations by 66% compared to a standard popularity-based method. The system also maintained algorithmic fairness across gender groups and demonstrated it'a potential for real-world scalability. This work demonstrates the practical application of reinforcement learning for a more supportive and successful educational experience."

Traditional urban systems, often operating in silos, are increasingly inadequate for addressing the complex, interconnected demands of sustainability, resilience, and quality of life. This paper posits that an AI-Driven Predictive Infrastructure constitutes the foundational pillar for the actualization of truly smart and sustainable cities. By integrating cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks, and heterogeneous urban data streams, this infrastructure leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning models to transition urban management from a static to a dynamic, anticipatory state. We examine the core architectural components of such an infrastructure, including its data acquisition, communication, computational analytics, and decision-support layers. The paper further elucidates the transformative applications of predictive AI across critical domains such as energy optimization, intelligent transportation systems, waste management, and water distribution, demonstrating its capacity to enhance operational efficiency, reduce environmental footprints, and improve civic engagement. Finally, we address significant implementation challenges, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and cybersecurity, while proposing a forward-looking research agenda to guide the development of equitable, robust, and selfhealing urban ecosystems."

Preparing data, updating the model, and generating ensemble forecasts provide crucial information. Early probe preparation and feature engineering are extensive. The procedure includes normalization, missing value estimations, one-hot categorical variable encoding, PCA, and LDA dimension reduction. Synthetic oversampling eliminates class distinctions and improves company service for repeat consumers. A clean, balanced, and feature-optimized prediction modeling dataset is segregated, evened out, and blended after cleaning. Iterative gradient descent, mini-batch optimization, regularization, momentum, and learning rate modifications may reduce overfitting and improve model training. Softmax functions determine event probabilities, while accuracy, cross-entropy loss, F1-score, and confusion matrices evaluate models. Combining many submodels leads to superior outcomes through ensemble learning. Gradient-based fine-tuning enhances the accuracy of weighted predictions. Based on value, this technique rates a customer's likelihood of staying with a firm. This lets you plan and target client retention activities. It outperforms other machine learning models in basic and complicated tasks. AUC, F1 scores, accuracy, precision, and memory matter most. G-mean, log loss, sensitivity, balancing accuracy, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient are advanced measurements. The findings demonstrate that the technique can identify complex consumer behavior and provide data-driven insights. Such analysis keeps organizations competitive in shifting marketplaces and promotes consumer trust."

This paper mainly considers two easily exposed data in the training process of split learning, namely the output data of the cut layer and the label of the data. In these two parts of the data, different algorithms of differential privacy are used to avoid the direct exposure of the data and protect the model privacy."

In this work, we observe that it can be favorable to decouple the estimation problem into the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths, carrying out an interleaved update of the three. By this means, fewer approximations are needed for the derivation, leading to vastly improved filtering. The resulting method can be computed in closed-form, and experiments show significantly improved tracking accuracy compared to the original EKF-based approach, as well as other state-of-the-art trackers."

Additionally, existing studies often overlook the impact of limited fronthaul capacity, which introduces noise and degrades the reliability of shared information. In this work, we implement a practical CF-mMIMO prototype under fifth generation new radio standards and propose a diffusion-based uplink scheme that outperforms conventional distributed cell-free systems without cooperation. Our approach adapts to arbitrary fronthaul topologies by leveraging the law of large numbers. We further analyze the linear effects of fronthaul noise and the correlation of uploaded data, demonstrating that the diffusion uplink excels in Rician fading environments while maintaining robust performance in Rayleigh fading. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ a diffusion model for mitigating fronthaul non-idealities, enabling distributed cooperative uplink in a real-world CF-mMIMO system."

The modeling core is a hybrid ensemble that combines gradient-boosted trees (LightGBM/XGBoost), a compact feed-forward network, and a lightweight sequence module (Transformer/LSTM), stacked via time-aware out-of-fold meta-learning. The data layer integrates end-of-day and intraday price feeds with fundamentals and optional news-sentiment features, using public APIs for live updates and Kaggle datasets for historical backfills. A cost-aware optimizer translates model scores into investable weights by jointly controlling risk (via Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage covariance, sector and name caps), turnover (L1 penalty and minimum holding periods), and target volatility. We conduct walk-forward, purged/embargoed validation on a liquid U.S. equity universe (multi-year horizon) and report predictive metrics (ROC/AUC, accuracy, RMSE/MAPE), portfolio outcomes (returns, Sharpe, drawdown), and operational characteristics (latency, rate-limit resilience). Results show that stacked ensembles are more robust than single models across regimes and that explicit turnover control preserves net performance under realistic frictions.

We evaluate machine translation tools for suitability in preserving contextual information in posts and find GPT-4 is most reliable. We leverage existing underground forum post classification pipelines to compare their performance on translated text and original language text. We find classification performed on translated underground forum data is as effective as on original language text, enabling researchers to reuse existing pipelines. Finally, we investigate a fully machine-generated few-shot and zero-shot classification to reduce reliance on manual labeling, followed by a two-step machine-based classification, combining machine-generated labels with the existing classification pipeline. We find machine-based labeling causes errors to propagate downstream. For tasks requiring high-quality label creation, human expertise remains essential.

This involves Mobile Network Operators (MNO), Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), and end users, where MNO leases network slices to MVNOs, and then provides customized services. This work considers end-to-end network slicing with a focus on fair sharing and financial-related power efficiency, modeled as a twolevel hierarchical combinatorial auction. At the upper level, an MNO auctions slices to competing MVNOs, while at the lower level, MVNOs allocate resources to end users through their own auctions. Dynamic user requests add complexity to the process. Our model optimizes resource allocation and revenue generation using a pair-bid mechanism and Vickrey-Clarke- Groves (VCG) pricing. The pair-bid approach enhances competition and efficiency, while VCG ensures truthful bidding based on marginal system impact. Simulations validate the model’s effectiveness in resource distribution and financial performance, showing a $\\mathbf{1 2. 5} \\boldsymbol{\\%}$ revenue improvement over the baseline."

    "abstract": "This full research paper explores undergraduate students' misconceptions of Dijkstra's algorithm quantitatively. Graph algorithm misconceptions have been studied to a modest extent, but they support effective instruction. A visual algorithm simulation (VAS) exercise requires a student to trace the algorithm by modifying a data structure visualization. We investigated effective ways to mine new algorithm misconceptions from VAS exercise data. In addition, we searched for previously unknown misconceptions of Dijkstra's algorithm. Students simulated Dijkstra's algorithm with a VAS exercise by adding edges of a given graph to a spanning tree. The simulations produced execution patterns which were mapped into a canonical form. We constructed another graph representing exercise states in all simulations. Using an interactive visualization of the state graph, we built hypotheses for misconceptions. The hypotheses were modeled as algorithms whose execution patterns were matched against students' simulations to find frequency of the hypothetical misconceptions. Pattern matching indicated that certain simulations resembled depth-first search, breadth-first search, and Prim's algorithm. Other simulations had evidence that students had understood the purpose of Dijkstra's algorithm, but arrived to the correct solution with ad hoc heuristics. The findings demonstrate how a VAS exercise was designed to reveal students' difficulties with graph algorithms. The methodology supports recognizing common misconceptions and therefore giving automated, formative feedback. The misconceptions itself are applicable to any exercise on elementary graph algorithms. Interactive visualization of an exercise state graph demonstrates the use of a new data-driven method for eliciting misconceptions."

    "abstract": "This research WIP paper introduces a study that explores an innovative approach to addressing racial equity in STEM education by focusing on the role of parents in shaping students' experiences and outcomes. Despite the growing body of research on racial disparities within STEM fields, little attention has been given to the influence of parental involvement on students' educational trajectories in STEM. This paper, falling under the “Diversity and Broadening Participation” track, examines how parents' engagement can support racial equity efforts in STEM pathways. The purpose of this study is to explore how parents' perspectives, resources, and involvement can influence racial equity in STEM education. Research questions include: How do parents of underrepresented racial groups perceive their role in supporting their children's STEM education? What are the challenges and opportunities associated with parent engagement in fostering racial equity in STEM fields? How can institutions and educators better support parents in this process? How do parents help prepare their children for careers in STEM fields. We planned a series of three related studies. All of the studies have not been completed, but the initial data is interesting and worthy of exploration."

    "abstract": "This research category full paper presents a lightweight, deployable Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline to automatically answer student forum questions about course logistics. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over course documents like the syllabus and calendar, our Llama 3.1-based model offers an accurate, low-cost alternative to commercial tools. In addition, many countries have strict student-privacy laws, making online third-party solutions difficult or impossible to gain approval for. Unlike large proprietary models, our pipeline runs on consumer hardware and avoids expensive API costs. We evaluated 159 authentic student forum questions across eleven Computer Science (CS) courses, showing that the model accurately answered 74% of logistical queries. Performance improved significantly when filtered by retrieval confidence scores above 0.5, allowing staff to easily identify questions needing review. To contextualize its effectiveness, we compared our pipeline to several state-of-the-art commercial models. While commercial tools slightly outperformed in raw accuracy, our model provided comparable results at a fraction of the computational and financial cost. This tradeoff makes our approach particularly well-suited for educational institutions seeking low-cost, scalable solutions compliant with student-privacy laws such as FERPA. Our findings support the use of lightweight LLMs for automating routine academic support, offering a viable and accessible path forward for institutions with limited infrastructure or privacy restrictions."

Despite their potential, existing NFT systems face challenges such as high transaction costs and uncertainties related to the management and transfer of associated physical assets. This paper introduces a decentralized marketplace architecture designed to address these challenges, by making use of blockchain-based smart contracts, decentralized storage solutions, and trustless validation mechanisms. The proposed system separates ownership from possession, ensuring secure and transparent asset transfers. The architecture was then tested in a blockchain-based environment, demonstrating its economic viability. This work paves the way for decentralized asset management across various domains, such as rental services and remote logistics. By addressing existing challenges, the proposed architecture provides a usable and cost-effective solution that links digital and physical asset ecosystems while preserving the fundamental principles of blockchain technology."

    "abstract": "Future 6 G networks are envisioned as a “network of networks” (NoN) ecosystem, integrating communication and computing resources across multiple domains. At the deep edge, IoT and end-user devices will form subnetworks for local communication and distributed task processing. These subnetworks will seamlessly integrate into the NoN ecosystem, creating an IoT-edge-cloud continuum. The unified resources across this continuum facilitate dynamic and scalable task offloading, unlocking new possibilities to support emerging services, including critical vertical services with stringent reliability and deterministic service level requirements. In this context, this paper demonstrates that a deterministic approach to task offloading and resource (communication and computing) allocation in the IoT-edge-cloud continuum not only ensures deterministic service levels but also enhances scalability compared to existing task offloading and resource allocation methods. By flexibly managing task completion deadlines while maintaining deterministic (i.e. bounded latency) service levels, deterministic policies achieve a more balanced workload and resource distribution across the continuum, ultimately improving scalability."

    "abstract": "The detection and analysis of features in fluid flow are important tasks in fluid mechanics and flow visualization. One recent class of methods to approach this problem is to first compute objective optimal reference frames, relative to which the input vector field becomes as steady as possible. However, existing methods either optimize locally over a fixed neighborhood, which might not match the extent of interesting features well, or perform global optimization, which is costly. We propose a novel objective method for the computation of optimal reference frames that automatically adapts to the flow field locally, without having to choose neighborhoods a priori. We enable adaptivity by formulating this problem as a moving least squares approximation, through which we determine a continuous field of reference frames. To incorporate fluid features into the computation of the reference frame field, we introduce the use of a scalar guidance field into the moving least squares approximation. The guidance field determines a curved manifold on which a regularly sampled input vector field becomes a set of irregularly spaced samples, which then forms the input to the moving least squares approximation. Although the guidance field can be any scalar field, by using a field that corresponds to flow features the resulting reference frame field will adapt accordingly. We show that using an FTLE field as the guidance field results in a reference frame field that adapts better to local features in the flow than prior work. However, our moving least squares framework is formulated in a very general way, and therefore other types of guidance fields could be used in the future to adapt to local fluid features."

A/B testing commonly uses click rate as a metric, but this metric can be affected by user bias, yielding inaccurate results. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can used to detect hidden state that affect A/B testing results, which is the bias itself. Through this research, we aim to provide a new solution to overcome user bias in A/B testing by changing the display frequency of each design variation using HMM, which may modify the display frequency of the design unequally and to minimize user bias. The implementation results showed that HMM successfully detected user bias and improved the validity of A/B testing results, an opened up further research opportunities on the application of HMM in software testing optimization."

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a distributed energy management strategy for multi-terminal energy storage integrated soft open points (ES-SOPs) to enable the flexible and coordinated operation of interconnected distribution networks (DNs) with high renewable penetration. We designed a bi-level distributed optimization framework to decompose the overall coordination problem into local DN operations and global ES-SOP management. The operational cost of each DN is minimized under relaxed reliability constraints using a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) formulation. The coordination layer minimizes the converter and battery losses and ensures a power balance between the battery and soft open points (SOPs). The DRCC approach addresses the PV and load forecast uncertainties without assuming specific distributions. The optimization problem is implemented using an analytical target cascading approach that ensures scalable convergence and preserves the DN independence. We conducted case studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in balancing the operational cost of the DNs and power grid reliability by varying the key parameters in the DRCC framework (i.e., ambiguity set radius and risk parameters)."

    "abstract": "This WIP research paper describes an ongoing qualitative phenomenological study that explores how doctoral education influences the development of non-technical competencies among early-career engineering faculty. Engineering faculty are expected not only to impart technical knowledge but also to mentor students, lead research projects, secure funding, and contribute to academic service and departmental governance all of which demand a diverse set of non-technical skills. While doctoral programs typically emphasize technical training, the development of competencies such as communication, leadership, collaboration, and teamwork is often underprioritized. Yet, these skills are essential for faculty to navigate their multifaceted roles and to foster similar competencies in their students. Prior research underscores the importance of these non-technical skills, but gaps remain in understanding how doctoral education supports their development. This study investigates the lived experiences of early-career engineering faculty to uncover how their graduate education contributed to their personal and professional transformations and shaped their preparedness for academic responsibilities. Preliminary findings offer insights into how graduate programs can more intentionally cultivate the non-technical competencies required for academic success and, ultimately, for advancing engineering education."

This study presents a multi-role, dialogue-based simulation system designed to enhance digital scam awareness through interactive learning in the Indonesian language (Bahasa Indonesia). Leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs), the system simulates scam messages, interprets user responses, and provides tailored feedback. The Scammer role, powered by zero-shot CoT, generated contextually realistic messages across four common types of fraud. Human evaluators rated the outputs highly for realism (avg. 4.2/5) and persuasiveness (4.0/5). The Evaluator role achieved an average accuracy of 84.5% in classifying user behavior (vigilant, unsure, deceived), with peak performance in fake prize scenarios (88%). The Educator role delivered rule-based feedback rated 4.5 for clarity, 4.4 for relevance, and 4.6 for educational value. This work demonstrates a scalable, adaptive, and linguistically inclusive approach to digital literacy. By simulating realistic scam interactions and incorporating pedagogical feedback, the system provides an effective anti-scam training tool for low-resource language users, promoting safe and responsible use of LLMs in public education."

Solar power, as a pivotal renewable resource, requires effective integration techniques to maximize utility and grid compatibility. This study investigates the integration of a 400 kW solar power generation system with the utility grid using a Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Using the Perturb and Observe method, the MPPT effectively harnesses optimal power from photovoltaic (PV) arrays, ensuring efficient energy conversion. The MMC, composed of multiple submodules, generates a multilevel AC output with minimal harmonic distortion, achieving a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of less than $5 \\%$. The boost converter successfully steps up the PV array voltage to 2000 V, and the output voltage stabilizes within 0.8 seconds. The MMC ensures high-quality power delivery, and the system produces a consistent three-phase output with minimal distortion, improving overall power quality and grid stability. This scalable and reliable approach enhances the performance of solar power systems connected to the grid, maintaining stability even under fluctuating environmental conditions."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of data traffic in indoor environments demands wireless connectivity solutions that are not only high-performing but also efficient in terms of cost and resource utilization. Conventional network models with duplicated infrastructure among telecommunication operators face significant challenges related to scalability, high capital expenditure (CAPEX), and operational expenditure (OPEX). This study proposes a comprehensive framework for implementing a multi-operator Neutral Host (NH) model based on Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) technology. The framework is designed to provide a multi-dimensional analysis across three key pillars: policy and regulation, technical performance, and economic efficiency. Through a systematic literature review, it has been identified that sharing active and passive infrastructure has the potential to reduce CAPEX by up to 60% and significantly lower OPEX. Wi-Fi 6, with its superior features such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Target Wake Time (TWT), and Basic Service Set (BSS) Coloring, provides an ideal technical foundation to support multi-tenant environments with guaranteed spectrum efficiency and Quality of Service (QoS). This paper proposes a structured conceptual framework that integrates regulatory, technical, and economic perspectives, serving as a strategic reference for regulators, operators, and property owners in advancing sustainable and future-ready indoor connectivity, with the clear expectation of fostering greater efficiency in both cost structures and resource utilization."

The paper presents a new blockchain-based smart contract platform that automates and simplifies insurance claim settlements through the combination of non-mutable distributed ledger technology and self-executable digital contracts. The presented approach will guarantee transparency since all events associated with claims will be recorded in the blockchain, thereby serving auditable and tamper-proof information which can be accessed by all stakeholders. Smart contracts are coded to ensure that claim conditions are met, triggered automated compensation on meeting policy criteria and the removal of human interaction in the process of decision making, so fraudulent practices and operational expenses are reduced to a minimum. Moreover, this strategy builds customer trust by providing real-time information and decentralized management. The efficiency of the system is measured in terms of transaction speed, cost effectiveness and reduction of fraud and this proves to be much better than the traditional conventional models that are centralized. In this study, the author has identified the revolutionary nature of blockchain to bring change in the insurance industry, a situation where claims can be settled through secure, transparent, and efficient methods."

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization and the rise of vehicles have caused major problems such as congestion, air pollution, and high energy consumption. In order to build sustainable Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), traffic management has become extremely important. Due to the large amount of data transmitted to central servers, traditional centralized systems suffer from communication delays, data privacy risks, and high energy consumption. In order to address these issues, this paper introduces a framework for Energy-Aware Federated Learning (EAFL). Edge devices work together to train multiple models without sending raw data anywhere. This keeps the data private and keeps the traffic on the network low. EAFL relies on the Hybrid Grey Wolf Optimizer - Firefly Algorithm. The method blends the wide search of the Grey Wolf Optimizer with the fine search of the Firefly Algorithm - the training step becomes faster plus more precise. The algorithm tunes the model parameters - every device spends less time and less power on the task. Simulations show that the HGWO-FA version of EAFL outperforms standard federated learning but also any single alternative approach. It cuts model loss, power draw and delay, which raises prediction accuracy. The framework offers a practical as well as low-impact way to predict and manage traffic in real time inside a smart city."

    "abstract": "The efficient and independent operation of power-over-fiber (PoF) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has been demonstrated using standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). An optical power transmission efficiency (OPTE) of 6.67% and a transmission loss of ~1 dB/km were achieved over an 11.8 km fiber link, supporting both power delivery and distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS). To minimize cross-talk, the system separates the power and sensing channels by an 88 THz bandwidth. In the experiment, the power and sensing light wavelengths are 1064 nm (continuous) and 1550 nm (pulsed), respectively. As the transmitted optical power increased from 0 W to 2.13 W, the DAS system successfully localized vibration sources with a resolution of 6.29 m and reconstructed phase information, confirming its ability to operate under high optical power. The reported scheme verifies the possibility of constructing the sensing-energy hybrid network based on a conventional optical fiber with the advantages of flexible layout and compatibility."

    "abstract": "Multimodal ultrasound imaging, combining B-mode ultrasound, shear wave velocity, and shear wave time, is crucial for diagnosing and treating breast lesions, providing insights into lesion characteristics and tissue properties. However, challenges arise from intermodal feature misalignment and attention shifts due to varied capture methods and an overemphasis on vibrant color data. To tackle these issues, we introduce two innovations: a novel segmentation framework and a comprehensive dataset. The UltraMamba framework utilizes bidirectional alignment between modalities and enhances region-specific information to improve breast lesion segmentation accuracy. Key components include the Cross-Modal Knowledge Interaction module for robust information exchange and the Region-Aware Feature Excitation module to focus on relevant features. We also present the BreLS dataset, the first two-dimensional multimodal ultrasound breast lesion dataset, with paired images from 506 cases, serving as a valuable resource for analysis. UltraMamba shows strong performance on the BreLS dataset, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 72.16% and an HD95 of 42.02 mm, reflecting improvements of 2.59% in DSC and a 6.78 mm reduction in HD95 compared to the second-best framework, MMCA-NET. These results highlight UltraMamba’s potential to enhance segmentation accuracy in clinical settings, facilitating precise treatment planning and, ultimately, leading to improved outcomes.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a research work that is novel in nature, based on a new machine learning framework that focuses on a computational analysis in the field of English literature. This research uniquely aims at focusing on an intersection based on stylistic patterns and narrative structures. The newly proposed model is termed the “Next Gen Text Mining Framework”, which leverages transformer-based models (such as GPT, BERT), along with sentiment trajectory-based modeling, network analysis, and clustering algorithms for extracting stylistic features and latent semantics from the text on a large scale. A meticulously used re-processing type pipelining framework modifies and prepares the data for the model ingestion. The multi-modal approach used in this framework enables the experimental analysis of different models across various diverse corpora in the literature that demonstrate stability, superior accuracy, and robustness when compared to the traditional models, in tasks like the authorship attribution, sentimental trajectory mapping, and the theme-based classification. The proposed framework bridges the gap between distant and close reading practices, enhancing the pedagogically based engagements and translating the computational insights into interpretative forms for research and teaching. This research highlights a scalable and replicable framework model that is a transformative tool when a large-scale inquiry in literature is considered and sets a foundation towards multi-modal, future, cross-lingual, and multidisciplinary-based applications."

    "abstract": "Early detection of pest infestations plays a critical role in improving crop health management and reducing yield losses, particularly in leafy vegetables such as Caisim mustard greens. This study proposes an automated pest damage detection system leveraging the YOLOv8 object detection model, optimized through the Optuna framework for hyperparameter tuning. A custom dataset comprising 215 annotated images, sourced from field collection and public repositories, was used to train and validate the model. Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques, including image rotation, flipping, noise addition, and color adjustments, were applied to enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8 achieves high detection accuracy in identifying damage caused by caterpillars and grasshoppers, with strong generalization to unseen samples. To facilitate practical adoption, the optimized model was deployed in a mobile application, providing real-time pest detection and supporting field-based decision-making. This research highlights the potential of integrating deep learning with mobile technology to advance precision agriculture and deliver accessible pest monitoring solutions."

    "abstract": "Track evaluation in sensor data fusion typically relies on assignment-based ground truth association to compute metrics. Although widely adopted, this approach overlooks temporal continuity and can produce misleading performance assessments. This paper highlights the differences and presents a systematic comparison of assignment-based and time-based association in metric computation, with a focus on the target completeness metric, and offers guidance for researchers and practitioners to achieve more reproducible and comparable results. An evaluation is also formed from the perspective of different output frequency of the trackers and its impact on the final metric score. The results show that inconsistencies created using the assignment-based approach can easily reach beyond 20 %. Explanation of when this could happen, how to decide if it happens in a given situation, and the strategy of how to fix this, is provided."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia is an infection that results in inflammation of the lungs and, if not identified in time, can be life-threatening. The most frequent method of diagnosing pneumonia is chest X-rays; the pictures are scrutinized closely. Pneumonia is still a global health burden. The accurate and timely diagnosis is difficult, especially in low-resource settings. X-rays have served as a primary key for the identification of pneumonia for many years. However, with the recent advancement in artificial intelligence technologies, especially deep learning and machine learning, there's now a potential to automatically detect and classify pneumonia using chest x-ray images. This review examines the research from 2019 to 2024 to understand the current trends and future direction in various deep learning and machine learning models. These encompass the convolutional neural networks, transfer learning methods, combined network designs, explainable AI models, and the use of radiomics with conventional machine learning techniques. However, the three significant challenges remain differences in the data, an imbalance between the classes, and a limited ability to apply these methods in real clinical settings. Based on the review, this paper suggests more future research on machine learning techniques for detecting pneumonia. In this work, a new system is also introduced to improve both case identification and the clinical diagnosis process. The proposed model was evaluated using the Key Parameter Indicator (KPI) as a feature and was compared with an earlier model. Finally, recommendations are provided for future research on trustworthiness, clinical usefulness, and multi-modal AI systems."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a framework of Blockchain-powered Supply Chain Automation is proposed and enacted which would offer real-time traceability, transparency, and security of distributed trade networks. The suggested system implements Hyperledger Fabric with a data acquisition layer of IoT to get valid products information in every node of the transaction. The smart contracting approach can have this framework automate Facebook processes of validation, authorization and data logging without an overall system that will enable the determination of records without tampering. A consensus-based validation protocol contributes to consistency besides minimizing the latency of the transactions. Moreover, anomaly detection by machine learning is added to complete predictive bottlenecks analysis and authorization of fraud. The simulated logistics data performance analysis reveals that it has enhanced the traceability efficiency by 24.6 %, data tampering risks by 31.8 % and verification time by 18.4 % relative to the supply chain systems using the traditional ERP. The findings confirm the appropriateness of the system to enable end-to-end visibility and operational resilience, which makes blockchain technology a game changer to next generation autonomous supply chain ecosystems."

    "abstract": "With the accelerated advancement of smart grid construction, the power system's requirements for the accuracy and real-time performance of line topology have become increasingly stringent. Traditional topology modeling methods rely on manual rules and static parameters, making it difficult to adapt to the dynamic changes of complex power grids and the efficient processing of massive data. This paper proposes a line topology model based on graph convolutional neural networks, which automatically extracts the spatial features and connection relationships of grid topology through deep learning, and constructs dynamic graph structures by combining node attributes and edge weights. The research focuses on designing multi-layer graph convolution operators to capture local and global topological features, while introducing an attention mechanism to optimize the efficiency of information transfer between nodes. Experiments demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of topology recognition accuracy and anti-interference capability, while also exhibiting excellent generalization and scalability. The research results provide reliable theoretical support for real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis in smart grids, while also opening up new technical pathways for complex network topology modeling."
