    "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain."

    "abstract": "We revisit the use of probabilistic values, which include the well-known Shapley and Banzhaf values, to rank features for explaining the local predicted values of decision trees. The quality of feature rankings is typically assessed with the insertion and deletion metrics. Empirically, we observe that co-optimizing these two metrics is closely related to a joint optimization that selects a subset of features to maximize the local predicted value while minimizing it for the complement. However, we theoretically show that probabilistic values are generally unreliable for solving this joint optimization. Therefore, we explore deriving feature rankings by directly optimizing the joint objective. As the backbone, we propose TreeGrad, which computes the gradients of the multilinear extension of the joint objective in $O(L)$ time for decision trees with $L$ leaves; these gradients include weighted Banzhaf values. Building upon TreeGrad, we introduce TreeGrad-Ranker, which aggregates the gradients while optimizing the joint objective to produce feature rankings, and TreeGrad-Shap, a numerically stable algorithm for computing Beta Shapley values with integral parameters. In particular, the feature scores computed by TreeGrad-Ranker satisfy all the axioms uniquely characterizing probabilistic values, except for linearity, which itself leads to the established unreliability. Empirically, we demonstrate that the numerical error of Linear TreeShap can be up to $10^{15}$ times larger than that of TreeGrad-Shap when computing the Shapley value. As a by-product, we also develop TreeProb, which generalizes Linear TreeShap to support all probabilistic values. In our experiments, TreeGrad-Ranker performs significantly better on both insertion and deletion metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/watml/TreeGrad."

    "abstract": "The security foundation of blockchain system relies primarily on classical cryptographic methods and consensus algorithms. However, the advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to conventional public-key cryptosystems based on computational hardness assumptions. In particular, Shor's algorithm can efficiently solve discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems in polynomial time, thereby undermining the immutability and security guarantees of existing systems. Moreover, current Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocols, widely adopted in consortium blockchains, suffer from high communication overhead and limited efficiency when coping with dynamic node reconfigurations, while offering no intrinsic protection against quantum adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose QDBFT, a quantum-secured dynamic consensus algorithm, with two main contributions: first,we design a primary node automatic rotation mechanism based on a consistent hash ring to enable consensus under dynamic membership changes, ensuring equitable authority distribution; second, we integrate Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks to provide message authentication for inter-node communication, thereby achieving information-theoretic security in the consensus process. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that QDBFT achieves performance comparable to traditional PBFT while delivering strong resilience against quantum attacks, making it a promising solution for future quantum-secure decentralized infrastructures."

The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\\lesssim 2$~s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \\times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\\mathrm{s} \\leq τ\\lesssim 15~\\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\lesssim 0.10$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case. We highlight that continuous monitoring observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow could be a key strategy to unveil a new population of optical transients on timescales of seconds or less."

The detection efficiency, energy resolution, and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance ofSG101 were evaluated under AmBe neutron irradiation. When coupled with organic scintillators(EJ200 or EJ276),the SG101 EJ200 system achieves a figure of merit (FOM) of 3.81 for thermal neutron/gamma separation, while the SG101 EJ276 configuration resolves three distinct particle populations gamma rays, fast neutrons, and thermal neutrons with FOM values of 3.46 and2.21, respectively. Correlation analysis reveals that the number of fast thermal neutron coincidence events significantly exceeds the accidental background, and the count of gamma fast thermal neutron triple-coincidence events is also far higher than the expected accidental rate, confirming significant physical correlations for both event types within a 100 us time window. These results demonstrate that SG101 is a promising candidate for applications requiring high-efficiency thermal neutron detection and precise event tagging coupling with a scintillator with PSD approach"

    "abstract": "It is commonly believed that gradient compression in federated learning (FL) enjoys significant improvement in communication efficiency with negligible performance degradation. In this paper, we find that gradient compression induces sharper loss landscapes in federated learning, particularly under non-IID data distributions, which suggests hindered generalization capability. The recently emerging Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) effectively searches for a flat minima by incorporating a gradient ascent step (i.e., perturbing the model with gradients) before the celebrated stochastic gradient descent. Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Modeling ultra-long user behavior sequences is pivotal for capturing evolving and lifelong interests in modern recommendation systems. However, deploying such models in real-time industrial environments faces a strict \"Latency Wall\", constrained by two distinct bottlenecks: the high I/O latency of retrieving massive user histories and the quadratic computational complexity of standard attention mechanisms. To break these bottlenecks, we present LASER, a full-stack optimization framework developed and deployed at Xiaohongshu (RedNote). Our approach tackles the challenges through two complementary innovations: (1) System efficiency: We introduce SeqVault, a unified schema-aware serving infrastructure for long user histories. By implementing a hybrid DRAM-SSD indexing strategy, SeqVault reduces retrieval latency by 50% and CPU usage by 75%, ensuring millisecond-level access to full real-time and life-cycle user histories. (2) Algorithmic efficiency: We propose a Segmented Target Attention (STA) mechanism to address the computational overhead. Motivated by the inherent sparsity of user interests, STA employs a sigmoid-based gating strategy that acts as a silence mechanism to filter out noisy items. Subsequently, a lightweight Global Stacked Target Attention (GSTA) module refines these compressed segments to capture cross-segment dependencies without incurring high computational costs. This design performs effective sequence compression, reducing the complexity of long-sequence modeling while preserving critical signals. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate that LASER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In large-scale online A/B testing serving over 100 million daily active users, LASER achieved a 2.36% lift in ADVV and a 2.08% lift in revenue, demonstrating its scalability and significant commercial impact."

We first build queue models for both battery charging and thermal dynamics. Then, we formulate an optimization problem, which allows us to coordinate battery charging and heating through maintaining queue stability. To solve the problem, we develop an online control algorithm within the theoretical framework of Lyapunov optimization. Note that our online method is prediction-free and independent of any assumed modeling of uncertainty. We also characterize both the feasibility and optimality of the proposed control approach. Numerical results based on real-world data corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our control method through comparisons."

The hierarchical clustering method provides formal identification with 3,863 members, but this set also includes objects from the neighboring Koronis2 and Kuitaisi families, as well as interlopers originating from the much older Koronis family. By tracking the trajectories of cluster objects backward in time, we identified 2,161 asteroids whose orbits converged with that of their parent body (832) Karin at $5.72\\pm 0.09$ My ago ($95$\\% C.L.). This method of calculating the family's age is based on a novel convergence metric that is directly related to the velocities at which fragments were ejected from (832) Karin. We analyze the extent to which members $\\leq 1.5$ km in diameter had drifted in semimajor axis due to Yarkovsky thermal forces and find it reflects the tilt of their rotation poles away from the ecliptic, recording the influence of the YORP torque. Karin's size frequency distribution in the $\\simeq(0.8-3)$ km range follows a power-law with a cumulative slope index $-3.20\\pm 0.01$. Removing members of the Karin family from the original group, we examine the Koronis2 family, whose members are associated with (158) Koronis. We find it difficult for large members of the Koronis2 family to converge with the orbit of (158) Koronis within its previously estimated age of $7.6$ My. Achieving such convergence would require the Koronis2 family to be older than $10$ My, but our result must be verified with a direct numerical approach in the future."

For a fixed sender network, we establish component-wise finite-time flocking results under both integrable and non-integrable communication weights. When communication weight function is non-integrable, finite-time flocking is guaranteed for any bounded initial configuration. We further extend the flocking analysis to switching sender networks and show that finite-time flocking persists under mild assumptions on the cumulative influence of time-varying sender weights. The proposed framework is also applicable to both finite and infinite systems, and it yields alignment-time estimates that do not depend on the number of agents."

Density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations reveal that, among the halogenated systems considered, only Br- and I-functionalized Mo2C monolayers are dynamically stable, as confirmed by positive definite phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone. Electronic structure calculations show metallic behavior with states near the Fermi level dominated by Mo d orbitals with pronounced electronic density of states, providing favorable conditions for strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). The resulting EPC constants place both systems in the strong coupling regime, yielding superconducting transition temperatures of Tc = 13.1 K for Mo2CBr2 and Tc = 18.1 K for Mo2CI2 within the Allen-Dynes formalism. Notably, halogen functionalization itself plays a crucial role in enhancing superconductivity in Mo2C, which has Tc = 7.2 K, leading to a substantial increase in the superconducting transition temperature compared with pristine Mo2C through strengthened electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that superconductivity in these systems is highly tunable via carrier doping and biaxial tensile strain. Electron doping significantly enhances EPC and raises Tc up to 21.7 K for Mo2CBr2 and 21.3 K for Mo2CI2. Our results identify halogen-functionalized Mo2C MXenes as mechanically robust, phonon mediated two dimensional superconductors and highlight carrier doping as an effective strategy for optimizing their superconducting performance."

    "abstract": "In decentralized networks, nodes cannot ensure that their shared information will be securely preserved by their neighbors, making privacy vulnerable to inference by curious nodes. Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms."

This allows the system to switch from a perfect dark state, governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum, to a critically coupled resonance with a finite Q factor. Consequently, the metasurface exhibits perfect absorption in the amorphous state and a reflection-dominated response in the crystalline state. The proposed metasurface holds significant potential for diverse nanophotonic applications, including photodetection and thermal emission control."

Understanding the origins of their orbital architectures requires examining both their migration histories and subsequent dynamical interactions. In this study, we perform extensive N-body simulations to explore how distant giant planet perturbers affect the eccentricity evolution of warm Jupiters and the role of nearby super-Earth companions in mediating these interactions. We find that while distant perturbers can induce large-amplitude eccentricity oscillations in warm Jupiters via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, the presence of nearby super-Earth companions often suppresses these variations via strong dynamical coupling. This mechanism naturally leads to a bimodal eccentricity distribution: warm Jupiters with nearby companions tend to maintain low eccentricities, whereas those without exhibit significantly broader eccentricity distributions. We show that reproducing the observed eccentricity distribution of warm Jupiters lacking nearby companions is most naturally explained if a substantial fraction of distant perturbers occupy dynamically extreme orbits, either with large mutual inclinations or high orbital eccentricities. These results support a scenario in which warm Jupiters experience substantial post-disk dynamical evolution, shaped jointly by distant perturbers and nearby companions."

Current solutions independently address these issues through separate regularization strategies, specifically a KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) to mitigate reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$) to promote stable alignment. However, the implicit trade-off arising from simultaneously regularizing towards both $π_0$ and $π_t$ remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances the objectives of preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. Our simple yet principled alignment objective yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with a superior trade-off, which demonstrably improves both alignment results and implementation complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate that our method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability."

    "abstract": "E-commerce search serves as a central interface, connecting user demands with massive product inventories and plays a vital role in our daily lives. However, in real-world applications, it faces challenges, including highly ambiguous queries, noisy product texts with weak semantic order, and diverse user preferences, all of which make it difficult to accurately capture user intent and fine-grained product semantics. In recent years, significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for semantic representation and contextual reasoning have created new opportunities to address these challenges. Nevertheless, existing e-commerce search datasets still suffer from notable limitations: queries are often heuristically constructed, cold-start users and long-tail products are filtered out, query and product texts are anonymized, and most datasets cover only a single stage of the search pipeline. Collectively, these issues constrain research on LLM-based e-commerce search. To address these challenges, we construct and release KuaiSearch. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest e-commerce search dataset currently available. KuaiSearch is built upon real user search interactions from the Kuaishou platform, preserving authentic user queries and natural-language product texts, covering cold-start users and long-tail products, and systematically spanning three key stages of the search pipeline: recall, ranking, and relevance judgment. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of KuaiSearch from multiple perspectives, including products, users, and queries, and establish benchmark experiments across several representative search tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that KuaiSearch provides a valuable foundation for research on real-world e-commerce search."

    "abstract": "Autonomous shuttles (AS) are fully autonomous transit vehicles with operating characteristics distinct from conventional autonomous vehicles (AV). Developing dedicated car-following models for AS is critical to understanding their traffic impacts; however, few studies have calibrated such models with field data. More advanced machine learning (ML) techniques have not yet been applied to AS trajectories, leaving the potential of ML for capturing AS dynamics unexplored and constraining the development of dedicated AS models. Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified framework for systematically evaluating and comparing the performance of car-following models to replicate real trajectories. Existing car-following studies often rely on disparate metrics, which limit reproducibility and performance comparability. This study addresses these gaps through two main contributions: (1) the calibration of a diverse set of car-following models using real-world AS trajectory data, including eight machine learning algorithms and two physics-based models; and (2) the introduction of a multi-criteria evaluation framework that integrates measures of prediction accuracy, trajectory stability, and statistical similarity, which provides a generalizable methodology for a systematic assessment of car-following models. Results indicated that the proposed calibrated XGBoost model achieved the best overall performance. Sequential model type, such as LSTM and CNN, captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. LSTM and CNN captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. Traditional models (IDM, ACC) and kernel methods showed lower accuracy and stability than most ML models tested."

    "abstract": "Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%."

    "abstract": "Volumetric lithography offers a path to scalable fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanoscale architectures, yet existing approaches are limited by quasi-two-dimensional exposure physics or slow serial writing. We present a single-exposure volumetric fabrication strategy that enables creation of ultrahigh-aspect-ratio 3D structures with 6 um minimum features. An inverse-designed volumetric (holographic) phase mask generates an extended-depth-of-field intensity distribution inside a photoresist volume while preserving high transverse resolution, enabling uniform polymerization of the full volume in a single exposure. With exposure times of approximately 20 s, we fabricate lattices, Penrose tilings, and micromechanical elements with feature sizes down to 6 um over volumes up to 800 x 800 x 720 um^3, achieving aspect ratios exceeding 120:1. Quantitative analysis of capillary flow in hollow lattices demonstrates controlled fluid transport with an effective capillary transport coefficient of 176.3 um/(ms)^(1/2). In situ nanoindentation-based micro-compression reveals that the printed 3D hexagonal close-packed lattices exhibit a well-defined linear elastic regime with an effective Young's modulus of 5.7 GPa, followed by progressive buckling and densification characteristic of mechanically robust cellular architectures. Overlapping, tilted and multi-mask exposures further enable quasi-3D complex geometries with potential for reconfigurability. This approach establishes a new regime of high-throughput volumetric fabrication."

    "abstract": "Level 3 automated driving systems (ADS) have attracted significant attention and are being commercialized. A level 3 ADS prompts the driver to take control by issuing a request to intervene (RtI) when its operational design domains (ODD) are exceeded. However, complex traffic situations can cause drivers to perceive multiple potential triggers of RtI simultaneously, causing hesitation or confusion during take-over. Therefore, drivers need to clearly understand the ADS's system limitations to ensure safe take-over. This study proposes a voice-based educational human machine interface~(HMI) for providing RtI trigger cues and reason to help drivers understand ADS's system limitations. The results of a between-group experiment using a driving simulator showed that incorporating effective trigger cues and reason into the RtI was related to improved driver comprehension of the ADS's system limitations. Moreover, most participants, instructed via the proposed method, could proactively take over control of the ADS in cases where RtI fails; meanwhile, their number of collisions was lower compared with the other RtI HMI conditions. Therefore, using the proposed method to continually enhance the driver's understanding of the system limitations of ADS through the proposed method is associated with safer and more effective real-time interactions with ADS."

Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of polarization-strain coupling and spatially heterogeneous energy dissipation in van der Waals ferroelectrics under ultrafast excitation."

In this work, we present a novel framework that makes the PCCT imaging chain end-to-end differentiable (differentiable PCCT), with which we can leverage quantitative information in the image domain to enable cross-domain learning and optimization for upstream models. Specifically, the material decomposition from maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) was made differentiable based on the Implicit Function Theorem and inserted as a layer into the imaging chain for end-to-end optimization. This framework allows for an automatic and adaptive solution of a wide range of imaging tasks, ultimately achieving quantitative imaging through computation rather than manual intervention. The end-to-end training mechanism effectively avoids the need for direct-domain training or supervision from intermediate references as models are trained using quantitative images. We demonstrate its applicability in two representative tasks: correcting detector energy bin drift and training an object scatter correction network using cross-domain reference from quantitative material images."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for recovering sparse vectors from linear models corrupted by Poisson noise. The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem."

By including contributions from $t$-channel $K^*$ and $u$-channel $Σ$ exchanges, we perform global fits to the total and differential cross sections for $π^{-} p \\rightarrow KΛ(1405)$ and $π^{-} p \\rightarrow KΛ(1520)$. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $Λ(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $Λ(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $Λ(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $Λ(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $Λ^* \\to πΣ$, the Dalitz process $π^{-} p \\rightarrow K Λ^{*} \\rightarrow K πΣ$ is also calculated. Our results demonstrate that reconstructing $Λ^*$ via the $KπΣ$ final state is experimentally feasible. This study provides important theoretical insights into the production dynamics of these hyperon resonances, and suggests future high-precision measurements of the $t$-distribution at large momentum transfer at facilities such as AMBER, J-PARC, HIKE, and HIAF, which can further clarify their reaction mechanisms and structural properties."

    "abstract": "Generative large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized multiple domains. Modern LLMs predominantly rely on an autoregressive decoding strategy, which generates output tokens sequentially and employs a key-value cache (KV cache) to avoid redundant computation. However, the widespread deployment of LLMs has raised serious privacy concerns, as users are feeding all types of data into the model, motivating the development of secure inference frameworks based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). A major limitation of existing FHE-based frameworks is their inability to effectively integrate the KV cache, resulting in prohibitively high latency for autoregressive decoding. In this paper, we propose Cachemir, a KV Cache Accelerated Homomorphic Encrypted LLM Inference Regime to overcome this limitation. Cachemir comprises three key technical contributions: 1) a set of novel HE packing algorithms specifically designed to leverage the computational advantages of the KV cache; 2) an interleaved replicated packing algorithm to efficiently compute the vector-matrix multiplications that result from using the KV cache in Transformer linear layers; and 3) an augmented bootstrapping placement strategy that accounts for the KV cache to minimize bootstrapping cost. We demonstrate that Cachemir achieves $48.83\\times$ and $67.16\\times$ speedup over MOAI (ICML'25) and THOR (CCS'25) respectively on CPU and consumes less than 100 seconds on GPU to generate an output token for Llama-3-8B."

Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering.

A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability."

We explicitly model Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) where liquidators manipulate the CPMM with sandwich attacks to trigger profitable liquidation events. We derive closed-form liquidation bounds and prove that CPMM transaction fees act as a critical security parameter. Crucially, we demonstrate that fees do not merely reduce attacker profits, but can make such manipulations unprofitable for an attacker.

    "abstract": "The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container."

    "abstract": "Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making."

Its modular slotting system enables stable reconfiguration, including the integration of an adjustable magnetic field module. The temperature is maintained via a water-based heating and cooling loop supplemented by resistive elements, and the solvent vapor environment is regulated using a commercial controlled mixing and evaporation unit. The performance of the setup is validated through measurements of fill and quench times together with magnetic field mapping with Gauss meter measurements and finite element simulations. Further, the versatility of the setup is demonstrated with four research examples using the chamber for solvothermal vapor annealing of block copolymer thin films together with lab-based ex situ and in situ GISAXS measurements. The portable new design offers robust environmental control and flexibility for advanced thin film investigations both in the lab and at large scale facilities.

The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\\text{UV}+h_c^\\text{IR}\\in\\frac12\\mathbb Z$.

We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling."

In this manuscript, we present an Enhanced Forest Inventory (EFI) and demonstrate its utility for high-resolution wildlife habitat mapping. The project area covers 270,000 acres of the Eldorado National Forest in California's Sierra Nevada. By integrating 118 ground-truth Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots with multi-modal remote sensing data (LiDAR, aerial photography, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery), we developed predictive models for key forest attributes. Our methodology employed a two-tier segmentation approach, partitioning the landscape into approximately 575,000 reporting units with an average size of 0.5 acre to capture forest heterogeneity. We utilized an Elastic-Net Regression framework and automated feature selection to relate remote sensing metrics to ground-measured variables such as basal area, stems per acre, and canopy cover. These physical metrics were translated into functional habitat attributes to evaluate suitability for two focal species: the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and the Pacific Fisher (Pekania pennanti). Our analysis identified 25,630 acres of nesting and 26,622 acres of foraging habitat for the owl, and 25,636 acres of likely habitat for the fisher based on structural requirements like large-diameter trees and high canopy closure. The results demonstrate that EFIs provide a critical bridge between forestry and conservation ecology, offering forest managers a spatially explicit tool to monitor ecosystem health and manage vulnerable species in complex environments."

    "abstract": "We present the modeling results of the thermal lightcurve of asteroid (3) Juno at the wavelength of $λ$ = 1.3 mm measured by the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array. A thermophysical model together with a radiative transfer model suggest a thermal inertia of 13$\\pm$10 [J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-0.5}$], an equivalent emissivity of 0.8$\\pm$0.1, a loss tangent of 0.4$\\pm$0.3, and an index of refraction 1.8$\\pm$0.3. Based on previous laboratory measurements, the modeled index of refraction suggests a regolith porosity of about 45%. However, thermal inertia models using the material parameters of ordinary chondrite indicate a grain size of 10s $μ$m and require a high porosity of $\\sim$90% to explain the low thermal inertia. In order to explain such a contradiction, we postulate that some repulsive mechanism might be in effect to reduce the contact of grains and therefore the thermal inertia. The loss tangent of Juno's regolith corrected for the modeled thermal skin depth is in the order of 0.5, much higher than that of the lunar regolith and indicating an electrical skin depth of L = 0.1 - 1.4 mm that is within the thermal skin depth. The shape of the rotational lightcurve of Juno in the mm wavelengths is dominated by its irregular shape, but rotational variations in the thermal and/or dielectric properties cannot be ruled out. Our results demonstrate that mm-wavelength observations of asteroids provide an extra dimension of constraints to the porosity and grain size of asteroid regolith compared to the thermal infrared observations."

Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning."

Its ultra-reliable low-latency configuration targets round-trip times below 1 ms, while optional security controls extend protection across all interfaces, making 5G attractive for mission-critical applications. A key enabler of low latency is the disaggregation of network components, including the RAN, allowing user-plane functions to be deployed nearer to end users. However, this split introduces additional interfaces, whose protection increases latency overhead. In this paper, guided by discussions with a network operator and a 5G manufacturer, we evaluate the latency overhead of enabling optional 5G security controls across internal RAN interfaces and the 5G user plane. To this end, we deploy the first testbed implementing a disaggregated RAN with standardized optional security mechanisms. Our results show that disaggregated RAN deployments retain a latency advantage over monolithic designs, even with security enabled. However, achieving sub-1 ms round-trip times remains challenging, as cryptographic overhead alone can already exceed this target."

Although the TLA+ Toolbox includes a state diagram viewer, it offers only a static, fully expanded graph without folding, color highlighting, or semantic explanations, which limits its scalability and interpretability. We present ModelWisdom, an interactive environment that uses visualization and large language models to make TLA+ model checking more interpretable and actionable. ModelWisdom offers: (i) Model Visualization, with colorized violation highlighting, click-through links from transitions to TLA+ code, and mapping between violating states and broken properties; (ii) Graph Optimization, including tree-based structuring and node/edge folding to manage large models; (iii) Model Digest, which summarizes and explains subgraphs via large language models (LLMs) and performs preprocessing and partial explanations; and (iv) Model Repair, which extracts error information and supports iterative debugging. Together, these capabilities turn raw model-checker output into an interactive, explainable workflow, improving understanding and reducing debugging effort for nontrivial TLA+ specifications.

Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization."

For Gaussian data, or whenever logits are sufficiently clustered, we prove that logit clustering drives the weight vector to align exactly with Fisher's Linear Discriminant. To demonstrate the consequences, we study a simple signal-plus-noise model in which this transition has dramatic effects: Logit regularization halves the critical sample complexity and induces grokking in the small-noise limit, while making generalization robust to noise. Our results extend the theoretical understanding of label smoothing and highlight the efficacy of a broader class of logit-regularization methods."

To connect robust behavior with non-trivial topological features present already in the dynamics of individual units, here we introduce the topological chiral random walker (TCRW) model. While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%."

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively."

A major challenge is that while the pseudoscalar-meson couplings are well-determined, the couplings for scalar- and vector-meson exchanges render significant model dependence. To ensure the reliability of our predictions and reduce model dependence, we recalibrate the coupling constants of the OBE model. We treat the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$, or equivalently the scalar $σ$-exchange coupling constant, as the only unknown parameter. The coupling constants for the vector $ρ$- and $ω$-exchanges are determined by the pole positions of the well established states $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. We demonstrate that these parameter sets also successfully describe the $T_{cs0}(2870)$ without further tuning. For the three-body system, our results indicate that an $I\\left(J^P\\right)=1 / 2\\left(0^{-}\\right)$ three-body molecular bound state exists when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state located within approximately $-10~\\text{MeV}$ of the $D\\bar{D}^*$ threshold. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the complex energy plane using the complex scaling method to search for molecular resonances, though no evidence of resonances is found in considered channels. We also apply this formalism to the bottom analog $BB^*K^*$ system. In this sector, the conditions for the existence of a three-body bound state are more relaxed, as a $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state located within $-25~\\text{MeV}$ below the threshold suffices, although three-body molecular resonances remain absent. We suggest that future experiments precisely measure the pole position of $Z_c(3900)$ or search for the three-body bound state in $DD\\bar{K}ππ$ and $DD\\bar{K}$ channels, as these efforts would mutually illuminate the nature of the associated states."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "In large-scale data processing scenarios, data often arrive in sequential streams generated by complex systems that exhibit drifting distributions and time-varying system parameters. This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications."

Our analysis combines X-ray data from the XMM-XXL survey with shear measurements from the three-year shape catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. The analysis focuses on the XXL C1 sample, comprising 171 clusters for abundance modeling, a subset of 86 clusters located within the XXL-N region for lensing-based mass calibration, and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature and luminosity measurements used to constrain scaling relations. Using the density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) algorithm, we construct a forward model with 12 parameters that incorporates the XXL selection function and cluster population modeling and accounts for key systematic effects including cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias. Our SBI analysis yields a constraint on the cosmological parameter $S_8 \\equiv σ_8 (Ω_{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \\pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity. The result is consistent with Planck and recent cluster-based measurements. The inferred temperature-mass relation is consistent with self-similar expectations within uncertainties, whereas the luminosity-temperature relation exhibits a slope steeper than the self-similar prediction. From the resulting posterior distribution of the forward model, we derive lensing-calibrated mass estimates for all individual XXL clusters with measured X-ray temperatures or luminosities. These results provide a self-consistent mass calibration for future multi-probe cosmological analyses of the XXL sample."

Multiple magnetic phases are identified, including a non-collinear Y phase in zero field, a field-induced collinear m = 1/3 magnetization plateau, and a high-field V phase. In the Y phase, the magnetic excitation spectrum exhibits both single-magnon excitations and an extended high-energy continuum. Both features are well described by non-linear spin wave theory. In the field-induced phases, complex effects of the spectrum renormalization even for large S = 5/2 material are clearly detectable.

The obtained error estimators are used to conduct refinements of the computational mesh and as a stopping criterion for the dynamic iteration. In particular, we allow for an adaptive and flexible discretization of the time domain, where variables can be discretized differently to match both goal and solution requirements, e.g. in view of multiple time scales. We endow the scheme with efficient solvers from numerical linear algebra to ensure its applicability to complex problems. Numerical experiments compare the adaptive approach to a uniform refinement."

The theoretically obtained $T_m$ quantitatively captures the measured solid-liquid phase transition boundaries across all probed ranges, validating the bubble-crystal interpretation and establishing defect--mediated melting as a predictive framework for strongly interacting electronic solids. This agreement further supports using bulk transport to probe the energetics of topological defects and screening in quantum Hall physics, and the approach is readily extendable to other electronic crystals, including the generalized Wigner crystal in moiré Chern bands."

To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM-Net consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in fine-grained long-range retrieval tasks and achieves competitive performance in standard language modeling and zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks, validating its superior capability to capture complex dependencies with significantly reduced computational overhead."

In this work, we model composite DNA storage as a multinomial channel and draw an analogy to digital modulation by representing composite letters on the three-dimensional probability simplex. To mitigate errors caused by sampling randomness, we derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point and employ practical channel codes for error correction. We then extend this framework to substitution and insertion-deletion (ID) channels, proposing constellation update rules that account for these additional impairments. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable performance with existing LDPC codes, compared to the prior schemes designed for limited-magnitude probability errors, whose performance degrades significantly under sampling randomness."

We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,Ω_{\\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0<-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\\&SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1<q_0\\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\\to\\infty)=w_0+w_a<-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\\&SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $Λ$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations."

We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique."

We examine two objective functions: the highest individual performance and total performance. For both objectives, the optimal contest is in a winner-take-all format. For the highest individual performance, the optimal shortlist size is exactly two contestants, but, in contrast, for total performance, the shortlist size does not affect the outcome, i.e., any size yields the same total performance. Furthermore, we compare the highest individual performance achieved with and without shortlisting, and show that the former is 4/3 times greater than the latter."

It treats audio as an active reasoning component, enabling sustained audio engagement and perception-grounded analysis. To instantiate it, we introduce a two-stage training framework, first teaching LALMs to localize salient audio segments through supervised fine-tuning, and then incentivizing proficient re-listening via reinforcement learning. In parallel, a structured data generation pipeline is developed to produce high-quality training data. Consequently, we present Echo, a LALM capable of dynamically re-listening to audio in demand during reasoning. On audio comprehension benchmarks, Echo achieves overall superiority in both challenging expert-level and general-purpose tasks. Comprehensive analysis further confirms the efficiency and generalizability of audio-interleaved reasoning, establishing it as a promising direction for advancing audio comprehension.

We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning the law of linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with additive Gaussian forcing from spatiotemporal observations. Most existing deep learning approaches either assume access to the driving noise or initial condition, or rely on deterministic surrogate models that fail to capture intrinsic stochasticity. We propose a structured latent-variable formulation that requires only observations of solution realizations and learns the underlying randomly forced dynamics. Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics. The latent dynamics and stochastic forcing are jointly inferred through variational learning, allowing recovery of stochastic structure without explicit observation or simulation of noise during training. Empirical evaluation on synthetic data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance under comparable modeling assumptions across bounded and unbounded one-dimensional spatial domains."

    "abstract": "We give the first two algorithms to enumerate all binary words of $\\{0,1\\}^\\ell$ (like Gray codes) while ensuring that the delay and the auxiliary space is independent from $\\ell$, i.e., constant time for each word, and constant memory in addition to the $\\ell$ bits storing the current word. Our algorithms are given in two new computational models: tape machines and deque machines. We also study more restricted models, queue machines and stack machines, and show that they cannot enumerate all binary words with constant auxiliary space, even with unrestricted delay. A tape machine is a Turing machine that stores the current binary word on a single working tape of length $\\ell$. The machine has a single head and must edit its tape to reach all possible words of $\\{0,1\\}^{\\ell}$ , and output them (in unit time, by entering special output states), with no duplicates. We construct a tape machine that achieves this task with constant delay between consecutive outputs, which implies that the machine implements a so-called skew-tolerant quasi-Gray code. We then construct a more involved tape machine that implements a Gray code. A deque machine stores the current binary word on a double-ended queue of length $\\ell$, and stores a constant-size internal state. It works as a tape machine, except that it modifies the content of the deque by performing push and pop operations on the endpoints. We construct deque machines that enumerate all words of $\\{0,1\\}^\\ell$ with constant-delay. The main technical challenge in this model is to correctly detect when enumeration has finished. Our work on deque machine is also motivated by other contexts in which endpoint modifications occur naturally. In particular, our result is a first step towards enumerating walks in directed graphs with constant delay and constant auxiliary space, addressing a core task in modern graph database query processing."

To address this issue, we propose D-NSS, a decentralized algorithm with node-specific sampling, and establish its sample complexity depending on the arithmetic mean of local standard deviations, achieving tighter bounds than existing methods that rely on the worst-case or quadratic mean. We further derive a matching sample complexity lower bound under heterogeneous variance, thereby proving the optimality of this dependence. Moreover, we extend the framework with a variance reduction technique and develop D-NSS-VR, which under the mean-squared smoothness assumption attains an improved sample complexity bound while preserving the arithmetic-mean dependence. Finally, numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows."

Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality. To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework."

We implement a realistic star formation history with time and position-dependent metallicity, and account for the effect of supernova kicks on present-day positions. We consider all binaries that have a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole primary in the present-day. We predict that the summed GW signal from all Galactic binaries will already be detectable 3 months into the LISA mission, by measuring the power spectrum of the total GW strain. We provide a simple publicly available code to calculate such a power spectrum from a user-defined binary population. In the full 4 year baseline mission lifetime, we conservatively predict that $>2000$ binaries could be individually detectable as GW sources. We vary the assumed common envelope (CE) efficiency $α$, and find that it influences both the shape of the power spectrum and the relative number of detectable systems with WD and NS progenitors. In particular, the ratio of individually detectable binaries with chirp mass $\\mathcal{M} < M_\\odot$ to those with $\\mathcal{M} \\geqslant M_\\odot$ increases with $α$. We therefore conclude that LISA may be able to diagnose the CE efficiency, which is currently poorly constrained."

While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints."

Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects."

We use the DisPerSE to identify filamentary structures at $z=4$, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments. For a fixed stellar-mass cut of $M_* \\geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$, the fraction of SMGs in the inner cluster-halo environment declines from $\\sim30\\%$ at $z=4$ to $\\sim3\\%$ by $z=1$, and similar trends are observed in other environments. The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} > 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\\%$ in low-density regions."

Here, envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a central fairness notion and resolving its existence is regarded as one of the most important open problems in this area of research. Two prominent relaxations of EFX are envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) and epistemic EFX (EEFX). While allocations satisfying each of these notions individually are known to exist even for general monotone valuations, whether both can be satisfied simultaneously remains open for all instances in which the EFX problem is itself unresolved. In this work, we show that there always exists an allocation that is both EF1 (in fact, the stronger notion EFL) and EEFX for additive valuations, thereby resolving the primary open question raised by Akrami and Rathi (2025) and bringing us one step closer to resolving the elusive EFX problem. We introduce a new share-based fairness notion, termed strong EEFX share, which may be of independent interest and which implies EEFX feasibility of bundles. We show that this notion is compatible with EF1, leading to the desired existence result."

This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS."

This method addresses a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) incorporating both travel time and comfort, then a feasible solution is chosen from the optimal solution set according to passenger preferences. Various experiment and simulation results are provided to validates the effectiveness of the controller, speed planning and the integrated design of both. Compared with traveling at a constant speed, the proposed speed planning method decreases the RMS value of body vertical acceleration by 17.3% while concurrently achieving shorter travel time."

    "abstract": "To integrate digital humans into everyday life, there is a strong demand for generating high-quality, fine-grained disentangled 3D avatars that support expressive animation and simulation capabilities, ideally from low-cost textual inputs. Although text-driven 3D avatar generation has made significant progress by leveraging 2D generative priors, existing methods still struggle to fulfill all these requirements simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose DreamBarbie, a novel text-driven framework for generating animatable 3D avatars with separable shoes, accessories, and simulation-ready garments, truly capturing the iconic “Barbie doll” aesthetic. The core of our framework lies in an expressive 3D representation combined with appropriate modeling constraints. Unlike prior methods, we use G-Shell to uniformly model watertight components (e.g., bodies, shoes) and non-watertight garments. By reformulating boundaries as Euclidean field intersections instead of manifold geodesics, we propose an SDF-based initialization and a hole regularization loss that together achieve a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> speedup and stable open topology without image input. These disentangled 3D representations are then optimized by specialized expert diffusion models tailored to each domain, ensuring high-fidelity outputs. To mitigate geometric artifacts and texture conflicts when combining different expert models, we further propose several effective geometric losses and strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamBarbie outperforms existing methods in both dressed human and outfit generation. Our framework further enables diverse applications, including apparel combination, editing, expressive animation, and physical simulation."

    "abstract": "Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks are employed to identify websites that utilize Tor encryption. Although State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) WF attacks demonstrate strong performance in single-tab scenarios, they face challenges in multi-tab scenarios. Many multi-tab WF attacks rely solely on direction sequence or process directional and temporal sequence separately. They ignore the coupling between directional and temporal features, which reflects distinct resource-loading processes for different websites. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes a new multi-tab WF attack, STMWF. It leverages spatial-temporal sequence analysis and jointly models Inter Arrival Time (IAT) with the direction sequence. STMWF utilizes an SE-attention-based feature extractor to derive features from various website resources within the spatial-temporal sequence. It then employs correlation self-attention to integrate these resource features into their respective websites, ultimately constructing distinct fingerprints for each site. Additionally, the method incorporates correlation denoising to suppress noise in the website fingerprints, thereby enhancing the discriminability of the extracted features. We collected single-tab traces to synthesize a dataset with controlled overlap ratios. We also captured real-world multi-tab traffic with varying tab-opening intervals, evaluating performance under authentic conditions. The experimental results indicate that STMWF significantly outperforms the SOTA multi-tab attacks in both dynamic and static settings. Specifically, it achieves an average F1-score improvement of approximately 14.87% under static conditions and 34.81% under dynamic conditions compared to the SOTA multi-tab WF attack, ARES. Furthermore, STMWF exhibits greater robustness against WF defenses than SOTA attacks and consistently surpasses them across varying overlapping scenarios."

    "abstract": "Rendering dynamic reverberation in a complicated acoustic space for moving sources and listeners is challenging but crucial for enhancing user immersion in extended-reality (XR) applications. Capturing spatially varying room impulse responses (RIRs) is costly and often impractical. Moreover, dynamic convolution with measured RIRs is computationally expensive with high memory demands, typically not available on wearable computing devices. Grouped Feedback Delay Networks (GFDNs), on the other hand, allow efficient rendering of coupled room acoustics. However, its parameters need to be tuned to match the reverberation profile of a coupled space. In this work, we propose the concept of Differentiable GFDNs (DiffGFDNs), which have tunable parameters that are optimised to match the late reverberation profile of a set of RIRs captured from a space that exhibits multi-slope decay. Once trained on a finite set of measurements, the DiffGFDN interpolates to unmeasured locations in the space. We propose a parallel processing pipeline that has multiple DiffGFDNs with frequency-independent parameters processing each octave band. The parameters of the DiffGFDN can be updated rapidly during inferencing as sources and listeners move. We evaluate the proposed architecture against the Common Slopes (CS) model on a dataset of RIRs for three coupled rooms. The proposed architecture generates multi-slope late reverberation with low memory and computational requirements, achieving a better energy decay relief (EDR) error and slightly worse octave-band energy decay curve (EDC) errors compared to the CS model. Furthermore, DiffGFDN requires an order of magnitude fewer floating-point operations per sample than the CS renderer."

Spread-spectrum frequency modulation (SSFM) theoretically provides high EMI attenuation but also introduces design challenges for WPT systems. This article presents an innovative transmitter and receiver circuit architecture to meet the stringent requirements of high modulation rates and broadband variations in WPT systems using SSFM. Unlike conventional fixed-frequency WPT systems, our design features a variable frequency WPT system comprising a class D inverter driving the transmitter coil and a nonlinear resonant circuit receiver. SSFM is achieved by modulating the inverter frequency with a triangular wave from 19 to 21 kHz. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves approximately 15 dB attenuation in both near-field radiation from the coils and dc conducted emission from the power lines compared to fixed-frequency operation at 20 kHz, validating the effectiveness of the theoretical, simulation, and experimental approaches. In addition, our broadband IPT system is simple, requiring no active feedback control or frequency tuning, making it highly practical."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is an important technique for extracting information about changes to the surface from bi-temporal remote sensing images. However, existing RSCD datasets are primarily based on satellite images, and those built from high-resolution UAV images are scarce. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-resolution, UAV-based change detection dataset (UAV-CD). In addition, UAV change detections differ significantly from satellite change detections. UAV images have higher spatial resolution and richer detailed information, but they are susceptible to interference from non-surface structural factors, such as shadows, illumination fluctuations, and vehicles. In contrast, satellite images provide wide coverage but lack sufficient detailed representation. Furthermore, most existing methods are specifically designed for satellite image characteristics, making them difficult to adapt to the high-detail and high-noise scenarios of UAV images. To overcome these challenges, we propose SFCF-Net. This introduces a Single-scale Global Feature Enhancement Module (SGFEM) to capture global contextual information from a single-scale perspective. The Multi-scale Dynamic Feature Integration Module (MDFIM) dynamically integrates semantic and structural information at different scales to effectively mitigate the problem of semantic inconsistency in single-scale features. The Multi-receptive Field Local Feature Fusion Module (MFLFM) aggregates local detail information through multi-scale convolutions to compensate for the lack of edge detail perception in global modelling. Experimental results on the UAV-CD, LEVIR-CD and CDD datasets demonstrate that SFCF-Net outperforms other baseline change detection networks, achieving detection accuracies of 92.73%, 92.95% and 90.84% respectively.

Purely manual teleoperation is prone to operator fatigue and error, while fully autonomous systems often lack the robustness and adaptability to handle. Here, we propose a human–machine shared cascade control method for magnetically driven microrobots, which effectively integrates human cognitive intelligence with machine autonomy for collision-free navigation in dynamic environments. The outer-loop hybrid shared control unit smoothly modulates control authority in response to real-time collision risk, dynamically integrating the operator instructions and the autonomous navigation system output guided by the enhanced artificial potential field method to formulate the guidance law. For the inner-loop motion tracking, a data-driven adaptive orientation controller is designed, which integrates a nonlinear feedforward compensator leveraging a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a linear feedback controller whose parameters are optimized using the virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) method, ensuring fast and precise tracking of the desired motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated through both simulation and physical experiments. In human-subject studies conducted on a physical magnetic actuation platform featuring both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios, quantitative results demonstrate that the shared control strategy significantly outperforms both purely manual and fully autonomous modes across all key metrics, including success rate, task completion time, stability, and safety (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p \\lt 0.001$</tex-math> </inline-formula>).

A validated instrument—derived from a previously developed questionnaire measuring seven operational dimensions of collaboration—was applied to evaluate group performance. The study involved 251 students from various engineering courses, organized into experimental groups based on personality traits and a control group formed according to student preference. Findings reveal that personality-based group formation influences collaborative performance, with outcomes varying by group configuration. Homogeneous and mixed groups emphasizing emotional stability (Neuroticism – N) demonstrated higher levels of leadership and collaboration, while heterogeneous groups underperformed compared to the control group. Across all formations, conflict management consistently emerged as the most challenging process, underscoring the importance of targeted strategies for managing interpersonal tensions in team-based learning. From a methodological standpoint, the assessment instrument exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α > 0.9), affirming its reliability for evaluating collaborative dynamics in academic contexts. The study concludes that personality-informed group formation can optimize specific collaborative processes, though its effectiveness depends on the combination of personality traits within each team. These findings hold significant implications for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly in informing the design of educational technologies that enable adaptive group formation and provide real-time feedback in collaborative learning environments."

    "abstract": "Precision medicine requires cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation technologies to achieve high accuracy levels suitable for healthcare monitoring. Recent advances, notably in personalized BP estimation methods utilizing transfer learning, have partially met these requirements. However, traditional personalized fine-tuning pipelines often ignore key physiological factors across age groups, thus limiting their effectiveness. This study identifies an important fine-tuning principle: target subjects benefit most when fine-tuned using a source model pretrained on an age-matched group. We introduce a novel two-level ensemble learning method, ATTE, which integrates multiple BP models for cuffless BP estimation based on pulse waves. It first performs feature-level ensemble learning (FEL) to combine age-group-specific fine-tuned models and enrich representations, then applies an optimized Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method that adaptively weights model outputs to boost accuracy and reduce model-selection uncertainty. Using only 50 transfer samples, ATTE improved systolic and diastolic BP estimation accuracy by 6.55% and 5.58% on a public dataset, compared to the traditional fine-tuning paradigm. It also achieved improvements of 5.10% and 8.30% on a self-collected dataset, which has been preliminarily validated in an elderly care scenario. Ablation and interpretability analyses validated the age-matched fine-tuning principle, the effectiveness of ATTE, and its model-agnostic generalizability. This work represents a pioneering step in optimizing personalized BP estimation and underscores its significant potential for real-world healthcare applications."

While recent deep sequence models have shown strong predictive capabilities, they often fail to explicitly capture the intrinsic dependencies that govern the conditions and impacts of event occurrences in business processes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Place-Transition Embedding (PTE) framework that captures these dependencies through Petri-net–inspired token consumption and generation semantics. PTE employs a deep embedding network to simulate the evolution of markings, i.e., how each observed event drives token dynamics over places over time under our resource interpretation. In addition, we introduce a temporal scoring mechanism that ranks candidate activities by jointly considering resource feasibility and temporal urgency, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that PTE achieves state-of-the-art performance for next-activity prediction. Moreover, PTE generalizes robustly under sparse training conditions, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world scenarios with limited business data."

The framework is evaluated across three representative topologies—Free, Covered, and Underground—providing a structured understanding of environment-conditioned reliability in LoRaWAN networks.

    "abstract": "Information security and privacy are critical for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based low-altitude networks. To enhance the security of the UAV transmitter, this paper inves tigates the jammer-assisted UAV covert communication systems with imperfect CSI, where part of friendly jammers is selected to send artificial noise (AN) to confuse the warden. Then, the UAV transmitter can hide the transmitted signals into “noise”, decreasing warden's detection probability for the transmission behavior. It is important to jointly optimize the jammer selection and jamming power, as AN sent by friendly jammers will interfere with the warden and receiver, simultaneously. However, existing channel-aware schemes work with a perfect channel state information (CSI) of the transmitter-to-receiver (i.e., covert link) and jammer-to-receiver links, which is impractical in low-altitude networks. Therefore, this paper concerns the imperfect CSI of the covert link and the channel distribution information (CDI) of the UAV transmitter-to-warden link and jamming links from the jammers to the warden and receiver. First, given the imperfect CSI, the warden's average detection error probability (WADEP) is analyzed. Then, given that WADEP is higher than the covert ness constraint, the covert throughput is analytically derived and maximized by jointly optimizing the jammer selection, jamming power, and transmission rate (J-JamSPR-ImCSI). Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, a two-step Jensen's inequality based algorithm is proposed to provide a heuristic solution (2 Step-JIHA). The main idea is to first jointly optimize jammer selection and jamming power with the covertness constraint to minimize the average received AN power at the receiver (which negatively impacts the covert throughput), then a bisection method can be employed to obtain the optimal transmission rate maximizing the covert throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed 2-Step-JIHA can provide a near optimal covert throughput with a lower complexity. Moreover, when the CSI is imperfect, compared to the existing channel-aware scheme, the proposed J-JamSPR-ImCSI with 2-Step-JIHA can improve the covert throughput by 54.26%, when the covertness constraint is 0.9."

Swin Transformer hierarchical attention methods are used in this design. A 224x224 Gaussian-filtered EyePACS dataset is used to train the model; this strategy clarifies the lesion and ensures the transformer framework receives input with the exact resolution. There are five DR severity levels: nil, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative. Complex preprocessing methods, including contrast normalization and attention-based filtering, ensure accurate classification for all five DR severity levels in STBDR-Net. STBDR-Net outperforms CNNs and baseline transformer models in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and weighted metrics. This is true when comparing the two methods. Mild and moderate DR might confuse automated systems. The model distinguishes mild and moderate DR well. STBDR-Net is a trustworthy and useful real-world DR screening tool.

Furthermore, we design a contrastive learning-based ranking-aware performance predictor that enables accurate architecture ranking under limited supervision.

The data were analyzed using SmartPLS with SEM to examine the hypothesized relationships. The results showed that all the content attributes had significant and positive effects on TRU, which itself had a positive impact on CPI. Among these attributes, VRI was found to be the most influential, highlighting the value of attractive and high-quality visuals in building trust and encouraging purchases. Practically, the findings suggest that e-commerce businesses should focus on improving AI-driven content strategies that emphasize INF, PER, AUT, and appealing visuals, especially in fast-growing markets like Bangladesh. From a social perspective, the study reflects how consumers are increasingly accepting AI technologies, leading to more interactive and trustworthy online shopping experiences. Theoretically, this research contributes by applying AI content features within the S-O-R framework in a developing country context, offering new insights into how AI shapes consumer decisions. However, limitations such as the use of convenience sampling and a cross-sectional design are acknowledged, and future studies are recommended to use longitudinal approaches and more representative samples for better generalizability."

    "abstract": "Understanding complex scenes in real world environments often demands more than visual analysis alone it requires the integration of both visual and auditory cues. This study investigates whether prompt-based fusion using large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine modality specific outputs for zero-shot scene captioning. We propose a modular framework that leverages BLIP-2 for visual captioning, Whisper for audio transcription, and FLAN-T5 for prompt-driven fusion. To simulate multimodal caption pairs, we augment the COCO image caption dataset with text-to-speech (TTS) generated audio and incorporate filtered real-world audio-image samples. Unlike prior approaches requiring joint training or architectural modification, our pipeline operates entirely in zero-shot mode with no model retraining. Evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE-L, and cosine-based semantic similarity reveals that our fusion strategy, despite its simplicity, achieves semantically coherent captions across modalities. This work demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-guided fusion for assistive AI and offers a reproducible, low-resource solution for applications such as smart narration, AR/VR accessibility, and navigation aids for visually impaired users."

    "abstract": "Human lives, infrastructure, and economic prosperity are among the major risks that natural catastrophes pose to society, especially in the vulnerable regions where there is little to no early-warning system. To fulfill the demand for precise and explainable forecasting, this paper proposes an ensemble learning framework, called FusionNet+, that can combine various data to predict the intensity and the economic burden of a natural disaster. To model the architecture, the architecture can be arranged into three hierarchical layers, the Spatiotemporal Weather Data Response (STWDR) module, which characterizes climatic characteristics in convolutional and recurrent layers; Multi-Information Decision Prediction (MIDP) module, which integrates social and infrastructural indicators with contextual relevance; and Multi-modal Ensemble (MME) layer of combining outputs with optimum weighted fusion. The combination of these elements allows processing heterogeneous inputs such as weather data, disaster records and real-time social signals end-to-end. FusionNet+ has been tested on selected dataset based on EM-DAT and additional sources, and proved to be a better model in all measurement of predicting results. The model had an R 2 score of 0.914, a mean absolute error (MAE) decrease of 22 percent, and 92.6 percent of classification accuracy, which significantly outperforms traditional machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and baseline deep learning architectures (LSTM, CNN, Transformer). Moreover, explainable AI methods (SHAP and LIME) were used to gain transparency, which provides some piece of information regarding the role of each input modality as opposed to others."

    "abstract": "In Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), route discovery and maintenance are costly in terms of network overhead, which degrades performance, shortens network lifespan, and results in network partitioning. The extremely dynamic nature of node movement and topological changes requires the deployment of clever, adaptive routing schemes that can deliver data packets to their destinations efficiently. In such scenarios, route paths are often changed due to changes in link connectivity, resulting in reliability and stability of data transfer as a critical problem. This research deals with these problems by utilizing DRL-MANET — a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Routing protocol that combines route stability metrics and security-aware decision-making. DRL-MANET applies deep Q-learning to dynamically acquire the best routing routes according to the current network state, residual energy level, trust values, and link quality, and integrates anomaly detection to prevent malicious nodes. The main goal of this paper is to design and compare a DRL-based routing approach to improve route stability, packet delivery ratio, delay reduction, and security in MANET networks. The suggested framework is able to prove its worth in reaching effective, secure, and adaptive routing, providing a smooth solution for large and dynamic MANET deployments."

We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art CNN architectures—DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, and XceptionNet—alongside a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32). Experiments on the AVLips dataset (3,396 real and 4,206 fake videos) show that ViT-B/32 achieves superior performance, with 96% F1-score, and 99% AUC. Audio-visual fusion consistently outperforms visual-only models, highlighting the strength of multimodal analysis. To enhance transparency, LIME-based explainable AI visualizations are employed to interpret model predictions. Unlike previous works that primarily rely on unimodal cues, our approach uniquely integrates audio waveforms with visual frames to expose subtle inconsistencies in lip synchronization. Given the potential misuse of deepfakes in misinformation, fraud, and political manipulation, this study emphasizes the urgent need for robust and interpretable detection methods. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of transformer-based models with XAI for dependable deepfake detection, with future work focusing on temporal modeling and scalability."

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to derive important spatial and structural features of the heart ultrasound scan. To overcome weaknesses associated with small data reduction in annotation, the system inserts self-supervised learning to enhance efficiency and generalizing learning. The additional expression of features using texture-based descriptors, e.g., the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) helps describe textural information contained within details. The specified integrated framework is created to guide clinicians in reaching immediate and informed decisions with the scope of stipulating early-stage identification and striving to influence positive outcomes of cardiac care."

At this frequency, the intersubband transitions are supported by a well width of about 156 Å, which is equivalent to a 24-layer MoS2 quantum well. The MoS2/Zn1-xMgxO material system exhibits type-II band alignment, which promotes charge separation, while the structural asymmetry breaks wave function parity and enables transverse electric (TE) polarized intersubband transitions. These transitions are generally forbidden in symmetric quantum wells due to optical selection rules. The optical properties and energy levels are computed using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) for numerical and analytical verification. The proposed 156 Ǻ MoS2 well structure shows a peak responsivity of 2.04 A/W and a specific detectivity of at 77 K. The findings confirm that the proposed asymmetric structure and material system synergistically enhance optical absorption and confinement THz frequency regime.The originality of this work lies in the detector’s sensitivity to sub-nanometer changes in well width, enabling wavelength-selective operation. This tunability offers a strong potential for integration into terahertz Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems. The results support the application of 2D material-based Asymmetric Quantum Well (AQW) structures in narrowband THz photodetectors for upcoming communication and sensing technologies."

Conventional episodic tests are unable to reflect changes in behavior in the moment-to-moment situation. In response to this, a continuous mental health monitoring system based on the use of IoT is offered, which includes multimodal sensors to monitor HRV, electrodermal activity, sleep patterns, physical activity, and speech behavior. The personalized anomaly detection is implemented using a Temporal Convolutional Autoencoder (TCAE), which retrieves a compressed behavioral state vector from time-series sensor data. The system provided an anomaly detection accuracy of 94.2%, precision of 91.7%, and recall of 93.5%, a success rate of 99.2 % of alert deliveries, and average latency of less than 1.2 seconds. The proposed model outperformed settlement systems in terms of real-time responsiveness, privacy encryption, and user satisfaction compared to earlier schemes.

Approximately 85% are responsible for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from all cases. The 5-year survival rate is only 12–16%, despite major advances in medicinal drugs, surgical procedures, and diagnostic tests. Therefore, we were inspired to perform a comprehensive study to suggest more potential drug candidates for lung cancer. In our study, we employed various computational methods, like PASS prediction, drug-likeness properties prediction, molecular docking, ADMET properties analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and post simulation analysis. From the analysis of PASS, ADMET, and Lipinski’s rule of five, the molecules M3 and M4 have strong drug properties for cancer therapy. A better binding affinity (-9.3 kcal/mol) was found for M1, M3, and M4. A more stable energy gap was found than that of the standard. The molecular dynamic result is better than the standard. A more favorable binding free energy is found in the ligands M3 (Aloin A) and M4 (Aloin B). From our findings, we may suggest that the molecules M3 (Aloin A) and M4 (Aloin B) have more potency than the control Gefitinib (D1) as a lung cancer inhibitor. These two compounds should be further validated by in vitro and in vivo studies."

Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, we evaluate classifiers including Random Forest, LightGBM, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Autoencoders, and Deep Neural Networks. A voting-based ensemble strategy is implemented to improve robustness and generalization across diverse attack types. The ensemble model achieves a peak accuracy of 89%, with notable performance in detecting low-frequency and stealthy threats. To promote model interpretability, LIME and SHAP are applied for post hoc explanation, enabling clear visualization of feature contributions at both local and global levels. A web-based interface is also developed, offering real-time monitoring, alert generation, and analytics for security analysts. This study demonstrates that combining high-performing machine learning models with XAI techniques can significantly improve the adaptability, interpretability, and operational effectiveness of modern IDS frameworks."

    "abstract": "In financial systems, credit risk refers to the possibility that a debtor would fail to fulfill their agreed-upon commitments. Credit issuance is a core function of modern banks and involves assessing various criteria. However, repayment issues offer considerable risks to banks, hence comprehensive risk management is required. Because of the close relationship between credit risk and prospective investment returns, institutions that practice good risk control undertake comprehensive evaluations. In order to predict credit risk using various datasets, this research investigates the function of data preparation. An approach to enhance prediction performance is suggested, which involves combining a stacked classifier method with a filter-based feature selection methodology. This method combines the predictions of two different models, RF and SVM, and then uses a Bayesian average to combine the two. Results from a comparison of RF, SVM, and their ensemble reveal that the suggested SVM-RF model outperforms the others. Banks will be able to better identify high-risk borrowers and increase financial stability thanks to the results, which show that ensemble learning and feature selection, can greatly improve credit risk assessment with a prediction rate of 94.53%."

    "abstract": "To meet the growing demands of food and, conversely, due to the crisis of land resources in densely populated countries, aquaponics (i.e., combining aquafarming and hydroponics together) can be an effective solution. In addition, if poultry farming is integrated with that of aquaponics in a multi-layer system, then it can be considered a promising sustainable solution with the context to solve the limited land resources. Additionally, in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) the Internet of Things (IoT) has proven to be a very effective technology for precision agriculture. Currently, very little research has considered the poultry integrated aquaponics system. Even though few studies have been found in the literature addressing the systems individually, they lack in integrating all three systems (i.e., aquaponics, poultry, and plants) together. Moreover, use of IoT for such systems has been practiced rarely. Therefore, in this research, we have designed and developed a poultry integrated multi-layer aquaponics system. The structure of the system includes a bottom layer for fish farming, a middle layer for poultry farming, and an upper layer for plant cultivation. In this system, bi-products of one layer can be used as pesticides and herbicides at the other layers. Finally, the experimental results have shown satisfactory and acceptable output suitable for water level maintenance, pH level control, turbidity monitoring, temperature control, humidity measurement, and moisture level monitoring for plants, poultry, and fish farming through the proposed aquaponics system. Following three days of testing with two-hour sampling intervals, the prototype demonstrated the viability of fish, plant, and poultry interaction, pH control, and water recirculation. The study provides a feasible IoT foundation for integrated smart farming, even though long-term stability and nutrient-cycle monitoring still require investigation."

Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that incorporates the privacy-preserving technique, allowing multiple parties to train AI models cooperatively without having to reveal the raw data. While FL offers several advantages due to decentralized training, it still faces some challenges like poisoning attacks, trust management and lack of accountability across clouds. Thus, this research provides an integrated framework combining Federated Learning and Blockchain technology for the first time rendering a stable, transparent, and AI infested trust management system among multi-cloud data transaction while countervailing all these impediments. The architecture proposes using the immutability and decentralized consensus of Blockchain to validate and record trust scores, model updates, as well as participant behavior in a federated network. Smart contracts are used to enforce fine-grained access control dynamically and incentivize data providers and cloud nodes to behave honestly. To train models across various data silos, we use Federated Learning and deploy an AI-driven trust engine that continuously assesses the credibility of nodes based on behavioral analytics as well as quality and historical performance of contribution. This framework guarantees data sovereignty, integrity and auditability while still preserving user privacy. Extensive simulations and empirical analysis show that the proposed system can effectively defend against adversarial threats (e. g., model poisoning, unauthorized access, data tampering). In addition, the federation system was significantly improved about integrity and performance under heterogeneous data and cloud environments with AI models integrated trust-aware functionality. The framework also enables dynamic trust reconfiguration based on emerging threats or policy changes, thereby ensuring long-term scalability and resilience. This research hence serves as a very strong model towards trustworthy multi-cloud ecosystems, closing the gap between secure AI collaboration and transparent data governance."

    "abstract": "The demand for efficient indoor logistics has driven interest in autonomous and semi-autonomous mobile robotic systems. These systems are useful for transporting items in structured spaces like offices, hospitals, and academic institutions. This paper presents LineCourier, a semi-autonomous mobile robot built for indoor file delivery. The system combines embedded control, line navigation, obstacle detection, and a web-based interface for task control and monitoring. It uses infrared (IR) sensors to follow a black line and an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in its path. An ESP32 microcontroller manages the robot’s functions. It reads sensor data and controls motion through an L298N motor driver. A MERN stack-based web application provides real-time monitoring. It shows the robot’s current position, route, and delivery status. Users can assign tasks and receive live feedback remotely. The system was tested through 300 delivery runs over five separate trials. Each run was assessed for line tracking, obstacle handling, and task completion. A run was considered failed if the robot left the line, did not complete the task, or needed manual help. The robot achieved an average success rate of 96.67%, showing stable and reliable performance. The architecture is modular, which allows easy expansion and future upgrades. The results prove that LineCourier is a reliable solution for indoor logistics and can support smart office automation and service robotics."

Conventional firefighting strategies often require direct human intervention in hazardous environments, exposing personnel to life-threatening conditions and limiting the efficiency of emergency responses. To address these challenges, this research presents an IoT-enabled hybrid robotic firefighting framework that integrates multi-sensor fire detection, rule-based autonomy, and dual suppression mechanisms for enhanced industrial safety. A sensor fusion scheme combining flame, smoke, temperature, and vision modalities enables reliable fire detection and localization, while finite-state behavioural logic governs autonomous navigation, suppression mode selection and operator override. Dual suppression agents—water and Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF)—provide adaptability across Class A and Class B fire scenarios. Experimental validation under controlled flame conditions demonstrated detection latencies of 1.1–2.3 s across distances up to 50 cm, suppression coverage of 0.11–0.15 m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, and real-time situational monitoring with 200–300 ms video latency. These results confirm the feasibility of low-cost, rule-based robotic firefighting solutions in constrained industrial environments.The originality of this study does not lie in the isolated use of commercially available components, but in their systematic integration into a coherent, application-oriented framework tailored to industrial safety in resource-limited regions. This study advances the field by providing a reproducible platform that balances affordability, operational robustness, and practical deployability, thereby bridging the gap between conceptual research and real-world industrial firefighting applications."

Using subsets of the SQuAD benchmark, classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, Bi-Lstm, and CNN were developed and evaluated. Ensemble techniques such as hard voting, soft voting, and stacking were employed.

A proposal of FairSurviveGAN (FSG) is introduced in this paper, which is a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network designed to generate censoring-aware and demographically balanced patient profiles for survival analysis. Using a large-scale racially stratified dataset of 28,800 A-HCT patients, FSG exploits high-level interactions between clinical measures, survival durations, and censoring variables, hence allowing model training across the underserved races to be more equitable. By integrating stratified concordance optimization, FSG reduces subgroup performance discrepancies while achieving superior predictive accuracy (96.87%) and ROC-AUC (0.9622), outperforming conventional machine learning and deep learning thresholds. Furthermore, improvements in fairness were confirmed through stratified C-index and Brier scores, while clinical interpretability was ensured using SHAP and permutation-based feature importance. These findings emphasize the potential of fairness-aware generative modeling to enhance survival prediction, lessen racial bias, and advance equitable precision medicine."

    "abstract": "Designing an anthropomorphic robotic hand with few actuators while replicating the dexterous motion capabilities of the human hand remains a challenging problem. In this work, a kinematic synergy analysis method is proposed to identify joints with high motion independence and to quantify the synergistic motion characteristics of joints with strong motion dependence. Based on these findings, design principles for intra finger and inter-finger coupling–compliance mechanisms are developed, enabling the mechanical embodiment of joint kinematic synergies within and between fingers. Furthermore, a design principle for anthropomorphic robotic hands that reduces actuator count while retaining diverse motion functions is formulated. This principle is embodied in a 12-actuator, 21-joint prototype named SX-Hand, featuring a flexible thumb and an articulated palm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SX Hand achieves the maximum score in the Kapandji test, performs all 33 grasp types defined in the comprehensive GRASP taxonomy, and executes dexterous in-hand manipulations. The proposed approach provides an effective conceptual and technical route for reproducing rich motion functions with reduced actuation, offering valuable guidance for the development of efficient anthropomorphic robotic hands and other bionic systems."

    "abstract": "Deep unfolding networks (DUNs), which integrate the interpretability of traditional optimization solvers with the representation learning capabilities of deep neural networks, have shown remarkable potential in compressed sensing (CS). However, existing DUNs treat all image regions uniformly, ignoring structural variations and limiting reconstruction fidelity. Many also require heavy parameters and iterations, while still over-looking fine-grained features and inter-stage dependencies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Smoothed ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> Norm Unfolding Network (SL0-Net), a novel adaptive deep CS framework inspired by the traditional smoothed ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> norm optimization algorithm for sparse signal recovery. Specifically, we introduce the fractal dimension as a quantitative metric to precisely characterize the texture complexity of local regions. This design enables SL0-Net to adaptively allocate a significantly higher number of measurements to structurally intricate regions, while assigning fewer measurements to low-complexity regions. Secondly, to mitigate the issue of feature loss and enhance inter-stage information flow, we further design the SL0-inspired Measurement-Injected Cross-Attention (SMICA) module, which effectively captures inter-dependencies between feature maps from different unfolding stages and also explicitly incorporates physical CS measurements into the attention computation pipeline. This design facilitates robust information interaction between high-level abstract feature representations and low-level measurement signals, thereby substantially improving the reconstruction fidelity of fine-grained image details. Extensive experiments were conducted on widely used benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed network. The results demonstrate that the proposed SL0-Net outperforms existing methods in terms of image reconstruction quality, while maintaining a more favorable trade-off between performance and model complexity."

Our approach organizes sensor nodes via a max-heap structure and introduces a novel resultant vector-based metric to evaluate coverage potential; the key optimization parameter α for this metric was calibrated through theoretical derivation based on optimal hexagonal geometry. This method implicitly transforms the Unit Disk Cover (UDC for brief) problem into a Discrete Unit Disk Cover (DUDC for brief), achieving real-time performance and high-quality coverage with reduced redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reaches the best coverage quality compared to baseline methods while maintaining almost the same computational complexity."

    "abstract": "With the development of autonomous driving, understanding the behavior of traffic participants has become increasingly important. Vehicle trajectories contain rich information, however, they are often contaminated with noise in real-world environments. While existing trajectory processing methods may incorporate physical models to some extent, they typically struggle to enforce strict adherence to physical constraints. As a result, the processed trajectories may become distorted, making it difficult to accurately infer the driver’s control actions. In this paper, the vehicle kinematic model is embedded into a learnable neural network. By leveraging backpropagation through the physical model, the network can be trained without the need for explicit labels of driving actions. The design of intermediate network layers ensures that the output trajectories strictly satisfy physical constraints and enables robust inference of the driver’s inputs. Cross-dataset experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms direct computation approaches: errors in acceleration and deceleration estimation are reduced by approximately 84%, while steering action errors are reduced by approximately 43%. Real-world vehicle data further validate the trajectory reconstruction method, achieving a 5% reduction in prediction error when applied to fixed-point trajectory prediction models compared to unprocessed trajectories."

    "abstract": "In a key-value storage system, a small amount of hot item will account for most of the traffic. Skewed workloads can lead to load imbalance between servers, and some servers that keep hotspots will become system bottlenecks and impact the performance of the entire system. The recent studies have shown that the load imbalance can be eliminated by placing a small, fast cache node in front of the back-end servers, i.e., in-network cache. And the appearance of programmable switches made it possible to place this node on the switch, the place through which the traffic must pass. While existing in-network cache effectively balances loads between servers in large-scale storage systems, they struggle in write-intensive workloads and lose scalability with increasing client numbers due to imbalanced cache nodes. This paper introduces HarmonyCache, a scalable and high-performance in-network cache system that supports write-back methods. HarmonyCache use cache replication and read-write separation mode, only one node in all the cache is responsible for handling write requests, the other node can only handle read requests. To achieve system scalability and minimize cache coherence overhead, HarmonyCache proposes an adaptive cache replication scheme to decide where the cache should be replicated and how many replications should be made. Additionally, according to the requirements of different cache nodes, we design different types of in-network caches using different switch resources and propose a hybrid cache scheme. Our HarmonyCache prototype and extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in key-value store throughput across various access patterns (read/write intensive), achieving a throughput gain of up to 7.6× over state-of-the-art solutions under skewed write-intensive workloads."

This method builds upon the evaluation of crash scenarios by considering the sequential nature of crashes, incorporating crash progression and contributing factors. The results highlight the current challenge faced by manufacturers in designing systems that are safe yet perform in a manner expected by human drivers. The proportional reduction of crash patterns involving rear-end collisions during left or right turns suggests that actions were taken by manufacturers to address the aforementioned challenge. However, other crash patterns have shown a proportional increase in recent years, such as collisions with objects and on narrow roads, with specific variations by manufacturers. These findings provide key insights for shaping future AV development, guiding public sector decisions, and building public trust in automation."

    "abstract": "For full-size humanoid robots, reliable locomotion on complex terrains—such as long staircases—remains challenging, even with recent advances in reinforcement-learning-based control. In such settings, limited perception, ambiguous terrain cues, and insufficient adaptation of gait timing can cause even a single misplaced or mistimed step to result in rapid loss of balance. We introduce a perceptive locomotion framework that merges terrain sensing, gait regulation, and whole-body control into a single reinforcement learning policy. A downward-facing depth camera mounted under the base observes the support region around the feet, and a compact U-Net reconstructs a dense egocentric height map from each frame in real time, operating at the same frequency as the control loop. The perceptual height map, together with proprioceptive observations, is processed by a unified policy that produces joint commands and a global stepping-phase signal, allowing gait timing and whole-body posture to be adapted jointly to the commanded motion and local terrain geometry. We further adopt a single-stage successive teacher–student training scheme for efficient policy learning and knowledge transfer. Experiments conducted on a 31-DoF, 1.65 m humanoid robot demonstrate robust locomotion in both simulation and real-world settings, including forward and backward stair ascent and descent, as well as crossing a 46 cm gap.

    "abstract": "Diesel generators (DiGs) play a vital role in Micro grids (MG) to ensure resiliency and reliability; however, accurate modeling of their behavior in both grid-connected and islanded modes is challenging due to limited experimental and manufacturer data. Standard simulation models often fail to capture real world dynamics, leading to inaccurate results. To address these limitations, this paper presents an adaptive digital twin (DT) model for the 62.5kVA DiG unit at the Center for Microgrid Research (CMR). The DT model, capable of grid-connected and islanded operations, is developed and experimentally validated within the CMR's Microgrid infrastructure. The proposed DT leverages a novel adaptive parameter methodology to dynamically reflect the generator's behavior in varying operating conditions for both transient and steady-state responses. The results confirm that the adaptive DT accurately replicates the dynamic response of the real-world industry-grade DiG. The DT offers a robust modeling platform for advanced MG studies that involve DiGs under multiple operation modes."

    "abstract": "novel wideband antenna with five reconfigurable polarization states is presented for intelligent IoT applications, where polarization agility can be exploited by a higher-layer controller to enhance link reliability in dynamic multipath environments. To achieve wideband performance across all polarization states, coupling mechanisms are strategically introduced into the radiation structure, feeding structure, and feeding network simultaneously. Firstly, through equivalent circuit analysis, shorting pins, metal strips, and slots are integrated into the radiation structure. The coupling mechanisms excite first- and second-order frequency responses, resulting in significant gain improvement and overlapping bandwidth enhancement. Secondly, a co-planar capacitive feeding structure is implemented into the feeding network to improve impedance matching. Subsequently, weakly coupled transmission lines are deployed within both differential and full-polarization feeding networks. Such a configuration ensures wide overlapping bandwidth performance throughout all five polarization states by suppressing phase shift errors. Finally, by controlling the ON/OFF states of PIN diodes, the feeding network generates desired phase differences, enabling the proposed antenna to be reconfigured between five polarization states, i.e., linearly polarization (LP) with three orientations, left-hand circularly polarization (LHCP), and right-hand circularly polarization (RHCP). Experimental results demonstrate that the antenna achieves an operating bandwidth of 8–13 GHz (47.6%), with axial ratio (AR) < 3.0 dB and in-band gain fluctuation < 3.0 dB. Characterized by wide bandwidth, full-polarization agility, and standard fabrication, the design presents a viable solution for demanding multi-polarization applications in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios."

A novel dataset was built from satellite-extracted environmental characteristics and ground-truth yield information from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and NASA POWER. The local-level performance of ten regression models was compared, in which SGD regressor was the best performer(up to R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.978). A Federated Averaging (FedAvg) approach was used for decentralized learning with linear SGD regressors while preserving privacy of the data and improving generalization.

A novel method using a Multi-Granularity Graph Convolution Network (MG-GCN) model to classify depression degree from images of EEG signal is introduced in this work. The architecture consists of image processing techniques such as median filtering and enhancement using ESRGAN to improve the clarity of the signal. A Decision Tree classifier is used to classify depressive states into three levels of severity. Model performance is measured using structural similarity (SSIM), peak signal-to- noise ratio (PSNR), and classification accuracy, reflecting the ability of the model in the extraction and discrimination of functionally relevant brain activity patterns.MG-GCN architecture utilizes multi-level graph structures for preserving strong and weak brain connectivity features to facilitate longer learning of brain topologies. It is implemented with a user-friendly graphical interface in MATLAB, by which EEG images can be uploaded and received with real-time diagnostic results. In addition to real-time prediction, visualization was improved, and performance metrics to assist clinical assessment, quick documentation is also enabled by automatic reporting of the system.

    "abstract": "Adders are digital circuits used in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) architecture that carry out arithmetic operations, particularly addition, on binary values. They are employed in a wide range of devices, such as memory systems, digital signal processors, and microprocessors. Logic gates that accept two binary values as inputs and output a binary sum make up an adder. These days, designing low power VLSI circuits heavily relies on low power circuits. Adiabatic circuits explain reversible logic, or the reuse of the same, which results in power savings. Using the traditional approach, CMOS circuits are utilized to lower circuit power dissipation. A number of adiabatic techniques were developed to address the shortcomings of CMOS circuits. These techniques use charging and discharging to further reduce power dissipation. Efficient Charge Recovery Logic (ECRL) and Positive Feedback Adiabatic logic (PFAL) are the methods employed. Arithmetic operations, such as adder and multiplier, require full adders. In this paper, we will examine the designs of adiabatic logic and develop a new complete adder employing PFAL logic, followed by simulations. Consequently, the circuits' effectiveness is displayed and contrasted utilizing the nano meter technologies. By lowering the amount of circuit delay, the Carry Look a Ahead Adder— also referred to as FAST ADDER—also plays a significant role. Since delay is a significant factor in LOW POWER VLSI CIRCUITS, the power dissipation in the full adder is decreased by employing the adiabatic technique. When comparing ECRL and PFAL, the power dissipation is decreased in both, but PFAL is somewhat more lowered. Tanner EDA Tool simulates every circuit utilizing 22 nm Technology."

    "abstract": "With the integration of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in environmental monitoring, the growing requirement for large-scale monitoring becomes a critical challenge due to limited battery power and storage in sensor nodes. While WSNs with integrated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tend to be effective for prolonging network lifetime, their deployment in the lineof-sight proximity incorporates redundant energy usage and system latency. To address this, we propose a hybrid region-aware UAV-assisted (HR-UAV) data acquisition strategy that divides the network area into two regions— near region and far region, with respect to the sink node. The near region nodes incorporate direct transmission of the data to the sink nodes, while the far region utilizes a UAV that plans an optimized route according to the Greedy algorithm with variation and insertion strategies. It collects data from a subset of sensor nodes using compressive sensing to reduce the data load in the UAV. The sink node reconstructs the data with the help of a learned sparsifying basis from historical data. Simulation results show that HR-UAV achieves energy efficiency of 9.17% –19.886%, reduces error of 11.15%–0.003%, reduces path length by 10.28%–25.64% and lowers the latency by 7.54%–25%."

The proposed model integrates depthwise separable (DS) convolutions, squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention, and global average pooling (GAP) to achieve high accuracy with a compact architecture comprising only < 20K parameters and < 0.1MB model size. Unlike prior work, SignNet-Nano is explicitly designed with deployment efficiency as a primary goal, enabling real-time inference with minimal performance degradation while requiring significantly less energy, latency, computation, and memory usage than state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight edge models. We profile inference performance in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), inference latency, frames per second (FPS), and memory footprint on a diverse set of platforms, including three edge devices— Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier NX, and Raspberry Pi 4— as well as three high-performance systems— Apple Mac M3 (MPS backend), NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU, and an Intel Core i7 12th Gen CPU.

In this work, we systematically examine various approaches and current advancements related to melanoma detection, focusing on both traditional image analysis techniques with the integration of deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance detection accuracy. It highlights ongoing challenges in accurately diagnosing melanoma, particularly the difficulty in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions, and underlines the necessity of high-quality, diverse datasets for reliable assessments. The review explores established diagnostic approaches such as pattern analysis, rule-based systems (e.g., the ABCD rule), statistical feature extraction methods, as well as CNN-based models, all aimed at improving diagnostic precision. Additionally, integrating clinical information like patient history and demographic factors has shown potential to complement image-based assessment, further enhancing diagnostic performance. The findings emphasize the value of comprehensive diagnostic strategies—combining detailed image examination, relevant clinical data, and advanced deep learning techniques—in advancing melanoma detection and diagnosis. The paper also introduces a novel element by evaluating differences between expert dermatologists’ diagnostic performance and standard algorithmic or AI-based assessments via a custom-designed website. This comparative approach fosters a deeper understanding of prevailing diagnostic capabilities in melanoma detection.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a coarse alignment method using manifold optimization to solve the initial alignment problem of the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) on a rocking base. In this method, the initial coarse alignment of SINS is transformed from the constrained optimization problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained optimization problem in Manifold space. There are two innovations in this method: the first is the optimization method of gradient descent in Euclidean space, which is reviewed and extended to manifold space. By combining the trust region method with the Barzilai-Borwein method, the optimal selection of the iterative update step on the tangent space of the manifold is realized, which ensures the efficient and stable convergence of the algorithm. Secondly, the Cayley transform is used to construct the retraction mapping, and its closed form analytic solution and structure preservation characteristics are used to effectively suppress the error accumulation caused by numerical approximation, to ensure that the iterative points on the tangent space of the manifold are mapped to the manifold space. The experiment results indicate that the proposed coarse alignment method performs better than the existing methods."

    "abstract": "The advancement of deep learning models is far beyond the current computational demands and has even gone beyond the traditional hardware improvements predicted by Moore’s Law. While GPUs and AI accelerators like NVIDIA Tesla and Apple’s Neural Engine have better energy efficiency for deep neural networks (DNNs) there is still a disparity between hardware and software optimizations. Current optimization methods like pruning, quantization, and sparsification are static and are unable to adapt to dynamic workloads or heterogeneous architectures. This paper proposes an adaptive hardware-software co-design framework to bridge this gap, dynamically optimizing DNN configurations based on real-time hardware profiling, task complexity, and energy constraints. We benchmark diverse architectures (CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators) and models (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet) to evaluate performance and energy efficiency. Our results demonstrate that GPU tensor-core optimization reduces energy consumption by 48–120× compared to CPUs, while lightweight models like EfficientNet achieve 4–6× efficiency gains over complex architectures. Software optimizations, when hardware-aware, yield up to 96% energy reduction (e.g., pruning on AI accelerators). However, optimizations that are mismatches (e.g., sparsification on CPUs) can degrade performance. The proposed co-design framework achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs by enabling scalable and energy-efficient DNN deployment across edge devices."

    "abstract": "Global wheat production faces severe threats to its stability because Septoria along with stripe rust infections affect wheat leaves. Crop management depends heavily on quick and correct identification of these plant diseases. This paper develops a deep learning convention that employs an EfficientNetB3 architecture trained through finetuning to identify wheat leaf diseases. The open-source Kaggle platform serves as the dataset source with classes of healthy and both disease subclasses Septoria and stripe rust. Pre-processing and data augmentation methods received extensive use to enhance model ability to generalize. The researchers modified EfficientNetB3 by implementing dense layers together with batch normalization and dropout to both improve classification effectiveness and reduce overfitting risk. Standard evaluation performance metrics such as accuracy along with precision, recall and F1-score were used to assess the model during training and evaluation. The new method proved successful at detecting wheat leaf diseases by reaching high precision rates in disease classification. The proposed study advances automated disease diagnosis systems for agriculture, which promotes sustainable farming alongside responsible production and climate resilience and rural innovation as well as pandemic intervention to minimize crop losses and ultimately support better health and economic development in agricultural areas."

In order to help radiologists spot even the smallest anomalies, such as asymmetries, in ultrasound or mammography images, advanced computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems are becoming more and more crucial. This study proposes a novel multi-class classification framework for detecting and interpreting asymmetries using DenseNet, a potent deep neural network (CNN) has given 95% accuracy in medical imaging tasks. DenseNet is used to capture fine-grained tissue composition variations that are often missed by traditional CNNs and may indicate early pathological changes. As a result, DenseNet can take advantage of the hierarchical spatial features present in breast tissue."

To address this, we propose a Temporal Relational Graph Neural Network (TR-GNN) that represents drones as graph nodes with time-varying edges, enabling relation-wise interaction learning, neighbor awareness, and both self and surrounding state transition memory. TR-GNN supports role-based attention, failure-aware rerouting, anomaly detection, and energy-based retreat in a decentralized, data-driven manner. Deployed in a simulated Google Colab environment with dynamic trajectory visualization, metric monitoring, and adaptive role assignment, TR-GNN achieved 92.4% accuracy, 24.6 ms latency, and 19.3 mJ energy cost improvements of up to 9.9% and 35% over baselines demonstrating its strength as a real-time UAV coordination system, with future work aimed at neuromorphic chip deployment, heterogeneous fleet adaptation, and 3D airspace integration."

    "abstract": "The depth of field of optical lenses may be increased with the help of multi-focus image fusion, which takes many images of the same subject with varying degrees of focus and combines them into a single, focused image. With the fast evolution of image representation theories and methods like multi-scale geometric analysis, sparse representation, deep learning, etc., significant strides have been made in this area in recent years. Due to the limitations of incorrect image capture and the lack of clarity and quality of different settings, the demand for image fusion has risen dramatically in recent years. The first part of this study is a review of the many different approaches to multi-focus image fusion that have already been developed. Keeping current with the state of the art, taxonomy is provided to organize existing approaches into four primary classes: transform domain methods, spatial domain methods, hybrid methods that combine transform domain and spatial domain, and deep learning methods. Different fusion techniques are shown and reviewed for each classification. These image fusion techniques are practically used in visual sensor networks (VSN) for efficient surveillance and motion tracking. Then, using a multi-focus image dataset and well-known objective fusion criteria, a comparative analysis of the fusion algorithms is carried out. A few common objective assessment indicators are also discussed in depth, and both the subjective and objective evaluation criteria are provided. The future research directions and opportunities for multi-focus image fusion are covered in the last section of this paper."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, with delayed detection significantly impacting survival rates. While deep learning offers promise for early diagnosis, existing models face a critical trade-off between accuracy and speed, often failing to detect subtle malignancies or meet clinical workflow demands. This study presents Enhanced YOLOv11, an attention optimized architecture designed to bridge this gap through three key innovations: (1) a coordinate attention backbone that amplifies malignant features while suppressing tissue noise, (2) dynamic anchor tuning optimized for lesion morphology, and (3) a hybrid Wise-IoU + Focal Loss addressing class imbalance and ambiguous boundaries. Evaluated on 4,015 expert annotated mammograms (CBIS-DDSM), Enhanced YOLOv11 achieved 99.1% mean average precision (mAP) with 0.4 false positives per image excel radiologist performance in controlled trials. The model demonstrated exceptional sensitivity for early stage tumors (99.5%) and sub-5mm lesions (83% recall), while maintaining real-time inference speeds (58 FPS) through TensorRT optimization. These results represent a 1.9% mAP improvement over prior state-of-the-art models. By unifying clinical insight with architectural innovation, this work establishes a new paradigm for medical AI domain specific co design that delivers both diagnostic precision and practical deployability. The system’s performance and efficiency position it as a transformative tool for global breast cancer screening programs, with the potential to prevent thousands of missed diagnoses annually."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of video traffic in wireless networks, efficient transmission of high-quality video over wireless systems is increasingly challenging. The need for high data rates, low latency, and error resilience in video transmission calls for advanced compression techniques. Hence, this paper proposes Encoding-Error Aware Compression (EEAC) approach to address these challenges. The EEAC method combines Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance encoding and compression efficiency, reduce transmission errors, and maintain high reconstruction quality at the receiver. Using a standard foreman sequence for evaluation, the performance of the EEAC approach was compared with existing methods. The results demonstrate that EEAC outperforms the existing approaches in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER), Symbol Error Rate (SER), and compression efficiency. Specifically, EEAC achieved a 37% improvement in BER, a 22% improvement in SER, and a 40% improvement in compression efficiency, when compared with existing approaches. These findings showcase EEAC’s robustness in handling noisy environments and its suitability for high-demand wireless applications. The proposed approach is particularly beneficial for bandwidth-constrained 5G systems and offers a scalable solution for high-quality video transmission."

Breast cancer may be Highly treatable when detected in the initial stages. Tumors associated with breast cancer are of two types: malignant and benign. Malignant tumor pose a greater threat compared to benign tumors. Therefore, early identification of tumor type is important for providing the patient with appropriate treatment. Machine learning (ML) has become a significance tool in medical diagnostics. In this paper we use Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) to create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification model that differentiates between benign and malignant tumors is compared to give more accuracy the other classifiers. The SVM model achieves a 98.25 percentage accuracy rate, demonstrating its potential in predicting breast cancer. Additionally, we investigate strategies for hyperparameter tuning and feature selection for boosting the algorithm's capability. In order to tackle the challenges of interpretability in ML models, we employ Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The classification technique aims to identify breast cancer at an early stage."

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, video surveillance has become an essential means of ensuring security and safety in numerous domains. However, the detection of unusual and suspicious behaviors or movements in surveillance video still poses a significant problem due to the dynamically complex nature of human activity and context. Traditional methods excel at spatial feature extraction but lack temporal modeling, limiting their ability to detect suspicious activity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep-learning architecture called ConvGRU, combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). This approach builds on the fact that CNNs are inherently capable of extracting spatial features, while GRUs seek to capture temporal dependencies; hence, the proposed method is more general in a framework than using CNNs only for crime and suspicious activity detection. In experiments on multiple video surveillance datasets, the model achieves an increased accuracy of 99.52%, in particular it is effective in distinguishing among suspicious behaviors."

    "abstract": "One of the biggest threats to world food security is the impact of paddy leaf diseases including Blast, Bacterial Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Scald on rice production and quality. Using an explainable hybrid Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification model, optimization-driven feature selection, multi-level feature extraction, and hybrid preprocessing are all components of the new Paddy Leaf Disease Detection Framework that is proposed in this study. In order to improve the visibility of illness regions and decrease overfitting, the preprocessing pipeline integrates conventional and GAN-based data augmentation, edge detection, Gaussian smoothing, and domain-specific color space transformations. In order to capture both local and global illness patterns, attention processes are used to modify shape features, texture descriptors (GLCM, LBP), and multi-level CNN features. Optimization of classification efficiency is achieved by the use of the Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) method, which finds the most discriminative features. The effectiveness of the suggested architecture is proven by extensive tests conducted on the Rice Leaf Disease Dataset, PlantVillage Dataset, and Paddy Leaf Disease Dataset. It surpasses CNN (92.5% accuracy), ResNet50 (90.1% accuracy), VGG16 (88.4% accuracy), and SVM (85.7% accuracy) with its 95.3% accuracy, 94.2% precision, 96.1% recall, and 95.1% F1-score. The model's best SHAP-based interpretability score of 0.87 and quickest inference time of 0.03s attest to its viability for use in real-time scenarios. Robustness in varied contexts is highlighted by the low performance degradation indicated by cross-dataset generalization tests. This system provides a workable answer to the problem of paddy disease early detection and control by integrating computational economy, explainability, and high accuracy. Improved crop monitoring, less yield loss, and more sustainable rice farming practices on a worldwide scale can result from its incorporation into precision agricultural systems."

This paper proposes a multi-phase rule-based protein classification framework that hierarchically integrates biologically meaningful features. An early-exit decision strategy is employed. Feature extraction is performed across four progressive phases comprising chemical properties, hydropathy characteristics, behavioral sequence patterns through n-gram and six-letter exchange encoding, and functional attributes via normalized distance-based encoding. Family-specific knowledge matrices constructed exclusively from training data enable deterministic min–max rule evaluation at each phase for efficient candidate pruning and early termination. Experiments conducted on 8,555 human protein sequences spanning ten families achieve an average classification accuracy of 97.66%. 5-fold, 25-fold, and 45-fold cross-validation statistically confirm performance stability under class-imbalanced conditions. Further cross-species validation on zebrafish and mouse protein datasets yields accuracies of 96.11% and 94.89%, respectively, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse biological distributions.

    "abstract": "High quality InSAR measurements require precise and accurate range coregistration both between the reference and the secondary SAR images, and between the reference SAR image and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used for computing topographic phase. However, this requirement is not invariably satisfied due to the occurrence of range misregistrations. The range misregistration can occur between the reference image and the DEM, between the reference and secondary images, or due to the inhomogeneity within the range resolution cell. Our analysis reveals that, apart from the decorrelation effects, the effects of all three misregistration types ultimately reduce to that of an equivalent misregistration between the reference image and the DEM, which manifests as a phase error. Moreover, a closure phase error can be induced by the InSAR phase errors from the range misregistration between the reference and secondary images, as well as the inhomogeneity of the range resolution cell. We derive the InSAR and closure phase errors from both geometric and signal theory perspectives, assuming a homogeneously distributed target. We further extend the derivation to different types of targets. The derived InSAR and closure phase errors are confirmed by simulation and real-data experiments."

    "abstract": "Traditional device authentication techniques relying only on a single device for authentication are susceptible to poor performance due to insufficient channel observations. Although these challenges are mitigated by centralized collaborative authentication schemes, such schemes assume that all users desire to learn the same model. They further assume constant collaborator presence, leading to poorly trained models in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments with fleeting encounters. Moreover, they are vulnerable to GPS spoofing attack. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Gossip Learning (GL)-based collaborative Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) scheme, where collaborators assist vehicles in authenticating transmitters by distributively training their Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) models using the location and Channel State Information (CSI) of the transmitters. The collaborators also improve their model instances by incorporating the learned experiences of other vehicles they meet opportunistically. Instead of using the claimed location of transmitters during authentication, which may be affected by the GPS spoofing attack, their Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) features are used to estimate their current location. The estimated location is then used to predict their current CSI for authentication. Moreover, we propose a distance-based GPS signal spoofing detection algorithm, which ensures that only collaborators not under GPS spoofing attack are selected for collaborative training. The simulation results from experiments conducted using realistic channel attributes obtained from the Quasi-Deterministic Radio channel Generator (QuaDRiGa) platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in IoV scenarios, underscoring its relevance to Intelligent Transportation Systems and its superiority over existing techniques."

Through these mechanisms, AsyCo explicitly mitigates both intra- and inter-network coupling, improving training stability and reducing confirmation bias. Extensive experiments on three clinical benchmarks under limited-label regimes demonstrate that AsyCo consistently outperforms nine state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. These results indicate that AsyCo delivers accurate and reliable segmentation with minimal annotation, thereby enhancing the reliability of medical image analysis in real-world clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The IEC 60034-2-1 standard does not specify a method for three-phase line-start synchronous motors (LS-SynRMs). Although the direct input-output method can be easily applied, it does not specify how to correct the losses to a reference ambient temperature. This paper analyzes the applicability of the methods specified in the IEC 60034-2-1 standard to LS-SynRMs. The impact of ambient temperature on the full-load efficiency of LS-SynRMs is assessed. A method for segregating motor losses and correcting the average temperature and losses of the stator windings to a reference ambient temperature is proposed, ensuring that the stated full-load efficiency of the motor is determined accurately regardless of the ambient temperature in the laboratory where the tests are performed. Results from experiments conducted on two commercial LS-SynRMs are provided. It was observed that reducing the ambient temperature from 45 °C to 5 °C may increase the full-load efficiency of the tested LS-SynRMs by more than 1 percentage point, mainly due to the reduction of stator winding losses. Consequently, a motor manufacturer may consider testing this type of motor at lower ambient temperatures to achieve a higher efficiency class. Therefore, it is necessary to define a method for determining the efficiency of LS SynRMs that accounts for the correction of stator winding conduction losses to the standard reference ambient temperature of 25 °C. This paper intends to offer information that may contribute to overcoming the shortcomings and omissions of the IEC 60034-2-1 standard concerning the efficiency determination of LS-SynRMs, which is a relatively new technology on the market that is believed to be able to compete with line-operated induction motors in the low-power range, offering higher efficiency and constant operating speed."

    "abstract": "This study develops an integrated dynamic routing and off-block (IDRO) optimization framework for real-time airport surface operations. Instead of relying on complex taxi time prediction models, the proposed approach employs a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dynamic route impedance</i> formulation as a practical heuristic to capture real-time congestion conditions on the airport surface. The impedance integrates domain-specific operational factors, including free flow taxi time, turning penalties, and potential aircraft conflicts, enabling real-time route evaluation and decision-making without extensive simulation. Building upon this impedance representation, the IDRO framework coordinates both taxi routing and off-block release timing under a real-time First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) principle. The approach was implemented and tested using a high-fidelity cellular automata simulator calibrated with operational data from Beijing Capital International Airport. Compared with real-world baseline operations, the proposed framework reduced average taxi time, flight delay, and taxi conflicts by 10.43%, 24.27%, and 31.82%, respectively. A comparative study with another similar approach in the literature also reveals the advantage of the proposed strategy. These results demonstrate the framework’s computational efficiency, consistent performance across scenarios, and strong potential for real-world deployment in large-scale airport environments."

    "abstract": "Vehicular crowdsensing could enhance the traffic accident detection performance on freeways to the existing infrastructures by global task allocation. However, the uncertainty of traffic accidents and unknown of individual users bring difficulties for the task allocation. To address the problem, a global optimization method of task allocation with non-deterministic tasks and unknown users (GOTA-NU) is proposed. In the method, to reduce the influence of accident uncertainty, the accident risk is used to represent the sensing tasks of traffic accidents, and sensing task representation model is constructed by estimating the intrinsic temporal-spatial distribution of accident risk according to the wavelet transform and optimal transport theory. Meanwhile, to determine the users in future, a user estimation model is established according to macro statistical characteristics of traffic flow. Then the task allocation problem is transformed into a coverage problem for accident risk. A task allocation model is constructed by minimizing the user incentive cost with coverage level constraints of accident risk. And a greedy algorithm is proposed to solve it. To validate the proposed method, sensitivity experiments, robustness experiments, and comparison experiments are carried out on an open data source. The results show that the proposed method is efficient and reliable under different traffic conditions. The proposed method provides a reference for the long-term task allocation with non-deterministic tasks and unknown users."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently been widely used in various fields. However, both cooperative charging scheduling and insufficient charging facility problems in UAV charging scenarios have been rarely studied. This paper studies parallel cooperative charging scheduling of UAVs. We adopt cooperative charging to reduce the total cost and parallel scheduling to enable UAVs can be charged even if the number of UAVs is more than the number of charging facilities. We formulate the Parallel Cooperative Charging Scheduling for UAVs Problem (PCCSUP) for optimizing the total cost of whole charging system. We first investigate the special case of PCCSUP with single charging station, and use the approximation algorithm for Uniform Parallel Machines Scheduling Problem (UPMSP) to solve the special case. Then, a greedy approach based approximation algorithm is proposed to solve the PCCSUP, where we use the approximation algorithm for UPMSP to obtain the charging arrangements and the Set Covering Problem (SCP) optimization framework to obtain the charging groups. The results of extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm can reduce up to 59.81% total cost compared with the benchmark algorithms. Finally, we discuss and design the algorithms for three related problems: PCCSUP with different arrival times, PCCSUP with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>-anonymity, and charging arrangements for excluded UAVs."

    "abstract": "Multiple autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) system is consisting of multi-AAVs through collaborative techniques to efficiently accomplish various tasks in complex scenarios. Collision free flocking and navigation strategies for multi-AAVs in complex dynamic environments are still challenging in several aspects: real-time collision avoidance of dynamic obstacles, complexity of collaborative multi-AAV path planning, and group stagnation problem due to local optimization in dynamic environments. Traditional flocking algorithms usually rely on strict rules with limited adaptability to different environments. While Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a flexible and model-free framework, is able to solve some of the problems through autonomous exploration, it still suffers from challenges such as sample inefficiency, unstable training process, easy to fall into local optimums of the policy, and difficult to converge in sparse reward scenarios. In order to improve the training efficiency, we propose an improved algorithm called Curriculum-based Heuristic Guidance TD3 (CHTD3) for solving collision-free flocking and navigation of multiple AAVs in dynamic environments. The core idea is to decompose the task of AAV collision avoidance and navigation in dynamic environments into multiple sub-tasks and gradually increase the number of sub-tasks in a staged manner, while combining the heuristic rules with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to solve the problem of prolonged learning cycle commonly found in the traditional RL methods. In addition, to better cope with complex and dynamic environments, we customize a risk assessment criterion and introduce a Human-AAV Collaboration (HAC) mechanism to enable the human operator to intervene at necessary moments to assist the AAV's motion decision. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CHTD3-HAC approach in multi-AAVs collision-free flocking and navigation."
