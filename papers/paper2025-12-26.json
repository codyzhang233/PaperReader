    "abstract": "While semantic communications has shown great potential in single-user settings, interference over a shared multiple access channel (MAC) remains a key challenge in multi-user scenarios. In this letter, we propose a novel joint source-channel coding scheme with interference-mitigation learning (JSCC-IM) for task-oriented multi-user semantic communications. The proposed JSCC-IM employs a single-layer decoder to separate desired semantic features from multi-user interference in the aggregated signals over MAC. Then, we design a loss function that explicitly suppresses multi-user interference while preserving desired semantic features. Simulation results show that the JSCC-IM improves inference accuracy over conventional JSCC schemes by more than 5% and 3% in multi-user semantic inference and multi-view semantic fusion, respectively."

    "abstract": "Lightning is a leading cause of wind turbine blade failures in the United States and globally, resulting in significant financial losses for the industry. Rapid detection of turbine strikes is essential to reduce these costs. While nearby lightning strikes can be detected with high accuracy, confirming whether a specific turbine was struck remains challenging. Current confirmation relies on manual inspections with drones, which may take hours to years if damage develops slowly during operation. This work presents a unified three-step framework for strike confirmation that integrates lightning measurements, turbine alarms, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)-based anomaly detection. The first step analyzes the amplitude (in kA) and distance of nearby lightning strikes. The second evaluates alarms historically associated with lightning damage by analyzing data from affected turbines. The third applies machine learning–based anomaly detection to SCADA signals, focusing on rotor speed, wind speed, and pitch angles following a nearby event. The approach was evaluated on 26 U.S. turbines confirmed to have been struck between 2021 and 2024, along with 1650 turbines that experienced nearby strikes without direct impact. Obtaining 26 cases with precisely verified strike times represents a unique dataset in the wind energy domain, enabling model training and validation under real-world conditions. The models are designed for fleet-wide application, demonstrating scalability. At the highest confidence level, recall and precision were 96% and 86%; at the next level, 100% and 81%. Deployment across Vestas' U.S. fleet could conservatively save over <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\$}$</tex-math></inline-formula>16 million annually in avoided blade repair costs, not including additional savings from reduced turbine downtime, and thereby contribute to lowering the levelized cost of electricity for wind energy."

    "abstract": "Classifying drugs into symptomatic (SYM) and disease-modifying (DM) categories is essential for understanding their therapeutic effect and plays a key role in drug repurposing. While many computational approaches focus on drug-target prediction, they often ignore the nature of the drug's action on disease progression. This study proposes a graph-based strategy to classify drugs as SYM or DM based on their effect on disease treatment. We construct a heterogeneous network comprising genes, diseases, and drugs, and apply a guided shortest path traversal framework for drug effect classification. During this traversal, certain genes appear frequently in the shortest metapaths linking diseases and drugs. These recurrent genes are identified based on their frequency of occurrence in known drug-disease paths. For a new drug-disease pair, if the traversal path contains recurrent genes marked for a specific treatment type, we classify the drug accordingly. Over and above classifying the drugs, the proposed method incorporates the metapath-based framework to improve interpretability. Experimental results show that our model achieves significantly better classification accuracy compared to advanced machine learning and deep learning methods. A case study on multiple sclerosis further supports the biological relevance of our approach.

    "abstract": "Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has emerged as a disruptive paradigm for mobile networks, aiming to disaggregate traditional RAN functions into software-based components connected via open, interoperable interfaces. By enabling multi-vendor integration, programmability through rApps and xApps, and cloud-native deployments, O-RAN promises to foster innovation, cost efficiency, and operational flexibility. However, validating its feasibility and performance requires realistic experimentation and the use of testbeds. This paper provides a review and practical evaluation of O-RAN testbeds, ranging from experimental deployments to fully simulated frameworks. We first introduce the architectural principles of O-RAN, highlighting its key components, functional splits, and open interfaces. Next, we survey relevant research testbeds and prototypes reported in the literature, analyzing their architectures, design choices, and lessons learned. Finally, we reproduce and assess four representative implementations, including the NIST automation framework and ns-3–based O-RAN simulators. A comparative analysis is presented, discussing advantages, limitations, and alignment with evolving O-RAN standards. Our findings indicate that while automation frameworks simplify reproducibility and simulation frameworks enable flexible experimentation, interoperability issues and the lack of maturity in the Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Non-RT RIC) remain open challenges. These insights can guide researchers and operators in designing future O-RAN testbeds and accelerating the adoption of open and smart RAN solutions."

This paper investigates the deployment of drone-based auxiliary networks in large-scale event scenarios, where conventional cellular systems often face capacity overload due to sudden user density spikes. A major challenge in this context is maintaining stable drone-user associations under scenarios with a high density of mobile users and limited drone resources. Hence, we propose a user association policy that relies on physical layer information to determine to which drone a user should associate. The proposal, namely Received Signal Strength Indicator-driven Association Policy (RDAP), is comparatively evaluated against other association policies using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3). We assess the average end-to-end delay and jitter, the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), the number of re-associations, and the control overhead as a function of the number of users in the network. The results show that RDAP delivers more packets with lower delay and jitter, by increasing the number of users associated with better quality drone-to-user links, achieving a 12.37% improvement in PDR, at the cost of increasing the control overhead."

However, STT MRAM requires large current densities, resulting in limited scalability and energy inefficiency. Voltage-controlled precessional (VCP) MRAM can mitigate this problem by reducing current requirements by two orders of magnitude, but suffers from high write error rate (WER) due to sensitivity to the write pulse duration (WPD) and process and temperature variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a voltage-controlled deterministic precessional (VCDP) MRAM, which realizes robust deterministic switching via magnetoresistance-induced energy asymmetry. Fokker-Planck simulations confirm low WER of 10-9 with a WPD of 23.7 ns and energy consumption of 110.9 fJ/bit, validating VCDP MRAM as a promising candidate for storage-class or main memory applications."

    "abstract": "Space exploration involves activities such as inspection, refueling, upgrading, repairing worn space objects, rescuing damaged satellites, removing orbital debris, building and maintaining orbital assets, infrastructures, or maintenance assistance, conducting scientific experiments in space, and missions for planetary explorations. To accomplish such complex tasks in the space environment, space robots are preferred for these activities. The end effector of a space robot is usually associated with a contact force when manipulating or capturing objects in space. Researchers have reported that the excess contact force between the space robot and the captured target object causes damage to both the robot and the target object. The successful manipulation of such objects by robotic systems is crucial for ensuring the safety of the robot and the object in space. This article introduces a novel approach to minimize contact forces during space robot captures by employing a hybrid method that combines configuration optimization techniques with desired trajectory planning and the advanced control method of sliding mode control (SMC). This study aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of object manipulation in a challenging space environment. A holistic and modern particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed for the contact force minimization. Extensive numerical simulations in MATLAB were performed for the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Dense wireless network (DWN) scenarios are more likely to suffer from the problem of hidden terminals and consequently an increase in collisions as they support a large number of stations in a limited geographic area. While the Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism introduced by IEEE 802.11ah reduces the levels of contention by separating nodes into groups with exclusive transmission slots, it does not take hidden terminals into account and, therefore, is still susceptible to collisions caused by them. Recently, a spectral clustering algorithm showed potential in finding more efficient RAW groups to reduce hidden terminals, increasing DWN performance. However, because its execution time is very high, in this paper, we propose a faster approach. Our proposal uses a recursive divide and conquer strategy, replacing the full spectral clustering with several executions of a simpler binary split. Simulation results indicate that the proposed recursive clustering algorithm still significantly outperforms the standard IEEE 802.11ah grouping in terms of pairs of hidden terminals, while performing close to the original spectral clustering, but with much lower execution time."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy necessitates battery energy storage systems (BESS) to ensure grid stability. To achieve higher voltages, multiple battery packs are typically connected in series, making state-of-charge (SOC) balancing among different packs critical for safe and stable operation. This paper employed the Switch-Multiplexing coupled Multi-Resonant Switched-Capacitor Converter (SMX-MRSCC) topology for battery equalization due to its cost-effectiveness achieved through switching devices reuse. However, this multiplexing also introduces coupling in SOC control between packs. Conventional strategies rely on continuous regulation of phase-shift ratios for decoupled control, often compromising soft-switching operation and increasing power reflux. To address this issue, a novel phase-shift control strategy is proposed in this paper. The phase-shift ratios are discretized into three predefined states: forward/reverse states and an idle state, optimized to achieve low reflux power, and low RMS current and peak current under soft-switching constraints. Specifically, to realize efficient equalization by fixed operating states, the state selection for phase-shift ratios of every two adjacent half-bridge is dynamically determined based on the accumulated imbalance energy (AIE) of the upstream battery packs, which minimizes energy interaction through path optimization. Therefore, the proposed approach enhances equalization efficiency by component-level optimal design and system-level energy transfer path optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving efficient SOC balancing for series-connected battery packs."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of e-commerce has transformed customer feedback into a multimodal medium, encompassing not only text but also speech, images, and video reviews. Traditional unimodal sentiment analysis approaches—predominantly text-based—fail to capture the rich emotional cues embedded in voice tone, facial expressions, and visual context, often resulting in misclassification in cases of irony or ambiguous expressions. Recent multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) studies have explored fusion strategies across text, audio, and video, but most existing methods either rely on computationally heavy architectures or prioritize text while underutilizing non-textual modalities. This study introduces AViSE-Net (Audio–Video Squeeze-Excitation Network), a lightweight yet discriminative multimodal framework that leverages dilated CNNs for audio and an SE-enhanced MobileNetV2 backbone for video and image data. Key innovations include (i) dilated convolutions in the audio branch for efficient long-range temporal modelling, (ii) channel-wise recalibration through Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks in the video pathway, (iii) fusion with LayerNorm and GELU activations for stable cross-modal integration, and (iv) a progressive unfreezing strategy to accelerate convergence while preserving pretrained visual features. Evaluated on a curated multimodal dataset of customer product reviews, AViSE-Net achieves 97.9% accuracy with ~50% fewer parameters than heavy baseline models such as BiLSTM+ResNet18, while maintaining real-time inference speeds of ~42 fps on GPU. Comparative experiments and ablation studies confirm that each architectural enhancement contributes significantly to the superior performance. These results establish AViSE-Net as a compact, scalable, and deployment-ready solution for real-world multimodal sentiment analysis in e-commerce and consumer feedback applications."

This work proposes a novel data-driven framework for early warning of bridge collapse risk, leveraging Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) displacement time series and Deep Learning. A mathematical formulation of a bridge-collapse risk index is introduced, allowing quantitative estimation of the probability of failure from displacement data. To overcome data scarcity, a synthetic bridge dataset is generated through a combination of geometrical transformations and stochastic perturbations applied to real InSAR observations. Then, a Multi-Head Attention-based Neural Network is trained to predict the risk increment over time windows, using both on-bridge and surrounding geospatial points as input. The model is validated on the historical collapse of the Tadcaster bridge and stress tested on the Cantiano bridge, which failed during the 2022 Marche flood in Italy. The results show that the proposed approach effectively captures the temporal evolution of structural instability, with a conservative (risk-overestimating) but consistent prediction trend. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining InSAR data and attention-based Deep Learning models for scalable, non-invasive bridge health monitoring."

    "abstract": "Current multi-band SAR feature extraction methods often fail to adequately exploit intra-band details and inter-band spectral relationships, limiting their classification performance. To address this, in this paper, a novel band-enhanced tensor-based multi-band SAR feature extraction method is proposed for land cover classification. It first constructs a fourth-order feature tensor by aggregating Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features from spatial neighborhoods, effectively capturing multi-band spatial-spectral characteristics. Subsequently, a Band-enhanced Tensor Discriminant Locality Preserving Projection (BTDLPP) method is proposed to project the high-dimensional feature tensor to a discriminative compact subspace. BTDLPP innovatively integrates manifold structure preservation with linear discriminant analysis by formulating an objective function that simultaneously maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter and the manifold structural distortion. For the band mode, diagonal dominance and correlation guided regularization terms are added to the optimization objective function to enhance band information through weighted fusion. This approach enables comprehensive extraction of both linear and nonlinear discriminative features while jointly exploring intra- and inter-band features. Experiments on multi-band SAR datasets in Wanning and Sheyang regions demonstrate that, compared to the conventional tensor subspace projection methods, the feature space extracted by the proposed method simultaneously exhibits better linear separability and the preservation of manifold structures, leading to higher land cover classification accuracy.

Also, the data privacy breaches in power systems have become increasingly prominent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a self-adaptive federated learning (SaFL)-based Dynamic-Static Integrated State Estimation (DSISE) method for the coordinated transmission-distribution (T&D) networks. A DSISE model is constructed where the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based dynamic state estimation is for the transmission network, and the Weighted Least Square (WLS)-based static state estimation is for the multi-area three-phase unbalanced distribution network. Considering the privacy preservation of each area of the distribution network, a novel three-layer Federated Learning (FL) is proposed with an intermediate server layer to significantly reduce the communication cost, which readily emerges from the traditional two-layer FL. The proposed method is validated on the improved IEEE-39 and IEEE-123 T&D coordinated networks. Compared with existing FL, the proposed SaFL can improve the accuracy of voltage angle and magnitude state estimation by 10.73% and 13.49%, respectively."

To tackle these challenges, we introduce the notion of optimal and greedy excitation sets, which contain data points with sufficient richness to aid in the identification task. We then present the greedy excitation set-based recursive least squares algorithm to alleviate the problem of the lack of persistent excitation, and prove that the iterates generated by the proposed algorithm minimize an auxiliary weighted least squares cost function. When data points are generated from time-varying parameters, online estimators tend to underfit the true parameter trajectory, and their predictability deteriorates. To tackle this problem, we propose a memory resetting scheme leveraging change-point detection techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms via a numerical case study to learn the time-varying parameters of networked epidemic dynamics, and compare it to results obtained using conventional approaches."

These tasks involve finger flexion, flexion angle and fingertip force. However, few studies have simultaneously recognized these motion information, and applied them to real-time prosthetic hand control. In this paper, we present a wearable high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based system for simultaneous recognition of finger flexion, flexion angle and fingertip force. The system incorporates a flexible and stretchable electrode array with a portable wireless acquisition device to record high-resolution and high-sampling-rate sEMG data. Then, a convolutional neural network processes three-dimensional (3D) sEMG data was introduced to decode finger flexion, flexion angle and fingertip force. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing the 3D sEMG data improves classification accuracy by over 7% compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D) sEMG data. Furthermore, we validated the real-time performance of the developed system by controlling a prosthetics hand to perform finger flexions with different flexion angles and fingertip forces. As a practical application, translating the recognition results into real-time prosthetics control successfully demonstrated the system’s capability to replicate diverse sphygmopalpation gestures, highlighting the system’s potential for clinical diagnostics and other high-precision applications."

The proposed method initially employs the positioning equation to transform the positioning result coordinates into a three-dimensional vector with z as the sole unknown quantity. Subsequently, the value of z is iteratively adjusted to obtain the latitude-longitude-altitude coordinates of the target. Finally, the value of z is corrected using the known prior elevation to achieve time difference of arrival localization. This approach circumvents the need to solve a quartic equation. Theoretical and simulation analyses indicate that the proposed method has lower computational complexity compared to the analytic method while exhibiting relatively high positioning accuracy."

    "abstract": "In many speech recording applications, noise and acoustic echo corrupt the desired speech. Consequently, combined noise reduction (NR) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is required. Generally, a cascade approach is followed, i.e., the AEC and NR are designed in isolation by selecting a separate signal model, separate cost function, and separate solution strategy. The AEC and NR are then cascaded one after the other, not accounting for their interaction. In this paper, an integrated approach is proposed to consider this interaction in a general multi-microphone/ multi- loudspeaker setup. Therefore, a single signal model of either the microphone signal vector or the extended signal vector, obtained by stacking microphone and loudspeaker signals, is selected, a single mean squared error cost function is formulated, and a common solution strategy is used. Using this microphone signal model, a multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) is derived. Using the extended signal model, it is shown that an extended MWF (MWF<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub>) can be derived, and several equivalent expressions can be found, which are nevertheless shown to be interpretable as cascade algorithms. Specifically, the MWF<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub> is shown to be equivalent to algorithms where the AEC precedes the NR (AEC-NR), the NR precedes the AEC (NR-AEC), and the extended NR (NR<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub>) precedes the AEC and post-filter (PF) (NR<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub>-AEC-PF).

The establishment of an accurate model is essential for the optimization. Therefore a novel electromagnetic-thermal-fluid multi-physics coupling model (EM-T-F MCM) for the oil-immersed AFHM is developed based on the thermal network method (TNM). This model comprehensively considers the effects of temperature on the conductivity of windings and silicon steel, the performance of PMs, and the thermophysical properties of the cooling medium. Compared to traditional coupling models, the average prediction accuracy of the EM-T-F MCM is enhanced by 4.17%, and it has been validated under both dynamic and steady-state conditions. Then, an improved NSGA-II is proposed for multi-objective optimization of AFHMs based on the EM-T-F MCM. Finally, a prototype motor is fabricated, and the test platform is built to verify the validity of AFHMs and the proposed method. The results indicate that the optimized AFHM torque is improved by approximately 8% with nearly 50% reduced torque ripples, while the high-efficiency operation region is expanded by approximately 18%."

Magnetic dipole theory guides the design of covert magnetic labels, and the imaging mechanism of the sensor informs the development of a handheld detection device. By embedding the label into food packaging, the system establishes an invisible anti-counterfeiting feature. It captures the magnetic image of labels through a magnetic image sensor and performs real-time authentication using a lightweight recognition algorithm on an embedded microcontroller. The results are wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone for user verification. Experimental evaluations confirm excellent imaging consistency and signal stability. The system remains robust under electromagnetic interference and temperature variations, achieving an identification accuracy exceeding 99.9% in the conducted experiments on packaged grain and oil products. Owing to its strong concealment, environmental adaptability, and resistance to duplication, the system offers a practical and efficient anti-counterfeiting solution with significant potential for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "Logical anomalies occur when a product's assembly violates prescribed logical rules, which widely exist in industrial assembly and packaging processes. Due to the difficulty in comprehending such complex logical relationships, a paucity of research has focused on the industrial logical anomaly diagnosis (LAD). Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot reasoning capabilities, making them a promising tool for LAD. However, directly applying LLMs to LAD still face two critical challenges: 1) the scarcity of abnormal samples in real-world settings, and 2) the propensity of LLMs to generate hallucinated or unreliable diagnostic conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose LogiDiag, a novel diagnostic reasoning method for LAD, to pinpoint where and why a product fails to comply with the logical rules, thereby elevating product quality and reducing remedial intervention cost. We design a visual descriptor that identifies product component attributes even in out-of-distribution abnormal images and organizes them into component descriptions for LLMs' comprehension. To mitigate hallucinations, we devise a planner to guide LLMs in diagnostic reasoning through rule orchestration, tool allocation, and chain-of-diagnosis generation. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets validate the competitive performance of LogiDiag."

    "abstract": "Traditional single-kernel or fixed-center multi kernel collaborative correntropies fundamentally assume that errors primarily cluster around a central point (typically zero). However, in real-world complex noise environments—such as those generated by mixed interference sources with diverse mechanisms—errors may exhibit multi-modal or highly asymmetric statistical characteristics. In such cases, a single central point or multi-kernels fixed at the origin cannot effectively capture the true shape of the error distribution. To address these problems, this letter proposes a novel robust learning algorithm by introducing variable-center multi-kernel correntropy into an asymmetric correntropy framework, where the kernel centers can be positioned at arbitrary locations. Compared with the maximum asymmetric correntropy criterion (MACC) algorithm, the proposed approach offers a more generalized formulation that enhances its capability to handle more complex error distributions, thereby improving algorithm performance. Notably, existing literature has not yet provided theoretical analysis for such variable-center multi-kernel asymmetric correntropy robust algorithms. Therefore, the main contributions of this work include: conducting the first theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm, and validating the effectiveness of the analytical methodology."

    "abstract": "The reliability of power module packaging insulation is critical for the stable and safe operation of high-voltage power devices. Within the module packaging, the interface between the encapsulation and the ceramic substrate represents a critical weak point, where dielectric discontinuities under applied voltage can cause interfacial charge accumulation, distort the electric field, and, in severe cases, compromise insulation performance. Understanding the interfacial charge dynamics is therefore essential for ensuring long-term reliability. This study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of interfacial charges in power module silicone-direct bond copper (DBC) packaging under DC and unipolar square wave voltages using a non-invasive electrostatic induction method. The results show that DC voltage induces approximately twice as much interfacial charge accumulation as square wave conditions. However, under square wave voltage, the charge decay rate is more slowly. Subsequently, the possible generation of interfacial charges are discussed, including electrode injection, impurity ionization, and Maxwell-Wagner polarization. Moreover, two types of trap states are identified. Shallow traps are likely related to intrinsic defects and present similar depth despite of waveform and field strength. In contrast, the formation of deep traps is more complex. Although a DC electric field results in a larger amount of charge being trapped, a square-wave electric field drives the charges into deeper trap states. These findings highlight the combined influence of Maxwell-Wagner polarization and space-charge effects on interfacial charge dynamics, providing key insights into the mechanisms governing insulation aging and strategies for improving insulation reliability."

A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenizing continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES."

To ensure hardware implementation in practice, the framework provides sufficient robustness against model uncertainties, minimizes the medium-high frequency oscillations caused by dead-time and switching interactions with the LCL filter, and prevents high-magnitude oscillations in the modulating signal to avoid saturation and performance degradation. For this purpose, loop-shaping weighting functions and D-stability techniques are employed, and the problem is formulated using linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the proposed method integrates a Kalman filter to balance oscillation levels in the control input and to prevent modulating signal saturation. The filter dynamics are integrated into the design model to ensure the stability of the entire control structure. Simulation and experimental results, including the real-time simulation done using an OPAL-RT platform, confirm the superior performance, robustness, and practical feasibility of the developed control strategy in achieving accurate active and reactive power reference tracking while lowering the total harmonic distortion, even with weak grids and during generation-side disturbances. In contrast, other methods may encounter significant issues in the experimental setting, making their practical implementation challenging."

This paper introduces a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Density-Adaptive Fusion Network (DSDAF) designed to address the challenges of multi-modal trajectory prediction in dynamic traffic scenarios. To capture the spatiotemporal dependencies between vehicles, we utilize the multi-head attention mechanism to model their dynamic interaction. We further propose a dynamic density-aware adaptive mechanism that employs a transformer-based local vehicle density prediction network to quantify future traffic states and dynamically integrate them with historical trajectory information, thereby enabling adaptive prediction under real-time traffic conditions. Additionally, we propose an interpretable decoder architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), which decomposes driving behaviors into lateral and longitudinal components. By leveraging learnable activation functions and dynamic attention mechanisms, our model generates more accurate intention representations and multimodal trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in long-term predictions, while ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component."

Conventional denoising methods often struggle to effectively handle high-resolution satellite imagery, leading to loss of fine textures and structural integrity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Convolutional Sparse Representation (CSR) based denoising framework that integrates adaptive Total Variation (TV) regularization with noise specific data fidelity terms. For Gaussian noise, an L2TV model is employed to ensure smooth restoration, while for Impulse noise, an L1TV model is utilized to robustly suppress sparse outliers. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior quantitative performance in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Visual Information Fidelity (VIF), Figure of Merit (FOM) as well as improved visual quality when compared with traditional and contemporary state-of-the-art techniques.

    "abstract": "Robotic rotational nanomanipulation is crucial in fields like nanomaterial defect detection, nanoscale three-dimensional observation, and nanomaterial twisting characterization. In-situ rotation within a scanning electron microscope is challenging due to restricted workspace, limited field of view (FOV), depth of field (DoF), and large position shifts from rotation axis misalignment. Conventional solutions primarily employ nanorobots with extra structures to align the object with the rotation axis. However, this requires additional motion or observation units for the nanorobot, which either occupies multiple linear degrees of freedom or significantly consumes the limited workspace, thereby greatly impeding the dexterity. The novelty of this article resides in developing a control-oriented discrete time state-space model coupled with systematic calibration methodologies for axis and misalignment quantification. Through kinematic modeling rather than dynamic analysis, this approach enables real-time compensation of positional drift via outer-loop control strategies while maintaining compatibility with confined work space. Subsequently, we propose an iterative learning-based controller to enhance the response in subsequent iterations, thereby achieving high-precision off-axis in-situ rotation. Finally, a Barrier Lyapunov Function ensures the end-effector remains within the FOV and DoF, effectively mitigating visual servo singularities. Experimental validation against PID control and model predictive control demonstrates the strategy’s stability, reliability, and superiority."

Conventional MPCC requires evaluating 91 effective voltage vectors (VVs), resulting in high computational complexity. To address this, a cascaded splitsequence strategy is proposed that projects the 3D VVs onto the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}$</tex> plane, selects candidate VVs for the first inverter, refines the candidate set for the second inverter, and finally chooses the optimal VVs based on zero-sequence components. This method reduces predictive iterations from 91 to 23 -a 75 % reduction—and eliminates the need for weight coefficients. Additionally, a multi-mode switching strategy is integrated to reduce the power loss over a wide speed range: under lowspeed conditions, only the low-voltage side inverter is active; during medium-speed operation, the high-voltage side inverter is engaged; and at high speeds, both inverters operate concurrently. Experimental results demonstrate significant computational efficiency and robust performance, making the proposed MPCC well suited for high-performance industrial applications."

It reveals that the MOS-channel and the body diode are not two independent current paths when the MOS-channel is turned on; instead, the MOS-channel suppresses the conduction capability of the body diode. This results in weaker surge current capability under positive Vgs compared to negative Vgs, which depends on pulse width and case temperature. The underlying mechanism is an elevated potential around the p-well region when the MOS-channel is turned on, which reduces the effective conduction area of the body diode. This mechanism is elucidated through TCAD simulations and validated by experimental results. These findings enhance the understanding of the surge current performance of planar mosfets under varying gate bias conditions."

    "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption accelerates across industries, the need for robust real-time cybersecurity solutions becomes increasingly critical. Traditional security frameworks that rely on static rules, signature-based detection, and threshold alerts struggle to detect sophisticated identity-based attacks that exploit behavioral anomalies rather than explicit policy violations. These limitations, combined with the growing volume of telemetry data and the latency of conventional detection methods, leave organizations vulnerable to prolonged breaches and data exfiltration. This paper presents a use case with a scalable, AI-driven approach to sensitive data leak detection using NVIDIA Morpheus, a GPU-accelerated cybersecurity framework. We demonstrate how Morpheus, in conjunction with NVIDIA BlueField DPUs and DOCA, enables high-throughput, low-latency inspection of real-time network telemetry without impacting system performance. The solution leverages a pre-trained NLP-based Sensitive Information Detection model capable of identifying ten categories of sensitive data within packet payloads, including credentials, PII, and cryptographic keys. Network-captured PCAP data serialized in JSONlines format passes through a linear, feed-forward Morpheus pipeline, configured via CLI and powered by Triton Inference Server with dynamic batching for optimized inference. The final output provides binary classification results that indicate the presence or absence of sensitive information. This case study illustrates how AI-enhanced telemetry analysis can significantly reduce detection and response times, offering a proactive defense mechanism against modern cyber threats."

Although numerous lightweight object detectors have been proposed, there exists a lack of rigorous, cross-platform benchmarks that evaluate these models under consistent conditions for small-object-focused applications. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of eight recent lightweight You Look Only Once (YOLO)-based models, including YOLOX-Nano and YOLOv6–v12 variants. Models are trained using a unified pipeline and evaluated on three representative datasets: VisDrone2019, DOTA-v1.5, and xView. Performance is assessed on both cloud GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and an edge AI platform (Jetson Orin Nano), using PyTorch and TensorRT (FP16) runtimes. The evaluation metrics include mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, F1-score, latency, FPS, memory footprint, and energy consumption (via VDD_IN telemetry). Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-Nano and YOLOv9-Tiny achieve leading accuracy across datasets, while YOLOv6-Nano and YOLOv10-Nano offer favorable trade-offs in speed and memory. TensorRT optimization yields 3×–5× speedup over PyTorch. Energy draw ranges from 7.6 W to 10.4 W, depending on the model and configuration. Pareto frontiers reveal that no single model dominates across all objectives. The study highlights the importance of multi-objective benchmarking in edge AI and provides practical guidance for selecting detectors based on deployment-specific constraints. The findings support theory-driven and application-oriented advancement of efficient detection architectures for real-time, resource-aware computer vision systems."

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) has garnered considerable attention due to its relevance in practical applications such as automated devices in smart cities. However, under complex conditions, existing trackers often fail to accurately capture or characterize target motion patterns, exhibiting limitations in flexibility and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CHTracker, a confidence-guided hierarchical association paradigm for MOT. By integrating spatial features with varying confidence levels, CHTracker enhances the granularity of motion pattern modeling in edge-case scenarios where conventional trackers are prone to association ambiguity. Our paradigm adaptively utilizes distinct tracking cues and assignment metrics tailored to hierarchical target structures, thereby enabling collaborative tracking. Additionally, CHTracker incorporates the diagonal length of the target bounding box as a state variable during position prediction, which significantly improves the robustness against diverse motion noise. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including Dance-Track, MOT17, MOT20, and Singapore Maritime Dataset (SMD), demonstrate that CHTracker achieves the state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Furthermore, our association paradigm is extended to a visible-infrared fusion version for evaluation on the multimodal CAMEL dataset, underscoring its practical potential to fulfill heterogeneous modality requirements in real-world scenarios. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ZyanChenyang/CHTracker."

    "abstract": "In pliable index coding (PICOD), a number of clients are connected via a noise-free broadcast channel to a server which has a list of messages. Each client has a unique subset of messages at the server as side-information, and requests for any one message not in the side-information. A PICOD scheme of length ℓ is a set of ℓ encoded transmissions broadcast from the server such that all clients are satisfied. Finding the optimal (minimum) length of PICOD and designing PICOD schemes that have small length are the fundamental questions in PICOD. In this paper, we use a hypergraph-based approach to derive new achievability and converse results for PICOD(t), where clients request <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i> new messages (for some <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i> ≥ 1). We present a simple greedy algorithm for PICOD(1), termed DelGreedy, which gives an achievable linear scheme with length at most Δ(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>), where Δ(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>) is the maximum degree of any vertex in the hypergraph <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i> that represents the PICOD problem. We then extend this idea to obtain an achievable scheme for PICOD(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>). We also give a lower bound for the optimal PICOD length using a new structural parameter associated with the PICOD hypergraph called the nesting number, denoted by η(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>). While the nesting number bound is not stronger than previously known bounds, it can provide some computational advantages over them. Also, using the nesting number bound, we also obtain novel lower bounds for some PICOD problems with special structures, which are tight in some cases. We also characterize the optimal PICOD lengths for problems with Δ(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>) ∈ {1, 2, 3}, and for problems with upto three clients. Further, we present a class of PICOD problems to show that the gap between the lower bound η(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>) and the achievable PICOD length from DelGreedy algorithm can be arbitrarily large. Finally, we demonstrate the achievable PICOD lengths from our algorithms via simulations on randomly generated PICOD problems, and compare it with existing algorithms. We observe that DelGreedy performs better than some existing algorithms, while being worse than others, in terms of the code length achieved. Specifically, the greedy-cover based algorithm from a prior work of Brahma and Fragouli performs better, achieving lengths 1.5x-2x smaller than DelGreedy. However, the DelGreedy algorithm demonstrates 1.5x-3x faster running times than GRCOV, providing an alternative point in the rate-computation tradeoff of PICOD code design. These results extend to the PICOD(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</i>) scenario also, with the improvements in computation-time over pre-existing algorithms being more dramatic in some cases."

    "abstract": "Key factors of resource allocation in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access systems are: allocation optimal RISs and subsequent resource blocks (RBs) to the UEs. Selecting an appropriate RIS based on the channel state information incurs high channel estimation overhead, thus leaving little time for actual data communication. Moreover, a line of sight (LoS) between the RIS element and UE is needed to ensure significant channel gain at the UE over the millimeter-wave channels. In this work, a resource allocation algorithm is proposed, where each UE selects an appropriate RIS using the multi-agent multi-arm bandit framework, accounting for both channel gain and the possibility of LoS blockage by the dynamic obstacles. The UEs are then grouped according to the selected RIS. Subsequently, RBs are allocated to UE groups with the aim to maximize the sum rate, ensuring that the UEs with the worst channel conditions receive the requested data rate, by solving the underlying maximum weight bipartite matching problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state of the art approaches in terms of sum data rate and proportion of UEs achieving the required data rate."

Most existing methods rely on single features and struggle to integrate structural and sequential drug information. Additionally, prediction bias caused by class imbalance remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, this study proposes a multi-source example-driven learning framework for DDI (MEDL-DDI) that jointly models structural and sequential drug representations to achieve robust multimodal fusion and mitigate class imbalance. MEDL-DDI enriches SMILES with chemical knowledge, extracts global semantic features via a Transformer, and identifies key substructures through a graph information bottleneck. Moreover, an example-driven mechanism guided by example centers enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate that MEDL-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The case study on cardiovascular drug interactions further highlights MEDL-DDI's practical value and applicability."

    "abstract": "While it is well known that a Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV) heavily distorts the voltage wave of a high-current lightning impulse, less has been said about waveform distortions observed during power frequency testing. This paper shows that significant distortions are likely produced by practical generators during power frequency testing of MOVs, with the effect that average power dissipation of MOVs and surge arresters is severely impacted by generator setup. Four distribution transformer configurations with different output impedances were used to apply 60 Hz voltage waves to a conducting, 5 kV-rated MOV at six peak current levels. Distortion was found to be a function of generator impedance and current magnitude. In one typical experiment, even a slight distortion (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub> / (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">peak</sub> / <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\surd {2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) = 1.014) led to  33% decrease in average power dissipation compared to that of a distortion-free wave of the same rms voltage. Without consideration of these effects, seemingly minor differences in procedure can cause parts to erroneously pass or fail tests prescribed in IEEE C62.11 (2020) or IEC 60099-4 ed. 3.0, leading to arresters not meeting manufacturers' 60 Hz TOV claims. A method is also outlined to correct for waveform distortion, enabling calculation of distortion-free average power dissipation."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a fixed-time output-feedback approximate optimal control strategy for the multi-pursuer single-evader game, addressing challenges of incomplete information, unknown lumped disturbances, thrust limits, and time restrictions. First, an incomplete information game model for both the pursuer and the evader is established derived from spacecraft relative motion dynamics model. A fixed-time extended state observer (FxTESO) is designed to estimate unknown disturbances and the evader maneuver strategies, avoiding the requirement for relative velocity measurement information, whose accuracy is significantly compromised by the evader's maneuvers. For operational safety concerns, the forbidden zone is incorporated into the pursuers' control strategy, utilizing a set of superquadric surfaces to accurately encapsulate the evader's total structure to mitigate collision risks during the mission. Finally, a fixed-time neural adaptive output-feedback controller is designed by integrating the FxTESO and the online learning adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technology via neural networks (NNs), to achieve real-time solutions for the optimal control strategies of the pursuers. Enabled by the designed nonsingular fixed-time state compensation term, the system state will converge within a fixed time independent of the initial state. The Lyapunov theory is applied to prove the stability of the system under the proposed controller. Building on this foundation, a null-space-based (NSB) task planning scheme is proposed incorporating relative-distance-dependent priority metrics, to generate the escape strategy of the evader against multiple pursuers, while avoiding potential conflicts between the escape strategies. Numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

    "abstract": "This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Cooperative non orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) systems, where cooperative relaying enhances reliability, extends coverage, and strengthens system robustness. The study begins by classifying the fundamental structures of C-NOMA into two key categories: user-assisted relaying, where end-user devices forward information to other users, and dedicated relaying, where separate relay nodes assist transmission. Beyond its basic principles, the survey explores the integration of C-NOMA with advanced technologies such as cognitive radio (CR), full-duplex (FD) transmission, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), power line communication (PLC), multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), heterogeneous networks (HetNets), rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), visible light communication (VLC), and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). These integrations significantly improve energy efficiency, spectral utilization, and coverage reliability. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI), including deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and federated learning (FL), is identified as a vital enabler for intelligent power allocation, relay selection, and user clustering, addressing the limitations of traditional optimization approaches. This survey elaborates in detail the integration of C-NOMA with blockchain, edge computing, quantum computing, extended reality (XR) i.e., virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Furthermore, this survey identifies quantum-enabled C-NOMA as a transformative paradigm, where quantum key distribution (QKD) ensures physical layer security (PLS), and quantum machine learning (QML) enhances interference mitigation and large-scale optimization. Performance evaluation in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency, and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is critically analyzed, with special emphasis on challenges such as accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition, robust successive interference cancellation (SIC), scalable relay selection, and security in heterogeneous environments. In summary, this survey consolidates the state-of-the-art developments in C-NOMA and outlines future research directions, including AI-driven optimization, quantum-assisted communication, UAV and satellite integration, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled designs, and hybrid OMA-NOMA switching. By addressing these open challenges, C-NOMA is expected to serve as a cornerstone for secure, energy-efficient, and ultra-reliable connectivity in 6G and beyond, enabling massive IoT, autonomous systems, and next-generation smart city infrastructures."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the design of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under conditions of imperfect channel state information (CSI). It leverages rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to maximize the system's sum rate. The optimization problem, which involves the joint design of RSMA precoders, power allocation, and phase optimization for the active RIS, is highly non-convex and presents significant computational challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes the problem into two subproblems. The RSMA precoders and power allocation are optimized using semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and the concave-convex procedure (CCCP), while the phase optimization for the active RIS is approached through the auxiliary variable method combined with the difference of convex (DC) functions technique. Simulation results across various scenarios, including power budgets, antenna configurations, and channel errors, confirm that the proposed RSMA-active RIS system significantly outperforms traditional multiple access methods. The results underscore its resilience to imperfect CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) and the receiver (CSIR), highlighting its potential for practical applications in achieving enhanced sum rate performance."

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) learns detectors with only image-level classification annotations. Without precise instance-level labels, most previous WSOD methods in remote sensing images (RSIs) select the highest-scoring proposals as the final detection results, which are confronted by two major challenges: (1) instances with small scale or rare poses are easily neglected; (2) optimizing network by the top-scoring region inevitably overlooks many valuable candidate proposals. To mitigate the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a data-driven bidirectional spatial-adaptive network (BSANet). It contains a forward-reverse spatial dropout (FRSD) module to reduce instance ambiguity induced from extreme scales and poses, as well as crowded scene, and to better excavate the entire instances. From attention learning perspective, the proposed FRSD is conceptually similar to a data-driven hard attention mechanism, which adaptively samples and reconstructs the spatially related regions for mining more latent feature responses. Meanwhile, our FRSD effectively alleviates the inherent problem that non-parametric hard attention learning fashion cannot adapt to different datasets. In addition, we build a soft attention branch to simultaneously model soft pixel-level and hard region-level attention information for exploring the complementary benefit between soft and hard attention learning. We evaluate our BSANet on the challenging NWPU VHR-10.v2 and DIOR datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "In ice-infested waters, the complexity of background makes it challenging to accurately detect ship targets using only visible (VIS) remote sensing images. To address this challenge, we introduce short-wave infrared (SWIR) images to enhance target visibility and propose a joint network for ship detection in ice-infested waters using both VIS and SWIR images, termed IceShipvsNet. The joint detection backbone of this network is implemented using C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>Former, which is known for its strong performance in multi-modal feature learning. To improve the multimodal feature extraction, we introduce a spectral frequency augmentation (SFA) module, which adaptively enhances or suppresses high-frequency features from VIS and SWIR images to improve target response and suppress background interference. Specifically, the SFA module incorporates two components: Frequency-Aware Modulation for VIS (FAM-VI), which regulates high-frequency noise in VIS images and enhances ship characteristics; SWIR High-Frequency Guided Attention (FGA-S), which boosts the high-frequency information in SWIR images and suppresses irrelevant background noise. Given the lack of publicly available datasets for ship detection in ice-infested waters, we construct a VIS-SWIR dataset (VS-IceShip) and use it for experimental evaluation. The results demonstrate that IceShipvsNet achieves superior detection accuracy compared to single-modal baselines on various detectors. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SFA, with both FAM-VI and FGA-S contributing significantly to performance improvement."

    "abstract": "Neural text-to-speech (TTS) research has advanced significantly, yielding various approaches that generate speech with enhanced naturalness. Despite these strides, synthesizing expressive speech remains a significant challenge due to the complex and variable nature of explicit human prosody. In this paper, we presented an effective TTS approach that transfers expressivity from a reference speech to a target spoken text. The proposed approach, Robust Fine-Grained Expressivity Transfer with Transformer, RFGETT-TTS, extends and enhances the Transformer-based text-to-speech architecture to enable transfer of expressivity from a reference utterance to synthesized speech. Key components of RFGETT-TTS include: (1) a prosody extraction module that aligns prosodic features with phoneme inputs, providing stable prosodic representations to the NTTS system, (2) an expressivity aggregation module that encodes and fuses expressive characteristics into a single expressive vector using convolutional layers and normalization, (3) a Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism that aligns and integrates linguistic inputs with expressivity features derived from the reference utterance, and (4) the speaker module that encodes speaker identity representation. The Transformer encoder's output is then fused with speaker embeddings and used to condition the Transformer decoder. Extensive evaluations on ESD and EmoV-DB datasets demonstrate that RFGETT-TTS outperforms four TTS models in expressivity transfer while maintaining high-quality of synthesized speech, validated by both objective and subjective evaluation metrics. Objective metric like Mel Cepstral Distortion shows that RFGETT-TTS achieves better than four models with a gap up to 0.18, while statistical subjective results on Expressivity Mean Opinion Score show significant difference (p-value < 0.05) than four models."

Firstly, a dynamic adaptive event-triggered consensus protocol is designed, in which the gain of the matrix weights in the graph is adjusted by introducing adaptive coupling weights. Then, by applying Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are established to ensure bipartite consensus of linear leader-following multi-agent systems under matrix weights.

    "abstract": "Annotated datasets are critical for training high-performance audio models, yet manual annotation remains labor-intensive and costly. While Active Learning (AL) is proposed to annotate samples selectively to maximize model performance, most existing approaches are based on the pre-defined set of categories, called the fixed-set paradigm. This fixed label set cannot effectively address the dynamic annotation needed in the expanding-set paradigm, where new sound classes emerge over time. To bridge this gap, this work reframes audio annotation as a domain adaptation process to unify these two paradigms and resolves them by a general framework. Unlike traditional AL methods that rely on a single indicator, this work proposes a Multi-Indicator Active Learning Framework (MIAF) that integrates multiple indicators, to meet different needs of fixed-set and expanding-set paradigms. The MIAF introduces a novel indicator, Domain Shift Impact (DSI), to minimize the distributional divergence between labeled data and the full dataset. Based on the DSI, the indicator of diversity is introduced to prevent information redundancy in a batch sampling, while incorporating indicators of density and outlierness as paradigm-specific indicators for fixed-set and expanding-set scenarios, respectively. To integrate these indicators, a region-based sample selection strategy is proposed to separate the feature space into several regions depending on density or outlierness, while regions with higher DSI value are prioritized, with one sample selected from each region to ensure diversity. Experiments on four diverse audio datasets demonstrate that MIAF consistently outperforms existing AL methods across different paradigms and dataset sizes. Ablation studies further validate the complementary roles of the proposed indicators and the generalization capacity of MIAF."

    "abstract": "This work presents an iterative design methodology based on the equivalent mathematical model of a resonant converter for in-Wheel dynamic IPT applications. This design methodology considers the magnetic coupling dimensions as well as the resonant circuit parameters that achieve resonant operation and meet dynamic requirements. The system uses the wheel as an intermediary stage to transfer energy into the vehicle, using two magnetic couplers (MC), maintaining a minimal air gap throughout the energy transfer process. The first MC transfers power from the off-board transmitters to the receiver in the wheel and the second MC transfers the power from the wheel to the EV. The design methodology ensures load independent transconductance gain from a double coupling LCC-S-S resonant converter. In this way, the proposed system offers a low cost solution using a open-loop control and without feedback requirements from the vehicle. The iterative design methodology combines the self and mutual inductance values and coupling factor profiles of both MCs, obtained from a finite element analysis (FEA) tool, taking into consideration the system specifications and constraints to find all possible solutions. A set of selection metrics are then proposed to identify the optimal solution. An experimental prototype was built to validate the safe operation under full range operating conditions in dynamic applications. An overall DC-DC efficiency of approximately 78% when transferring 2 kW to the load was achieved. In dynamic operation and, considering one transmitter pad, a maximum energy transfer of 27 Wh is achieved when moving at a speed of 30 m/h."

    "abstract": "A vast number of studies on knowledge graph embedding have been conducted. However, most knowledge graph embedding models have high dimensional embedding vectors. To use the models in embedded systems such as mobile devices or robots, we need to reduce the size of the embedding models. Although there are several approaches to handle the lightweight knowledge graph embedding problem, the existing approaches have drawbacks while processing actual tasks (i.e., queries). For instance, to process queries in the embedded systems, they require a full scan of the entity embedding vectors. To overcome the drawbacks, we propose a lightweight knowledge graph embedding framework, called QLite, to simultaneously consider three factors: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Model Accuracy, Model Space</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Query Processing Time</i>. QLite provides simple methods to effectively reduce the models’ size without decoding. Moreover, QLite adopts a reordering module to avoid the full linear scan of the entities during query processing. We focus on TransE to show if the reordering module is effective. Finally, we experimentally show the efficiency and the effectiveness of QLite."

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies explicitly focusing on mandibular defect segmentation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria distinguished defect-oriented research from studies limited to regular mandibular segmentation. The review analysed dataset availability, methodological approaches, and clinical integration strategies. Only a few studies directly examined defect segmentation, with most datasets dominated by typical mandibular structures. Some datasets offered subunit-level separation enabling defect simulation. Existing models showed promising performance in typical cases but lacked generalisability when applied to defect conditions or across institutions. Barriers include scarce annotated defect datasets, high computational demands of 3D models, and variability in imaging protocols. Opportunities lie in domain adaptation, multi-centre data utilisation, and defect simulation. Practical integration requires streamlined pipelines, intuitive correction tools, and 3D visualisation to support implant planning, fibular free flap reconstruction, and surgical simulation."

DoS attacks can disrupt communication channels, causing unexpected changes in the network topology that may prevent controllers from receiving crucial information, degrading control performance. A security architecture based on Acknowledgment signal (ACK) for attack detection and topology recovery is created. Based on this architecture, a secondary control strategy of MG under DETM is proposed, which can solve the contradiction between voltage regulation and reactive power sharing in the case of DoS attack, achieve accurate reactive power sharing, reduce the deviation between voltage amplitude and standard value, and realize frequency recovery and active power sharing. The stability of the proposed control strategy is established through the application of Lyapunov's theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified through the utilization of an islanded MG simulation system built in MATLAB/Simulink and a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test platform."

    "abstract": "Accurate mapping of permafrost landforms, thaw disturbances, and human-built infrastructure at pan-Arctic scale using sub-meter resolution satellite imagery is increasingly critical. Handling petabyte-scale image data requires high performance computing and robust feature detection models. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely used for remote sensing (RS), Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms, similar to the success in transformer-based large language models. ViTs support pretraining via self-supervised learning, addressing the common limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection, and outperform CNNs on benchmark datasets. The Arctic domain also poses challenges for model generalization, especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as feature extractors for high resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks and (2) the benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three tasks—detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with location embeddings significantly improve RTS (F1 from 0.84 to 0.92) and IWP (mAP50 from 0.49 to 0.57), while the CNN baseline remains moderately stronger on Infrastructure (F1 0.88 vs. 0.86); all per-task differences are significant at the 95% confidence level. This demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS applications."

However, the escalating complexity of ANC algorithms and the inherent variability of real-world testing conditions frequently lead to excessive experimental costs and inefficiencies, significantly impeding the broader implementation of in-vehicle ANC systems. This challenge underscores a significant deficiency in the field: the absence of high-fidelity approach to facilitate the validation of algorithms under reproducible conditions. This paper introduces a sound field reproduction (SFR) method based on the multi-channel pressure matching least squares (MCPMLS) algorithm for in-vehicle ANC system evaluation. The SFR-ANC system is further proposed, integrating a feedback-equalization-optimized SFR subsystem with dual parallel ANC subsystems powered by broadband and narrowband adaptive algorithms. The hybrid system was implemented through a loudspeaker array and active headrest integration, design to achieve accurate in-vehicle sound environment reproduction and localized cancellation. The system’s performance was evaluated using ear zone noise collected inside a real vehicle as disturbance signals within an acoustic laboratory. Experimental results validate the system’s accuracy in reproducing authentic noise environments and the noise cancelling performances both in stable and transient conditions. The proposed approach establishes a reproducible testing protocol for standardized subjective-objective assessment of in-vehicle ANC performance."

Although recent 3D Gaussians offer efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis, directly embedding language features in them leads to prohibitive memory usage and decreased performance. In this work, we introduce Language Embedded 3D Gaussians, a novel scene representation for open-vocabulary query tasks. Instead of embedding high-dimensional raw semantic features on 3D Gaussians, we propose a dedicated quantization scheme that drastically alleviates the memory requirement, and a novel embedding procedure that achieves smoother yet high accuracy query, countering the multi-view feature inconsistencies and the high-frequency inductive bias in point-based representations. Our comprehensive experiments show that our representation achieves the best visual quality and language querying accuracy across current language embedded representations, while maintaining real-time rendering frame rates on a single desktop GPU."

    "abstract": "Although haptic technologies that allow users to touch virtual objects have been actively researched in the academic field of haptics, they are not yet widely adopted in real-world applications. To promote broader adoption, designing haptic stimuli that elicit pleasant sensations is essential since hedonic motivation significantly drives user acceptance. However, how such pleasantness can be effectively induced through haptic stimulation during a user's active exploration remains an open question. Furthermore, it is unclear whether “pseudo-haptics”, a low-cost substitute for physical force feedback, can also serve effectively in this affective context. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the applied force during user actions and the resulting pleasantness, using a bow-dragging and arrow-shooting scenario as a case study. Specifically, we conducted three psychophysical experiments to investigate two types of force feedback. One type was a physical force that stimulated the kinesthetic sense, and the other was a pseudo force induced through visual manipulation. Our results revealed that pleasantness tended to be elicited when physical resistance force was present during bow dragging, whereas this tendency was not observed for pseudo resistance force. While there has been a general assumption that pseudo-haptics can replace physical stimuli to some extent in the rendering of haptic properties, our findings quantitatively show that in our case the two are not interchangeable for eliciting positive affect. We also found that the arrow's flying speed contributed to pleasantness as much as the physical resistance force, suggesting that pleasantness is influenced postdictively. Moreover, across all experiments, perceived pleasantness was strongly correlated with the perceived naturalness of the bow-and-arrow behavior. These findings provide valuable insights for designing pleasant interactions involving continuous force feedback, highlighting the distinct roles of physical and pseudo-haptic cues."

    "abstract": "Keyword spotting (KWS) requires efficient recognition with minimal resources, posing challenges in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a customized KWS Framework based on Triplet Contrastive Learning Pretraining (TCLP-KWS). The framework follows a two-stage training pipeline. In the pretraining stage, lightweight speech and query encoders are trained on large-scale public speech datasets to capture robust speech-phoneme relationships. By utilizing phrase-level data instead of full sentences, TCLP-KWS accelerates training and enhances fine-grained recognition of short expressions. In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained encoders are integrated with a self-attention-based feature extraction module and classifier, optimizing performance on keyword recognition tasks. Additionally, triplet contrastive learning is employed to align and extract features from both audio and phoneme modalities. TCLP-KWS incorporates intra-modal contrastive learning, which automatically generates hard negative pairs. This strategy improves robustness on challenging keyword distinctions, further enhancing recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in achieving high-performance keyword spotting with minimal resource requirements."

    "abstract": "In electromagnetic countermeasures circumstances, modulated interrupted sampling repeated jamming (ISRJ) can seriously degrade the imaging quality of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Modulated ISRJ typically exhibits characteristics such as high coherence, time variability, fast modulation with short slices, and limited bandwidth dispersion. This paper develops a modulated ISRJ suppression method that integrates morphological component analysis (MCA) assisted by deep learning jamming parameters estimation. In the method, the YOLO model is employed to detect on the time-frequency distribution diagram of the echo signal, accurately localizing the jamming's time-frequency boundaries. Based on these estimation parameters, the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) dictionary is dynamically optimized by matching time-frequency formation of ISRJ segment so that the jamming can be completely focused at the stage of jamming suppression. Finally, a dual-dictionary model is constructed using MCA based on the time-frequency differences between the target signal and the jamming signal. Based on this MCA model, an integrating the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) is proposed to jointly optimize the sparse representation of jamming and signal. This method can effectively suppress modulated ISRJ and exhibits good performance under different jamming-to-signal ratio (JSR). Finally, both simulation experiments and measured SAR data have verified that its performance in suppressing modulated ISRJ is superior to that of traditional methods."

Currently, there are many effective approaches to error correction in QKD. However, most of them, due to their generic nature, fail to leverage the specific features of particular protocol implementations. This work demonstrates that accounting for the hardware specifics of a QKD system implementing the time-bin protocol enables a significant increase in error correction performance. For the considered QKD system, we have experimentally obtained estimates of the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) observed for each combination of bit and detector. The differences in the obtained estimates reveal that the quantum channel can be modeled as a non-uniform binary channel. Furthermore, based on computational experiments with a model of the quantum channel, it was established that adapting the error correction procedure to its properties can achieve up to a 2.7-fold reduction in the LDPC code decoding failure rate at low error levels."

    "abstract": "Due to the rising penetration of distributed energy resources and electric vehicles charging stations, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are facing higher challenges to effectively manage low voltage (LV) grids. To enhance their voltage magnitudes’ real-time monitoring, distribution system state estimators (DSSEs) are the targeted solution. However, the application of conventional techniques for state estimation to LV grids is challenged by their unbalanced nature and the limited access to real-time measurements, while on the other hand state estimators (SEs) based on classical machine learning techniques are limited by a lack of knowledge of the physical aspect of the electrical systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) based LV DSSE using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The proposed SE incorporates information about the grid’s topology and parameters while proposing a three-phase four-wire graph representation suitable for LV grids characteristics. Moreover, an unsupervised training is proposed with the aim of training the model in respect to the physical equations, among which the power flow equations. Tests are conducted on various grids generated from open data and evaluate the performance of the GNN-based SE while comparing it to classical machine learning based techniques as autoencoders (AE). The generalizability of the proposed SE in terms of training on a subset of grids and applying to others is investigated."

While several resource allocation frameworks have been proposed, selecting the optimal allocation strategy remains challenging due to the time-consuming nature of naïve and optimization-based methods. This research introduces a meta-learning framework to automatically select the most suitable resource allocation strategy based on system's characteristics. The approach models system vulnerabilities using attack graphs and benchmarks multiple graph-theoretic allocation strategies based on asset ranking. Node features are extracted using Random Walks (RWs) with negative sampling and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). A tabular dataset is constructed using these features and labeled with the optimal allocation strategy. Ten classifiers are trained to predict the best strategy for unseen data. The framework is validated on both real-world and synthetic graphs, outperforming five baselines (including ARGOSMART, ISAC, and Global Best) in security improvement. Using RWs embeddings, our framework outperforms four graph neural network baselines, achieving the highest mean rank. Our model improves security by 42.10% under uniform investments and 43.79% under random investment. We also show that reducing embedding size from 256 to 64 increases security gains.

However, the 12-day Sentinel-1A repeat is insufficient to identify all events. The ICEYE constellation can capture dense time series. When ICEYE coherence products were created using images acquired a day apart, the timing of tillage could be determined with precision.

This article proposes a new single-stage CGSC-TL nine-level (9 L) multilevel inverter (MLI) with voltage-boosting capability and limited spikes of charging current of the capacitor, designed to be employed as a single-stage power-electronics-based interface device between renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) systems and power grid and/or load. The proposed MLI provides several merits, such as a common-ground structure that suppresses PV-to-ground leakage current associated with PV parasitic capacitances, active and reactive power support, a wide input voltage range, and higher output voltage levels (9 L) compared with other structures in the same class. Comprehensive comparative analyses, as well as simulation and experimental results, are presented to verify the performance of the proposed inverter."

    "abstract": "Accurate velocity estimation during the stance phase is critical for minimizing drift in foot-mounted inertial navigation systems (INS). Traditional Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) methods, however, rely on the idealized assumption of zero foot velocity during stance. In practice, residual motion arises from foot rotation about a fixed contact point (CP), introducing systematic errors when zero velocity is enforced. Prior Non-ZUPT (N-ZUPT) approaches estimated stance velocities using empirical templates, gait-specific models, or adaptive covariance tuning - often requiring motion-dependent calibration or shoe-based modeling. In contrast, this work derives a closed-form analytical kinematic constraint based solely on foot rotation about a fixed CP and a known IMU-to-CP lever arm, enabling direct non-zero stance velocity estimation without gait modeling, data training, or adaptive heuristics. The proposed N-ZUPT formulation is validated through (i) a physics-based inverted-pendulum pedestrian simulation with multiple IMU placements, (ii) real-world experiments under two conditions: (1) closed-loop in-plane walking/running trajectories (71 m) and (2) trajectories (92 m) inducing out-of-plane motion (ladder ascent/descent). The method achieves up to 3.1× reduction in mean 3D RMSE, (6.3× improvement vertically) for in-plane motion and (4.5× improvement vertically), during ladder experiments, demonstrating robust performance across both planar and vertical dynamics."

    "abstract": "Vibration mitigation in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) is critical for ensuring structural safety and operational efficiency. This paper proposes a novel self-powered active mass damper (SPAMD) system based on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) for FOWT vibration control. The SPAMD integrates a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) with an electromagnetic energy-harvesting damper, enabling simultaneous vibration suppression and energy regeneration. An economic model predictive control (EMPC) based on a simplified barge-type offshore wind turbine model is presented to optimize the energy recovery of the electromagnetic damper. Therein, the bounded states of the error subsystem are selected as the constraints of the proposed EMPC strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed EMPC controller is verified through real-time simulations on a dSPACE platform."

A specific limitation is the difficulty of detecting intrusions and estimating the intensity of attacks in resource-constrained environments, such as access networks with IoT devices. This article proposes a modular framework that encodes network flows into fixed-size Bloom Filter matrices, enabling scalable and efficient learning through different modeling strategies. The methodology was validated using real traffic collected from a Brazilian broadband network, and three approaches were tested: a baseline linear predictor, an ensemble based on XGBoost, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The linear model showed limited performance, with an R-squared of 0.0233, while the ensemble improved results, reaching an F1-score of 0.9790 and an R-squared of 0.3897. CNN achieved the highest overall performance, with near-perfect classification metrics, including an accuracy of 0.9965 and an F1-score of 0.9972, as well as a strong regression accuracy with an R-squared of 0.8260 and a mean absolute error of 0.0789.

    "abstract": "Trajectory planning is crucial for ensuring the safety of intelligent vehicles (IVs) in autonomous driving, especially in complex traffic environments where perception and control uncertainties increase collision risks. Existing risk-aware planning methods often fail to capture the full scope of uncertainties through risk assessment and struggle to consistently integrate risk information throughout the trajectory generation process. Risk factors are often overshadowed by smoothness and dynamic feasibility considerations, leading to excessively high-risk trajectories that fail to meet human driving expectations for caution. To address these challenges, we propose a cognitive risk-aware hierarchical trajectory planning method that adaptively regulates driving caution based on cognitive risk. We introduce cognitive risk assessment using two fields: the anisotropic objective risk field, which accounts for the size and comprehensive motion uncertainty of surrounding obstacles, and the driving cognition field, which considers the IV motion trends and reflects its proactive cognition of objective risks. By fusing these fields, we calculate cognitive risk and incorporate it into a planning framework that combines trajectory search and optimization. By explicitly considering cognitive risk constraints in both stages, the method achieves complete cognitive risk awareness, generating adaptive, safe, and dynamically feasible smooth trajectories. Experimental results in various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. By incorporating cognitive risk assessment, the IV exhibits more cautious driving behavior, aligning with human expectations. Compared to three state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the minimum time-to-collision by over 20%, reduces lane-crossing time by more than 10%, and decreases the average yaw rate by over 12%. In summary, the proposed method ensures higher safety, improves lane-changing efficiency and smoothness."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the voltage control and dynamic performance optimization of inverter-based distributed generation units in islanded microgrids. To tackle practical challenges such as system dynamic constraints, nonlinear characteristics, uncertain actuator faults, and limited communication resources, a distributed cooperative control strategy based on a multi-agent system is proposed. First, to strictly constrain the consensus error in the distributed control system, a barrier function configured with a hyperbolic sine function is designed. This ensures that the consensus error satisfies the preset performance constraints, thereby improving the controllability of the system's dynamic evolution. Second, to address potential unknown actuator faults such as partial failure and bias misalignment, a second-order dynamic compensation signal is constructed and combined with an adaptive law to achieve real-time online estimation and rapid compensation of fault parameters. This significantly enhances the system's fault tolerance and robustness. Finally, to reduce the communication burden in the distributed control system and effectively suppress grid harmonics and oscillations caused by abrupt changes in control commands, an event-triggered control mechanism with a decreasing threshold characteristic is introduced, saving communication resources for the microgrid. Theoretical analysis and simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and medical image processing technologies, automated intelligent diagnostic algorithms based on spinal X-ray images have been continuously developed. However, current deep learning–based diagnostic methods for spinal diseases face limitations such as the limited availability of labeled data and subtle inter-class feature differences. To address these challenges in spinal X-ray image diagnosis, this study proposes a novel Siamese Swin Transformer model based on transfer learning, within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework—referred to as the SpineSiamSwin model. The model adopts a Siamese network structure and leverages metric learning loss functions to maximize the distance between different classes in the embedding space, thereby enhancing the model’s sensitivity to subtle structural differences between disease categories. Extensive experiments on real-world spinal X-ray datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the SpineSiamSwin model."

Though the light sampling approach improves the accuracy, it yields a trade-off between the number of light samples and the precision. In this paper, we propose a photometric stereo method to estimate the surface normals of an object using planar lights installed near the object, which is rather practical. Our multiple planar light model allows planar light to have different light intensities and near objects. We leverage the closed form of the shading equation of planar lights to build the linear equation that constrains surface normals by photometric observations. We compare our method with other physical-based approaches in the synthetic sets and demonstrate its performance in terms of accuracy and precision. We also test our method in in-the-wild scenarios."

While the performance of the coil under liquid helium and nitrogen environments has been previously established, this study explores its behavior under conduction cooling using a large test cryostat at The Ohio State University. The magnet, measuring 613 mm in length and weighing ∼75 kg, consists of four helical layers wound with ReBCO-based CORC wire and was thermally anchored to a copper cold ring supported by a G-10 strongback. Cooling was provided by two Sumitomo RDK-415D cryocoolers, offering a combined 3 W at 4.2 K and 150 W at 77 K. Multiple thermal cycles were performed, with cooldown durations of up to 45 hours. Final base temperatures of approximately 10.8 K (at the coil edge) and 12.0 K (at the coil center) were achieved, with an axial temperature difference of approximately 1.2 K. The warm-up period extended over approximately 24.6 hours. Voltage measurements from all four layers were recorded during cooldown and warmup. The system demonstrated stable cooldown performance, repeatable gradients, and good thermal anchoring. These results support the feasibility of conduction cooling in large-scale HTS magnets, aligning with broader goals for “green” cryogen-free accelerator technologies and paving the way for more sustainable, scalable, and energy-efficient high-field magnet systems in next-generation particle accelerators."

Traditional automation techniques—such as rule-based logic or bespoke machine learning pipelines—struggle with adaptability and explainability in dynamic environments. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), however, have introduced new opportunities for autonomous, intent-driven infrastructure control. In this work, we present a closed-loop framework that integrates LLM agents for automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and mitigation of faults within cloud-edge and IoT systems. When SLA violations are detected, the agent identifies likely root causes and selects corrective actions—such as pod rescheduling, scaling, or configuration updates—executed via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposing management tool functionalities through an API. This RCA-plus-mitigation loop enables fault handling that is both explainable and adaptive. We evaluate our system on a cluster running synthetic IoT workloads under emulated stressors using a reproducible benchmarking setup. Results show that the agent identifies SLA violations with 52.9% accuracy and mitigates 70.7% of them successfully. Notably, the agent incorporates validation steps to ensure system stability after interventions. These findings highlight the feasibility of LLMs for real-time infrastructure healing and their potential role in future AIOps workflows."

Departing from prior binary fidget representations, our approach leverages the bandwidth of the received signal as a finer-grained and robust indicator of crowd counts. More specifically, we propose a mathematical model that relates the probability density function (PDF) of the signal bandwidth to the crowd size, using a principled derivation based on the PDF of an individual's fidget-induced bandwidth. To characterize the individual fidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated individual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques, followed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from analog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world deployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an anomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our system through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes up to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a normalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51 seconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state of the art. Additional simulation results demonstrate scalability to larger crowd sizes. Overall, our results showcase that the proposed pipeline enables fast, robust, and highly accurate counting of seated crowds."

In this letter, we develop a novel multi-bit decision-based BMA (MBD-BMA) for trace reconstruction.

The bit is then reconstructed by using the minimum-weight branch. Simulation results show that the Levenshtein error rate of the proposed MBD-BMA is significantly lower than that of BMA, while the increased complexity of MBD-BMA is relatively low."

The main challenges in solving this problem stem from the presence of actuator attacks and the dimensionality mismatch of the error signals caused by the dynamic entry and exit of followers. To address such challenges, a novel analytical method is developed to characterize the error evolution at switching instants via switching-instant error-coupling inequalities, which describe how error signals evolve in response to changes in the number of followers. Based on this method, a full-order attack-free state observer is designed to estimate the states of each follower without estimating the exact value of the attack. In addition, a reduced-order attack-free observer is developed to reduce the estimation burden and computational complexity, while still ensuring the effective estimation of the states. Building on the observer architectures, both full-order and reduced-order observer-based distributed resilient control protocols are proposed to achieve output consensus tracking while ensuring the tracking error remains uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) for heterogeneous oMAS under actuator attacks, by employing the output regulation approach. The effectiveness of both types of control protocols is demonstrated through numerical simulation."

Although recent studies have made progress in either multimodal or controllable motion behavior generation, it remains a major challenge to simultaneously generate multimodal motion behaviors in a controllable manner. In this work, we propose a unified framework, CoMoGen, to generate multimodal motion behaviors in a controllable manner under open-loop evaluation assumption. The proposed framework consists of three core components: i) a learning-based vehicle placer, responsible for positioning generated vehicles in non-conflicting initial locations; ii) a robust model-based trajectory candidate generator, capable of synthesizing controllable and multimodal trajectory candidates. iii) a learning-based trajectory selector, developed to evaluate and select multimodal trajectories for the placed vehicles. Experiments on the INTERACTION dataset demonstrate strong controllability and multimodality of CoMoGen. Further experiments on three additional real-world datasets, that are unseen during training, as well as on diverse synthesized high-definition maps, validate the remarkable generalization capability of CoMoGen."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a wideband millimeter-wave (mmW) endfire circularly polarized (CP) antenna intensified by a metasurface to improve performance. The antenna element integrates a pair of horizontal electric dipoles with two vertically oriented substrates, simultaneously exciting two orthogonal electric-field components. Additionally, two diamond-shaped metasurface arrays are embedded into the substrates to optimize the amplitude and phase balance between the horizontal and vertical components. This configuration not only broadens the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth but also optimizes the impedance matching, and helps to reduce the profile. To further increase the gain, a linear 1 × 8 endfire CP antenna array has been designed and fabricated. The entire structure is manufactured using printed circuit board (PCB) technology. Measured results demonstrate a –10-dB impedance bandwidth of 35.52%, a 3-dB AR bandwidth of 34.69%, and a peak gain of 16.2 dBi. The combination of the competitive performance and compact profile makes the proposed endfire CP antenna array a promising candidate for wideband mmW applications."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 5G have empowered edge devices to generate high-quality data, driving the need for Federated Learning (FL), which enables privacy-preserving model training at the edge (e.g., hospitals) without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL remains vulnerable to poisoning attacks and relies on an overburdened central server. Moreover, the lack of transparent explanations for poisoner elimination raises concerns about model reliability, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare. This article proposes a novel hyperledger-based hierarchical FL scheme called X-BDFL (Explainable blockchain-enabled distributed federated learning) against poisoning attack in healthcare that ensures explainable and verifiable poisoner detection and elimination scheme without exposing sensitive model parameters. The hierarchical FL structure builds trust by filtering unintended anomalies at the edge to protect client reputation and detecting poisoners at the fog for early mitigation and reduced server overhead. The poisoner detection scheme leverages Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)-based behaviour analysis of client models to justify threat elimination through feature attribution. The novelty of this scheme is its use of JS-Divergence to detect out-of-order malicious clients without assuming any prior data distribution, and maintaining effectiveness even when most participants are compromised. Furthermore, our scheme offers transparent, scalable defence while preserving model integrity without adding overhead to edge medical devices. Experimental results shows that X-BDFL counters label-flipping and backdoor attacks with low success rates of 4% and 9% under 90% poisoning, while preserving task accuracy. It achieves comparable defence accuracy on MINIST dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art method (MOAT [9]) by 28% on complex dataset like COVID-QU-Ex."

Experiments on multiple real datasets, including Amazon-MR, ACM-MR, and DBLP-MR, demonstrate that RSA-HGNN4Rec significantly outperforms mainstream baseline models in terms of Recall@20 and NDCG@20 metrics for product recommendation tasks, while also demonstrating excellent generalization ability and interpretability on node classification tasks."

In contrast to that, this paper presents an Inter-Defender Collision-Aware Interception Strategy (IDCAIS) for defenders to intercept attackers in order to defend a protected area, such that the defender-to-attacker assignment protocol not only takes into account an interception-related cost but also takes into account any possible future collisions among the defenders on their optimal interception trajectories. In particular, in this paper, the defenders are assigned to intercept attackers using a mixed- integer quadratic program (MIQP) that: 1) minimizes the sum of times taken by defenders to capture the attackers under time-optimal control, as well as 2) helps eliminate or delay possible future collisions among the defenders on the optimal trajectories. To prevent inevitable collisions on optimal trajectories or collisions arising due to time-sub-optimal behavior by the attackers, a minimally augmented control using exponential control barrier function (ECBF) is also provided. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach."

    "abstract": "The detection of silent failures in optical networks is inherently difficult, and their presence may jeopardize network reliability and operational efficiency, particularly as these networks scale to meet increasing bandwidth demands. Among the most elusive silent failure types are forwarding errors in wavelength selective switches (WSSs), which may misroute optical signals without triggering alarms, leading to prolonged service interruptions. In this work, we propose a novel failure detection and localization framework that leverages the distributed chromatic dispersion (CD) profile of the signal path using longitudinal power profile estimation (PPE) technique. PPE enables span-by-span reconstruction of the lightpath’s optical characteristics with resolution of a few tens of ps/nm for typical coherent signals, allowing for precise estimation of CD accumulation at each segment. By comparing the measured distributed CD profile against a topology-aware digital twin of the network, discrepancies caused by forwarding errors at specific WSS nodes are unambiguously identified and localized. Our method bypasses the limitation of total CD estimation and enhances fault localization resolution as validated by the experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of silent failure identification and localization in optical networks based on PPE."

    "abstract": "Integrating reinforcement learning to align generated speech with human preferences has proven effective in improving the robustness of language model-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Current approaches primarily rely on preference data annotated at the utterance level. However, frequent issues affecting the listening experience, such as unnatural prosody, mispronunciations, or semantic inconsistencies, often arise only in specific segments of audio, while other segments may be well-generated and require no correction. This mismatch between coarse-grained supervision and fine-grained quality variation limits the effectiveness of preference-based optimization. In this study, we propose a fine-grained preference optimization approach (FPO) to enhance the robustness of TTS systems. FPO shifts the optimization paradigm from global utterance-level tuning to targeted local refinement, focusing on addressing localized issues in generated samples rather than uniformly optimizing the entire utterance. We begin by analyzing the types of common generation issues and categorizing them into temporal modeling errors and semantic-phonetic alignment errors, which frequently degrade intelligibility and naturalness. To tackle these problems, we introduce a selective training loss strategy that leverages fine-grained labels for each issue type, allowing the model to focus on learning signals where they are most needed. Experimental results demonstrate that FPO substantially improves the robustness of zero-shot TTS systems by effectively correcting problematic regions in the output. This leads to a significant reduction in the bad case ratio, improved intelligibility, and overall perceptual quality. Moreover, FPO exhibits strong data efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance to baseline methods while requiring notably fewer training samples.

Since the phase unwrapping is ill-posed, a prior deformation model is required to decrease the phase gradient. However, the use of prior deformation model will significantly decrease the success rate of phase unwrapping, especially for non-linear deformation. In this work, the recursive 3D phase unwrapping with the assumption of weak prior deformation model is proposed. The initial time series is unwrapped with the prior deformation model while the following time series is unwrapped by using the temporal smoothing constraint. The experimental results by both the simulated and real data demonstrate that the recursive 3D phase unwrapping has a better performance in non-linear deformation retrieval., which would be beneficial for identifying deformation risks."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely fossil fuel carbon emission data are crucial for achieving China’s “carbon peak” and netzero “carbon neutrality” (net-zero emissions) goals, as well as global climate targets. Traditional carbon emission inventories encounter challenges such as delayed updates and high costs, which underscores the importance of employing top-down observation methods, like satellite remote sensing, for efficient policy formulation. This study integrates satellite column concentration products, meteorological data, geographic information, and the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China(MEIC) emission inventory to estimate carbon emissions in China using four machine learning models: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The results demonstrate that LightGBM surpasses the other models in terms of spatial-temporal distribution and correlation with the MEIC inventory. Analysis of remote sensing input parameters indicates that combining column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) and nitrogen dioxide vertical column density (NO2 VCD) yields the most accurate results. For 2019, the model’s estimates exhibit a strong correlation with MEIC data (R2 = 0.97), featuring an average grid-scale absolute difference of -0.95 kiloton (kt), an RMSE of 740.93 kt, an nRMSE of 0.34 and an MAE of 368.46 kt. Notably, 62.55% of the relative differences fall within the range of [-30%, 30%]. Uncertainty analysis for 2020 reveals a final uncertainty of 26.90%, emphasizing the combined influence of model and MEIC inventory uncertainties on carbon emission estimates."

    "abstract": "Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) aims to identify problems, alleviate negative feelings, and offer emotional support responses. Cause-and-Effect relations reveal the underlying motivations and intentions of the interlocutors in a dialogue. Previous research in ESC has often neglected to model the causal relations, moreover, causal information also evolves dynamically, remaining consistent with the evolving semantics throughout the conversation. In this paper, we propose a directed graph-based method Causal-ESC, which models cause-and-effect relations in a structural graph and captures the causality dynamics with an adaptive message-passing pattern. Specifically, we aggregate semantics and causality information in a directed graph, where nodes and edges are equipped with high-dimension semantic and causal features, respectively. Subsequently, we capture the dynamics of causality by designing an adaptive message-passing mechanism with learnable high-dimensional edge features, named Ada-MP. Furthermore, to alleviate over-smoothing problems, we add an improved structure based on transformer with residual connection into the framework of the message-passing process. Experimental results on ESConv show that our method surpasses baselines on both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation metrics with a conspicuous improvement."

A hybrid DC circuit breaker (HCB) has emerged as a promising solution that synthesizes fast interruption speed of solid-state breakers with low on-state losses of mechanical circuit breakers. This work introduces a novel concept of current limiting HCB capable of clamping the fault current for a few hundred microseconds and providing time for protection coordination before fully interrupting the fault current. The proof-of-concept prototype is developed using a pair of series connected IGBTs, parallel to a mechanical switch to isolate the fault. This work carried out a successful current limiting function of 4.5 kA for 100 μs and subsequent current interruption within 180 μs with a fault inductance of 39 μH. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the selection of semiconductor devices, surge current conduction capability, and current turn off characteristics based on experimental evaluation of multiple commercially available packages. Thermal performance and viability aspects of clamping device are also analyzed to assess suitability for practical implementation."

    "abstract": "In extraterrestrial environments with limited prior information, the autonomous perception capability of rovers is crucial for exploration missions. Given the images captured by rover cameras, scene segmentation techniques can be utilized to accurately identify and localize hazardous terrain, thereby providing critical decision support for subsequent path planning. Mars, as a primary destination for numerous rover-led explorations, its landscape presents a disordered nature, leading to significant inter-class pixel uniformity that triggers misclassification challenges. Moreover, the diverse shapes, sizes, and distributions of Martian scenes exhibit considerable irregularities in the absence of human intervention, posing challenges for feature extraction and accurate scene understanding. In this paper, we propose a scene segmentation network that incorporates an enhanced atrous spatial pyramid pooling (EASPP) module and a context refinement module (ECRNet). The EASPP module captures sufficient local and global contextual information through successive dilated convolutions and a coordinate attention mechanism. On this basis, to distinguish homogeneous contextual information, context priors are utilized to model inter-class relationships across different scenes, thereby reducing misclassification issues. Additionally, boundary priors are introduced to extract multi-scale boundary information, guiding the aggregation of contextual information within the same class, thus improving the consistency of segmentation. Our proposed approach showcases superior performance across various datasets such as AI4Mars, MSL-seg, and our internally developed Zhurong dataset. By facilitating rover path planning, it guarantees efficient and secure exploration of the Martian terrain."

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task that is pivotal in understanding surface changes. Recently, change detection methods have advanced rapidly and attained impressive results, driven by deep learning technology. However, existing methods generally employ fusion modules with the same design for multi-level features, overlooking the inherent distinctions between low-level spatial features and deep-level semantic features generated by deep networks. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel change detection network, referred to as DACNet. This method introduces a divide-and-conquer fusion strategy designed to fuse multi-level features using different fusion strategies. Specifically, the widely used MobileNetV2 is employed within a dual-branch architecture to extract multi-level features from bi-temporal images. Subsequently, the proposed divide-and-conquer fusion strategy comprises two specialized modules: the change region localization module (CRLM) and the edge complementarity module (ECM), which are tailored to fuse deep-level semantic features and low-level spatial features, respectively. Additionally, to mitigate the unnecessary noise introduced by the conventional UNet architectures, attention gates are introduced into the UNet decoder to enhance the changed information and suppress background noises. Extensive experiments are conducted on three available change detection datasets: LEVIR-CD, Google-CD, and MSRS-CD. The proposed network achieved favorable results compared to the nine state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, improving the F1 score by 0.93%, 1.10%, and 0.81% on the LEVIR-CD, Google-CD, and MSRS-CD datasets, respectively.

It is desired that the large-capacity modular multilevel converter-based high-voltage direct current (MMC-HVDC) systems could provide inertia support for the receiving grids. However, current analysis mainly focuses on the inertia support of wind farms/photovoltaic plants integrated MMC-HVDC systems. This paper studied the inertia support of MMC-HVDC systems transmitting large-scale hydropower. Firstly, the inertia support capability of the MMC-HVDC system integrating hydropower is analyzed, considering the communication delay and the support strategies of different devices. Then, an inertia boost control scheme was proposed for the sending-end MMC, which maximizes the inertia support of the hydropower generator and MMC's capacitor energy. Furthermore, a method for assessing the inertia support performance of the MMC-HVDC system is proposed, which approximates the system's time-varying inertia as piecewise constants. Finally, simulations are performed in a two-terminal MMC-HVDC system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed analysis method and control strategy."

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of the occupation of Wi-Fi channels based on frame captures conducted in different environments. We analyze the data under several different perspectives related to channel occupation. Results indicate that the 2.4 GHz band is saturated, while the 5 GHz and (especially) the 6 GHz still have significant resources available.

    "abstract": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries, thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is defined by the covariance function, known as kernel. In the proposed GPR-based CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis function, Matérn, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed approach is evaluated across two channel models with three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with 50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of spectral efficiency relative to the benchmarks."

Simultaneously, a critic learning scheme is utilized to approximate the optimal H∞ performance function and to learn the online adaptive optimal control. Then, a novel learning algorithm is developed to update the critic neural network (NN) weights. The finite-time convergence of the learning algorithm is analyzed, and the stability of the controlled servo system is demonstrated.

    "abstract": "Distributed energy scheduling in residential microgrids faces challenges from renewable uncertainty and privacy constraints. While multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables decentralized coordination, classical MARL methods suffer from exponential growth in the joint state–action space, leading to high computational complexity and low sample efficiency. Moreover, centralized training paradigms often rely on shared representations, raising privacy concerns. In this article, we propose a multiagent distributional reinforcement learning framework with the dynamic hyper policy network (DHPN), which constructs permutation-invariant (PI) representations via entitywise dynamic weight generation and multihead attention, reducing input redundancy and obviating the need for full joint information. To capture stochasticity from renewable variability and demand, we further introduce a distributional value function factorization framework to model return distributions, leveraging quantile regression and mean–shape decomposition. Experiments on a data-driven microgrid demonstrate that the DHPN outperforms strong baselines by achieving substantially lower mean-square error in representational evaluation and higher cumulative rewards, while exhibiting faster convergence, enhanced training stability, and reduced grid fluctuations. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining PI representations with distributional value modeling for scalable privacy-aware multiagent energy management."

    "abstract": "Parallel interleaved three-level (3L) inverters (PITI) are widely adopted in flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) for rail transit applications due to their ability to enhance power capacity and output quality. However, inherent neutral-point potential (NPP) fluctuations and zero-sequence circulating currents (ZSCC) in PITI can severely degrade harmonic quality and system performance. To coordinately address these issues, a carrier-based NPP balancing modulation scheme with ZSCC and common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction is proposed. Firstly, the multiple zero-sequence voltage injection modes that clamp the reference signal are introduced, where each mode offers distinct recovery capabilities under various NPP conditions. Then, leveraging the redundancy of interleaved carriers, all the candidate injection modes are coordinated with a specific carrier swapping algorithm for non-clamping phase to limit the ZSCC slope. Additionally, within the integrated five-level plane, modes with high CMV are eliminated in each subsector, further refining the selection process. Finally, a mode deployment criterion is established based on real-time NPP conditions, enabling the injection of corresponding voltage components into the reference signal to suppress NPP fluctuations while simultaneously mitigating ZSCC and CMV. Comparative simulations and experiments on a 300-kW PITI-fed FESS motor are conducted to validate the proposed scheme."

In this paper, we show how learning malware detectors can be cast within a zeroth-order optimization framework, which allows incorporating functionality-preserving manipulations. This permits the deployment of sound and efficient gradient-free optimization algorithms, which come with theoretical guarantees and allow for minimal hyper-parameters tuning. As a by-product, we propose and study ZEXE, a novel zeroth-order attack against Windows malware detection.

However, large-area SPAD-based imagers, particularly wafer-scale X-ray detectors, face challenging energy-efficiency requirements, as millions of pixels operate concurrently at high bias voltages above the breakdown voltage, leading to significant power consumption and thermal management requirements. This review highlights various SPAD structures across different fabrication processes, such as front-side illumination process (FSI), and back-side illumination process (BSI). It also summarizes recent advances in pixel-level front-end circuits that manage the recharge of the SPAD while minimizing power consumption. Furthermore, optimized counter architectures for the SPAD pixel are discussed, with emphasis on extrapolation-based techniques that extend the dynamic range while reducing the overall power consumption of the SPAD-based detectors. By combining these techniques, energy-efficient SPAD-based detectors for medical imaging applications can be realized, where compact integration, thermal management, and patient safety are critical."

Radar-based monitoring offers a promising solution, but the resulting high-dimensional data presents challenges for real-time analysis and anomaly detection. In this study, we propose a radar-based anomaly detection framework built on Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation, which transforms raw radar returns into informative spatio-temporal features. Our approach integrates three deep learning models—Deep SVDD, Autoencoders, and a supervised 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—to identify abnormal movements that deviate from typical worker behavior. To boost the performance of unsupervised methods, we introduce a dynamic thresholding mechanism that adjusts to shifts in environmental conditions, improving reliability in noisy and cluttered scenes. In evaluations using real-world radar data from industrial settings, the supervised 2D CNN achieved 99.9% accuracy, while all models recorded F1-scores between 0.98 and 0.99. Notably, Deep SVDD delivered the fastest inference time at 1.71 seconds, supporting the feasibility of real-time deployment. Additionally, lightweight Transformer-based models were compared, showing comparable accuracy but higher computational cost, reaffirming the practicality of the proposed designs for edge-oriented industrial sensing."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, the growing demand for electricity charging has driven the evolution of private charging infrastructure toward shared deployment. Shared Charging Systems (SCSs) play a vital role in integrating both private and public Charging Piles (CPs), thereby improving overall resource utilization. However, such multi-party SCSs introduce challenges in security and fairness. EVs and CPs exchange parameters via wireless communication to optimize the charging process, which may exposes various threats such as tampering, eavesdropping, replay, and deletion attacks. Meanwhile, the distributed deployment of CPs complicates charging fee calculation management and may lead to issues such as malicious overcharging. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled secure authentication and fair trading scheme, ensuring secure communication while guaranteeing transparency and fairness for SCSs. First, we design a pairing-free heterogeneous signcryption algorithm that supports distributed key generation. It realizes efficient mutual authentication based on this algorithm while preventing information leakage during the process. We provide a rigorous security proof under the Random Oracle Model (ROM) to establish its security. Second, we develop a blockchain-based smart contract mechanism to enable decentralized and transparent charging fee calculation, as well as automated payments. By eliminating third-party intermediaries, our solution reduces trading costs whle effectively addresses challenges such as charging fee calculation difficulties and malicious overcharging in distributed CP deployments. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches in terms of both computational and communication overhead. Additionally, our smart contracts incur extremely low gas costs, enhancing the feasibility of the scheme."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays a central role in enhancing diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment strategies, and in this work, the focus is on segmenting retinal vessels from color fundus images. Precise vessel extraction is essential because vessel morphology reflects several ophthalmic conditions. Wide neural networks such as U Net and KiU-Net have improved retinal vessel segmentation; however, thin and low-contrast vessel regions remain difficult to capture. U Net follows an undercomplete design that limits its ability to retain fine structures, whereas KiU Net combines undercomplete and overcomplete paths to provide better detail extraction but still suffers from accuracy limitations and increased computational cost. We present an Optimized KiU Net model that improves the segmentation of thin and low-contrast retinal vessels while keeping the model lightweight. The design refines convolution channel selection and increases encoder depth, and the final feature fusion uses a single concatenation step, which supports faster convergence with fewer parameters. On the RITE dataset, the model achieves an F1 score of 79.80 and an IoU of 66.30, outperforming U Net, KiU-Net, and other similar sized architectures. Compared to KiU Net, the gains are about four points in F1 and six points in IoU with fewer parameters. Additional evaluation on the GlaS dataset shows F1 and IoU scores of 82.21 and 71.03, demonstrating that the method remains effective when compared with existing approaches of comparable scale."

    "abstract": "The increased frequency of Earth's surface anomalies has severely impacted ecological systems and people's lives. One potential approach for on-orbit Earth's surface anomaly detection using instantaneous remote sensing data is based on the spatial distribution regularity of surface features, which requires precise scene segmentation of remote sensing images. However, the current study fails to account for boundary features between segmentation scenes, leading to segmentation errors and hindering the interpretation of surface object distribution patterns. Therefore, this study proposes an unsupervised scene segmentation and optimization method that integrates adjacent edge features with spectral information. First, a new heterogeneity edge adjacent indicator (HEAI) is proposed that jointly utilizes adjacent edges and spectral information, which constrains segmentation results across remote sensing scenes with varying resolutions. Secondly, the deep clustering segmentation method is improved by introducing an optimization strategy, which replaces the original fixed-parameter termination strategy. The overall accuracy of the proposed method ranges from 0.85 to 0.89 in different scenes. The results indicated the proposed method achieved efficient performance in weak inter-heterogeneity scenes with no predefined parameters, which could finally support the real-time on-orbit Earth's surface anomalies detection."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a game theory model of digital technology innovation (DTI) within a two-tier supply chain involving manufacturers and logistics providers, with a shared goal of carbon emission reduction. The model examines how manufacturers and logistics providers can adopt integrated innovation to enhance both carbon reduction and DTI performance while maximizing mutual benefits. The analysis yields three key findings: First, DTI does not always lead to carbon reduction within the supply chain through the integration of manufacturers and logistics providers. Instead, optimal integration strategies and responsibility allocation models should be contingent on the capabilities of manufacturers and logistics providers. Second, when logistics providers have significantly superior capabilities, they should assume full responsibility for both carbon reduction and DTI services. Conversely, when manufacturers have significantly superior capabilities, they should lead carbon reduction efforts while the logistics provider focuses on DTI. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the robustness of the results with respect to different profit coefficients and cost-sharing ratios. Third, we extend the model to consider the carbon trading mechanism and external DTI effects on market demand and show that the findings are robust when these additional mechanisms and levers are introduced. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Managerial relevance statement</i> - First, the paper offers managerial guidance by introducing three Integrated Innovation between Logistics Provider and Manufacturer (II-LM) models that are adaptable to diverse industrial scenarios. Engineering managers should tailor their DTI strategies to the specific conditions of their enterprises. By adopting the II-LM strategies, they can enhance collaboration and achieve both carbon reduction and DTI engineering objectives. Second, the “double benefit” effect of carbon trading can encourage policymakers to accelerate the development of carbon trading policies and market mechanisms. Finally, for United Nation's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this paper contributes to SDG 9, SDG 12, and SDG 13."

    "abstract": "In this letter, a prescribed performance function-based data-driven virtual setpoint P-type controller (PPF-DDVSPC) is proposed for single-input single-output (SISO) systems with nonlinear nonaffine dynamics. First, the original model with error constraint is converted into an unconstrained form using the prescribed performance function and error transformation technique. A virtual setpoint updating law, nested within the outer layer of the traditional P-type controller, is developed based on the newly defined unconstrained variable to limit the tracking error. Then, the unconstrained model and virtual setpoint law are converted into the available equivalent linear data models through dynamic linearization technology. The unknown pseudo-partial derivatives in the two models are estimated utilizing the modified projection algorithm. Finally, the P-type controller with prescribed performance is obtained by replacing the actual setpoint signal with the resulting virtual setpoint law. The bounded input and bounded output (BIBO) stability of the system is demonstrated by the contraction mapping principle, which ensures that the constraint conditions are satisfied. The effectiveness and robustness of the PPF-DDVSPC method are validated through a data-driven simulation of the blast furnace ironmaking process."

    "abstract": "High temperature superconducting (HTS) conductor on round core (CORC) cable has been considered as an outstanding choice for power applications due to its advantages of high current-carrying density and robust mechanical properties. However, heat generation resulting from the AC loss of CORC cable will increase the cooling burden and in turn affect the operation and maintenance safety of the system. In this paper, both rigid-core CORC cables and flexible-core CORC cables are fabricated. Equivalent modelling for the flexible former of corrugated tube is proposed and the simulation validity is verified through transport loss experiment. Transport AC loss characteristics of flexible-core cables are evaluated and compared with traditional rigid-core cables. Result shows that for single-layer cable, the former selection of corrugated tube with low electrical conductivity could also significantly reduce eddy current losses; while for double-layer cables, hysteresis loss in HTS tapes always dominates total loss despite changes in the central former. Conclusions obtained from this paper will provide valuable guidance for the preparation and optimization of CORC cables."

However, existing systems often lack robustness in environments with fast motion, dynamic lighting, or low texture. This letter introduces ML-SLAM, a hybrid visual-inertial SLAM system that combines point-line features with learning-based techniques to improve performance in these challenging conditions. Built on the ORB-SLAM3 framework, ML-SLAM incorporates SuperPoint for adaptive keypoint detection and LightGlue for robust feature matching, along with a novel endpoint-based point-line association strategy to enhance tracking reliability in complex scenes. The system also features hybrid feature-based loop-closure detection and tightly coupled bundle adjustment (BA) incorporating inertial measurements, adapted as standard modules in the ORB-SLAM3 backend to seamlessly integrate the hybrid point-line frontend with the established backend. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC, TartanAir, UMA-VI, and real-world indoor datasets show that ML-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with over 20% improvement in localization accuracy compared to ORB-SLAM3."

    "abstract": "To address the technical challenge of determining strong coupling parameters for unknown structures or noncooperative targets, this study presents a method for extracting strong coupling frequencies based on echo signal analysis. Electromagnetic simulations reveal that strong coupling frequencies manifest distinct features in echo signals: frequency-domain valleys and time-domain double-peak envelopes. Conversely, echo signals at nonstrong coupling frequencies resemble the transmitted waveform, exhibiting square-wave envelope characteristics with transient noise at pulse edges. Experimental validation demonstrates high consistency between strong coupling frequencies extracted via echo detection and those obtained from simulations/measurements, confirming the method’s accuracy. This approach overcomes limitations of traditional simulation and testing methods by enabling noninvasive parameter extraction without requiring prior target material or structural information. The results provide critical technical support for parameter optimization of high-power microwave systems and electromagnetic pulse effect evaluation/protection design."

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi has existed for almost 30 years now. In that period, it has evolved by means of several versions, the most recent one being Wi-Fi 7. However, the technology has good backwards compatibility, which allows coexistence between newer and older equipment. That, in turn, allows for a gradual migration to newer versions of Wi-Fi, which brings up several questions, such as: how prevalent are the most recent versions of Wi-Fi? how common are deployments which still use legacy versions? Surprisingly, information on those issues is scarce and the available data is based on indirect measurements or is biased. In this work, we take a more direct approach to measuring WiFi versions adoption. We report on our methodology as well as results from a case study conducted in Lisbon, Portugal. Results suggest that the adoption time for newer Wi-Fi versions is rather slow, indicating that older versions remain relevant for significant periods of time."

All functional layers, including the bottom Ag electrode, p-type PEDOT:PSS, and n-type ZnO, are deposited exclusively by inkjet printing, enabling a scalable and low-temperature additive process compatible with large-area flexible electronics. While PEDOT:PSS/ZnO heterostructures have been widely studied for optoelectronic and diode applications, they are typically realized using partially printed or vacuum-processed layers and are not optimized for memristive operation. Here, we demonstrate that fully printed PEDOT:PSS/ZnO heterojunctions exhibit pronounced rectifying I–V characteristics, a clear threshold for switching, and a stable hysteretic response indicative of memristive behavior. The device response stabilizes after an initial forming cycle and maintains reproducible high- and low-resistance states over repeated voltage sweeps. Furthermore, under voltage pulse sequences the heterojunction shows short-term potentiation and depression, with the conductance depending on the history of applied pulses, mimicking synaptic plasticity. These results highlight fully inkjet-printed PEDOT:PSS/ZnO heterojunctions on flexible substrates as promising candidates for low-cost, large-area artificial synapses and printed neuromorphic circuits."

Leveraging the high temporal resolution and dynamic range of events, EvTurM achieves robust restoration under diverse turbulence conditions. EvTurM comprises two key modules: (1) the event-aware modality enhancement module, which uses event-derived motion to enrich RGB features and recover structural details, and (2) the bidirectional modality calibration module, which jointly aligns RGB and event features in forward and backward propagation to reduce misalignment and enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show EvTurM consistently surpasses existing methods and achieves superior performance."

    "abstract": "Exploiting oceanic resources necessitates sophisticated real-time, multi-dimensional surveillance technologies integrated with high-bandwidth, low-latency wireless communication systems. These are essential not only to ensure successful underwater operations but also to identify and address potential ecosystem issues promptly. Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) emerges as the most suitable solution to fulfill the aforementioned communication requirements. However, diverse human exploitation activities can generate bubbles, turbulence, and plumes, which significantly degrade the channel conditions of UWOC systems. Among these external interferences, plumes, primarily generated by the sediment resuspension during the deep-sea mining process, can dramatically scatter and absorb light, leading to UWOC link disruption. This paper proposes and demonstrates a 1-Gbps underwater wireless Ethernet passive optical communication network (EPON) to efficiently meet the demands of multi-node access, dynamic bandwidth allocation, and seamless network reconfiguration to accommodate new users. Commercial EPON chips are employed in system development. The proposed system incorporates a protection path mechanism, which enables reconnection when the primary wireless channel degrades due to plume interference."

However, with substantial parasitic capacitance between the planar winding and the shielding layer, severe common-mode (CM) noise is generated with the excitation of high dv/dt along the planar windings. As a result, significant CM electromagnetic interference (EMI) is created, affecting the normal operation of nearby electronic equipment. In this letter, symmetry circuit is applied to mitigate the CM noise in IPT systems. To realize a fully symmetrical propagation path and enhance CM noise cancellation, a symmetrical pattern of planar winding is proposed to reduce the CM noise without additional component. A 3-kW IPT system is built in the lab, and the proposed symmetry circuit with symmetrical pattern of planar winding can achieve 30 dB of CM noise reduction, improving the electromagnetic compatibility of the IPT systems."

    "abstract": "The growth of frequency bandwidths in the new generation of wireless networks gives rise to the multitude of wireless communication scenarios and highlights the challenges of generalized capability of the wireless communication system in different scenarios, especially the channel estimation module. In this paper, we propose a large model dubbed Conditional Latent Diffusion Channel Generation Model (C-LCGM) to learn the distributions of channel state information (CSI) in different wireless communication scenarios to form Bayesian Modeling based Channel Estimation Scheme (BMCE) for universal channel estimation. BMCE conducts universal channel estimation by generating reference CSIs from C-LCGM and mapping the reference CSIs to the optimal channel estimation neural network for each scenario. Specifically in C-LCGM, we propose to compress the CSIs into latent codes and design a conditional diffusion model to model the distribution of the latent codes given the large-scale parameters (LSP) of CSIs as the condition. Further in BMCE, we propose to deploy C-LCGM on the server center and design a hyper-network dubbed Parameters Generating Module (PGM) to map the generated CSIs of C-LCGM to the channel estimation networks for the base stations (BS) according to the reported LSPs. The design rationale and training loss of C-LCGM and BMCE are derived theoretically in this paper. We also conduct extensive simulations to verify the performance of C-LCGM and BMCE. The simulation results show that BMCE can achieve optimal channel estimation performance in different and novel scenarios with C-LCGM generating high-quality CSIs approximating the real CSIs in each scenario. Complexity analysis shows BMCE can fit the delay requirement of wireless communication systems."

However, the objective functions used in heuristicbased multipath selection mechanisms are often defined through mathematical models or network performance estimators and typically validated only in simulators, which may fail to capture the full complexity of realworld wireless environments. This paper presents the design and validation of a physical testbed composed of low-cost, single-board computers for wireless multipath video transmission. We evaluated hardware resource usage, including CPU, memory, and thermal load on the nodes. Additionally, we conducted a case study to evaluate the accuracy of objective functions used in path selection heuristics by comparing their predicted performance against real measurements obtained from the testbed. Our findings highlight the importance of physical validation and demonstrate that, while simulators can capture general performance trends, real-world testing is essential for revealing the actual bottlenecks and limitations in IoT multimedia systems."

    "abstract": "TriChewer, a multi-oral-chamber chewing robot, was developed to replicate human chewing trajectories, serving as a tool for food texture evaluation and biomimetic bolus preparation in food science. Cam profiles were designed for vertical chewing with different lateral excursions to provide small, medium and large shear strains during occlusion. The robot's kinematics were modeled, and real human chewing trajectories, measured using an optical tracking system, were converted into motor reference profiles via a closed-form inverse-kinematics transformation derived from the cam-follower geometry, with chamber-specific phase offsets. To enable head-to-head comparisons under identical actuation and ambient conditions, TriChewer operates three oral chambers in parallel, each reproducing a distinct human-inspired force-shear regime. Chamber-specific occlusal-force profiles, paired with distinct trajectories and food types, were imposed to quantify their effects on texture evolution during chewing. A position controller combining velocity/acceleration feedforward with PID feedback ensured accurate trajectory tracking. Experimental studies on roasted peanuts and breadcrumbs were conducted. Results indicate that occlusal force is the dominant determinant of chewing performance. For roasted peanuts, sufficient force progressively reduced particle size, and trajectories combining lateral shear with vertical compression outperformed pure compression. For breadcrumbs, sufficient force with minimal shear decreased thickness and increased hardness and cohesiveness, whereas excessive shear caused tearing and reduced cohesiveness. This study demonstrates the successful application of human chewing motions in a robotic system to analyze food texture dynamics."

    "abstract": "Information retrieval increasingly relies on semantics to bridge the gap between user intent and document meaning. Yet evaluations of ontology-based systems remain fragmented, which blurs comparisons and weakens reproducibility. This work presents a standards-oriented survey with a PRISMA-guided evidence synthesis. It also introduces a minimal benchmarking blueprint that links ontology design choices to evaluation practice. Rather than proposing a new retriever, we codify prevailing practice into a concise evaluation workflow and a standards-aligned reporting framework intended for low-overhead adoption. A structured search (2010–2025) with transparent screening identified 47 eligible studies, of which 38 reported sufficient data for random-effects meta-analysis. The random-effects meta-analysis indicates typical gains for ontology-enhanced systems in precision (Hedges’ g ≈ 0.81), recall (≈ 1.12), and F1 (≈ 0.93). Given substantial heterogeneity, these estimates are read as indicative ranges rather than point guarantees; sensitivity checks nonetheless preserved both direction and magnitude. Rather than broad claims, we emphasize a practical six-step workflow: scope the ontology, annotate/index, understand queries, retrieve/re-rank, evaluate and report. The workflow specifies required baselines, metrics@k, ontology provenance, and variance reporting. The manuscript is positioned as a Survey/SLR with meta-analysis, with any pragmatic departures from full PRISMA documented for transparency. Taken together, the blueprint and the evidence outline a realistic path toward more comparable and explainable ontology-based information retrieval in domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific knowledge."

These transistors operate as dynamically depleted (DD) devices, meaning that they are fully depleted at low drain bias and partially depleted at higher biases. Since the devices are processed without body contact and the Si film is moderately thick, the floating area is smaller compared to partially depleted MOSFETs, which makes the transient characterization of the FB effects challenging. The first part of this article deals with the FB effects sensitivity to the drain bias, the channel doping, the gate width, the Si-channel thickness, and the back-gate bias through static measurements and TCAD simulations. The second part proposes for the first time an extraction of the floating area charging and discharging time constants and their dependence on the previously mentioned parameters. The final part presents, by means of both measurements and TCAD, an estimation of the carriers lifetime in the analyzed devices."

Thus existing methods, without exception make a choice in two manners: most methods opt for eliminating the known class bias as much as possible with tireless efforts, while others circumvent the known class bias by employing a reconstruction method. However, in this paper, we challenge the two widely accepted approaches and present a novel proposition: the so-called harmful known class bias for most methods is, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">exactly conversely</i>, beneficial for the reconstruction-based method and thus such known class bias can serve as a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">positive-incentive</i> to the Open set recognition (OSR) models from a reconstruction perspective. Along this line, we propose the Bias Enhanced Reconstruction Learning (BERL) framework to enhance the known class bias respectively from the class level, model level and sample level. Specifically, at the class level, a specific representation is constructed in a supervised contrastive manner to avoid overgeneralization, while a diffusion model is employed by injecting the class prior to guide the biased reconstruction at the model level. Additionally, we leverage the advantages of the diffusion model to design a self-adaptive strategy, enabling effective sample-level biased sampling based on the information bottleneck theory. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and performance superiority of the proposed method."

Long-term erosion caused by sand flows will lead to the wear of the surface of composite insulators, resulting in diminished insulation performance and threatening the normal operation of transmission lines. This study employs a multi-particle erosion dynamics model and a wind-sand erosion simulation experimental platform that targets the particle morphology typical of China’s deserts and gobi regions. It analyzes the erosion damage characteristics of composite insulators due to windblown sand, and experimentally investigates the impact of sand erosion on the performance of silicone rubber materials. The results indicate that the erosion angle predominates the material damage mechanism, while the erosion velocity primarily affects the degree of surface wear. The performance degradation of silicone rubber materials is most pronounced under micro-cutting and deformation wear mechanisms, and the deterioration in material performance correlates nonlinearly with the extent of surface damage. The findings of this study can provide valuable references for the selection, optimization design, and maintenance of composite insulators in desert regions."

By constructing a structured prompt encoding model, multi-dimensional fitness function design, and population evolution mechanism, it realizes the automatic synthesis of high-quality prompts for Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluation tasks. Firstly, this paper models the prompt structure as a set of combinable language units, covering core semantic components such as objects, actions, space, quantity, and context. Secondly, it designs a five-dimensional fitness evaluation index (semantic relevance, detail coverage, spatial relationship consistency, quantity matching, and robustness) to guide the evolution direction of the prompt population. Finally, it constructs a complete prompt evolution strategy by integrating mechanisms such as elitism preservation, semantic mutation, and structural crossover. Experiments are conducted on multiple mainstream vision-language models such as BLIP-2, MiniGPT-4, and LLaVA, covering three types of tasks: image-text generation, image-text matching, and open-ended question answering. The results show that compared with manual prompts, template prompts, and prompts generated by large language models, the prompts generated by this method have significant advantages in multiple evaluation indicators, especially in spatial reasoning, quantity understanding, and context restoration. Further ablation experiments and mechanism comparison analysis also verify the effectiveness of the evolutionary algorithm in optimizing prompt structure and improving evaluation quality."

Due to the highly lossy nature of the skin, electromagnetic wave penetration is difficult. To overcome this limitation, a multi-section probe design was developed to enhance wave penetration into the skin layer. This design effectively mitigates the effects of high-loss tangents in tissues and compensates for the small size of tumors, aiding in early detection. The probe's performance is validated through simulations and experimental measurements, showing excellent agreement. For imaging evaluation, a phantom model composed of pork skin, measuring 30 mm × 30 mm with a skin thickness of 4 mm, is utilized. A total of 215 scanning points were analyzed, and time-domain reflection waves were extracted, demonstrating the probe's ability to detect variations in tissue properties accurately. These signals were then processed using an entropy-based method. The reconstructed images across various scenarios highlight the effectiveness of the proposed probe in achieving high-resolution microwave imaging, indicating its strong potential for non-invasive, early-stage tumor detection."

    "abstract": "Existing multi-organ segmentation methods usually rely on large and fully labeled datasets for training. However, medical image datasets are typically decentralized by privacy constraints and partially labeled due to the high costs of full annotation in clinical practice, resulting in label inconsistency across medical centers. Federated learning offers privacy-preserving decentralized training, but the label inconsistency leads to significant divergence in local model parameters across medical centers, thereby hindering the achievement of the global optimum. To resolve this issue, an effective and communication-efficient Federated Learning under Reliable Supervision (FedRS) is proposed, which ensures: i) the local models are trained with reliable supervisory information through the proposed Less-Forgetting and Less-Constraint loss functions, thereby reducing the divergence in local model parameters; and ii) the global model is aggregated based on the consistency of predictions between each local model (after local training) and the global model (received before training), thereby enhancing the reliability of the global model. Extensive experimental results on nine publicly available 3D abdominal CT image datasets show that our FedRS outperforms localized, centralized, and state-of-the-art federated learning methods on both in-federation and out-of-federation datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability. In particular, our FedRS only utilizes a model with only 4.1M parameters as its backbone, thereby significantly reducing its communication cost.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an uplink secure communication system where an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assists transmissions between ground users (GUs) and a base station (BS). The system faces a critical challenge from a mobile UAV eavesdropper (UAE) that adaptively adjusts its trajectory to maximize eavesdropping. To counter this threat, the legitimate UAV is designed with a dual role: carrying the IRS to enhance legitimate links while simultaneously acting as an active jammer to disrupt the UAE. We formulate the problem as maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of the legitimate UAV through joint optimization of its trajectory, jamming power, GU transmit power and scheduling, and IRS phase shifts, while the UAE optimizes its trajectory to maximize its eavesdropping rate. This adversarial interaction is modeled as a non-cooperative game, for which we define and prove the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE). To solve the resulting high-dimensional, coupled optimization problem, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework where the UAV and UAE act as independent agents. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed scheme to the NE and demonstrate that the dual-role UAV design significantly improves secrecy performance by effectively suppressing eavesdropping."

However, high-fidelity terrain-aware simulations are computationally expensive, and the joint optimization of base-station locations and antenna orientations quickly becomes intractable. We address this challenge with a sequential, stage-wise framework that integrates Bayesian optimization to decompose the high-dimensional placement problem into tractable subproblems, guided by geometric priors to avoid poor placements. Using a Longley-Rice-based simulator, we evaluate deployments across multiple mountainous regions in Japan with receivers at different altitudes. The proposed method consistently improves volumetric coverage and sample efficiency compared to Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and direct highdimensional Bayesian optimization. For example, on the Fuji and Alps scenarios it achieves over 77 % coverage and exceeds 80 % of a approximate upper bound in less than 630 seconds, which the baselines do not achieve, while on the Shikoku scenario it attains near-complete coverage. These results demonstrate that stagewise decomposition with simple priors is an effective strategy for terrain-aware 3D coverage maximization under expensive simulations, providing strong solutions when time budgets are constrained."

Resource allocation to meet IoT device demands is an NP-hard optimization problem, which restricts the applicability of exact algorithms in largescale scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes an exact algorithm based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, which serves as a reference bound for comparison, along with heuristic and metaheuristic approaches designed to enhance scalability and minimize costs. The heuristic strategies include a greedy algorithm, which employs a cost function to prioritize allocations, and a randomized algorithm, which explores solution space through random selection. The metaheuristic strategy is based on the Simulated Annealing (SA) technique. Experiments conducted in realistic Smart City scenarios demonstrate that the randomized algorithm may lead to poor allocation choices, resulting in higher costs and lower acceptance rates. On the other hand, the greedy algorithm achieved acceptance rates of up to 71 % with reduced costs, while SA further enhanced the solution quality, reaching a 96 % acceptance rate and reducing operational costs by up to approx. 40.3 % compared to the randomized algorithm. Additionally, both the greedy and the SA-based algorithms achieved runtime reductions greater than approx. 99 % compared to the exact algorithm based on the ILP model, enabling scalable and near real-time decision-making in large-scale IoT environments."

Muon tomography (MT) has emerged as a promising technology in a variety of applications, from detecting contraband in border security to studying the interior of natural or human-made structures, detecting nuclear waste, and monitoring hazards. Current muon imaging techniques have many challenges, e.g., low muon flux, poor spatial resolution, and uncertainty in muon tracks. Conventional reconstruction algorithms, e.g., PoCA (Point of Closest Approach) suffer from insufficient precision of object localization. In this paper, to improve the precision of object locations, we propose three novel computationally efficient and reliable machine learning models (ML) for constructing binary maps of image locations. ML models are trained on positive and negative imprints of objects to predict the binary map of the object locations. We train our ML models separately on straight muon rays, scattered muon rays, and a combination of straight and scattered muon rays. The combination of straight and scattered muon-rays gives a dual view of the object locations. Our proposed novel ML model architectures, along with combined trained data, solve the hard inverse problem of object detection and location efficiently. Our experimental results validate our method compared to the standard algorithm."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the AIGC wave reshaping the creative design landscape, color design is rapidly transitioning from intuition-driven to data-intelligence. However, a critical \"semantic gap\" persists between abstract human intentions and controllable parameters of generative tools. To address this challenge, this study proposes and neurocognitively validates a computational framework for semantic color design, grounded in the Chinese linguistic context. The framework integrates two core modules: 1) Semantic Deconstruction, which constructs a multidimensional color-semantic lexicon from Chinese multisource texts using natural language processing and 2) Parametric Mapping, which establishes a controllable model to map structured semantics to quantitative color parameters in the perceptually uniform CIELAB space. Critically, we employed event-related potentials to validate the framework’s semantic accuracy in this cultural context. Neuroscientific evidence has confirmed that colors generated by our framework elicit cognitive responses consistent with target semantics; the N400 effect was statistically equivalent to that of a highly congruent baseline (equivalence test, p < 0.01). The study further revealed a hierarchical contribution of color attributes to semantic conveyance: hue played a decisive role, followed by brightness, whereas the influence of saturation was limited. The proposed framework not only offers a scientific paradigm for bridging the semantic gap in color design but also provides a computational blueprint for next-generation AIGC tools, enabling them to move beyond randomness toward precise, controllable, and semantically meaningful color generation."

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic systems, designed to execute Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) efficiently, feature a many-core architecture equipped with a Network-on-Chip (NoC) to facilitate spike communication. The distributed memory and decentralized computation require partitioning SNNs into multiple subnetworks, each executed on a neuromorphic core in parallel. However, the increasing scale of SNNs leads to high inter-core spike traffic and expensive computational cost of partitioning algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose SNNcut, an efficient partitioning method for large-scale SNNs using spike-sharing. This approach fully exploits spike-sharing by using one NoC packet to deliver multiple spikes of information to reduce spike traffic. Meanwhile, instead of exhaustively searching over neurons in SNN, SNNcut indexes neurons based on the layer connection pattern and clusters sequentially, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and ensures the efficiency of large-scale SNN partitioning. Experimental results demonstrate that SNNcut achieves an average reduction in spike traffic of 98.97%, compared to 74.98% from state-of-the-art existing methods. In addition, the SNNs partitioned by SNNcut require only 5.7%∼15.7% neuromorphic core consumption of previous works. In a large-scale scenario, existing methods take more than 100 hours to accomplish the partitioning, while SNNcut only needs 10 minutes. We also validate the scalability of SNNcut by testing on edge cases with 3.2B neurons and 902B synapses."

To address this issue, a source-free domain adaptation method based on embedding space recovery is presented for TSA. First, an end-to-end multi-task learning framework is proposed, which ensures the integrity of transient features and the distinguishability of system states by sharing spatio-temporal features to recover missing feature spaces and align transient features across domains. Next, a spatio-temporal variational autoencoder (STVAE) is introduced, which avoids the accumulation of imputation errors by recovering the feature space of missing data, using spatial modeling from the power system topology and graph convolutional networks to guide temporal feature recovery. Additionally, an evaluation metric approximation mechanism is proposed to address sample imbalance by converting confusion matrix-based metrics into differentiable loss functions, allowing for direct optimization and improved model performance. This method enables the stability assessment of power systems with missing data, ensuring both rapid assessment and data privacy. Finally, simulation results using the 39-bus and 145-bus systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

This paper proposes a decoupled detailed equivalent model (D-DEM) for BESS-integrated MMC for electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation. The proposed model can accurately represent the dynamics of the converter under deblocking and blocking modes. To efficiently utilize available hardware resources, a multi-rate simulation technique is adopted to simulate the MMC subsystems with different time steps. Additionally, switching interpolation technique is proposed to accurately compensate for the intra-time-step switching events of the MMC multi-valves. To further accelerate the EMT simulation of MMC, a hybrid parallel computing EMT solver is implemented, using both central and graphical processing units (CPU-GPU). The accuracy of the proposed D-DEM is validated against a detailed model (DM) using Simulink/Simscape Electrical toolbox with 1μs time step. The simulation efficiency of the proposed D-DEM is faster than the conventional DEM model by a factor of 2.81 with CPU-only implementation for the MMC with 400 submodules per arm. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid CPU-GPU solver achieves 79-fold faster than the CPU-only sequential implementation."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a variational Bayesian inference (VBI) based algorithm for gridless and online estimation of multiple two-dimensional directions of arrival (2D-DOAs), whose number and angle states are both time-varying. A likelihood model is first derived for a rectangular array, after which a conjugate hierarchical prior is assigned to the parameters to be estimated. The VBI is then leveraged to recursively and analytically compute the multiple sources posterior, based on which 2D-DOAs are extracted straightforwardly based on the posterior without the need for spatial discretisation. A remarkable feature of the proposed algorithm is that all parameters, including signal powers and noise power, are estimated within a probabilistic framework, and the posterior can be propagated over time to integrate information from previously received signals. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed estimator delivers markedly lower localisation error and superior robustness compared with state-of-the-art approaches, especially when the number of active sources changes abruptly under severe low SNR conditions."

    "abstract": "The use of radar sensors for recognizing human motion offers a unique benefit in scenarios focused on privacy protection, which has gained significant attention in the field of radar-based measurements. The advancement in radar-based motion recognition is greatly enhanced by the evolution of deep learning techniques; however, it necessitates that the data support is both adequate and readily accessible simultaneously. Considering the difficulties involved in collecting radar data, it is preferable to design a radar-based model without having adequate data prepared initially for real-world applications. To address this issue, this article presents a radar-based motion recognition model integrating online learning capabilities. To combat the potential issue of catastrophic forgetting during online learning, we have introduced a hard example learning scheme alongside the generation of hard examples. Additionally, taking into account the probable few-shot characteristics in batch-feeding data supports, we have created placeholders to facilitate inter-class separation, reducing the misalignment in the samples included in the incremental sessions. Radar-based motion datasets have been established to verify the proposed model, which maintains over 90% recognition accuracy after four incremental sessions. In contrast, the best comparative methods fall below 83%, showcasing the proposed model's specialization in the online pattern. The ablation experiments and discussion were conducted to thoroughly evaluate our model's efficacy and generalization ability, in addition to the experiments on radar measurements that reaffirm its effectiveness."

However, the increasing reliance on Machine Learning and Deep Learning (DL) exposes ADS to adversarial attacks, particularly transferable evasion attacks, where Adversarial Examples (AE) crafted for one model can deceive others. Despite their importance, limited research has examined the transferability of adversarial attacks in industrial and IoT contexts or the effectiveness of defense strategies against them. This work systematically evaluates the transferability of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">adversarial evasion attacks</i> across six ADS models, including both tree-based and neural network architectures, trained on industrial and IIoT scenarios datasets. We also analyze multiple adversarial detection methods, measuring not only their performance, but also their computational efficiency in terms of execution time, processor utilization, and energy consumption. Our results show that most ADS are vulnerable to transferable evasion attacks and that existing detection methods fail in model- and attack-agnostic settings. We further demonstrate that incorporating adversarial learning with a small set of low-perturbation examples significantly improves detection while maintaining low computational overhead, enabling practical and efficient real-time deployment."

Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot’s position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground–aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared (IR) markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view (FOV) and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multisource measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures."

    "abstract": "This article addresses the consensus tracking control problem for a class of unparametrizable noncanonical nonlinear multi-agent systems. Most existing consensus tracking control schemes for nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) are restricted to canonical-form system models. For noncanonical-form nonlinear MASs, to our best knowledge, there is still no result available so far due to some challenging technical issues encountered in design and analysis. Firstly, existing distributed observers are limited to canonical systems by the assumption that the output matrix of leader is known, rendering them inapplicable to noncanonical nonlinear systems. Moreover, current adaptive distributed observer frameworks only consider first-order differentiability of the system matrix, missing the information of higher-order derivative. Secondly, unlike the traditional Lyapunov method for canonical systems, noncanonical systems require augmented error analysis for stability, and extending this to noncanonical nonlinear MASs is highly challenging. Thirdly, unparametrizable nonlinear functions in the original system complicate control design. To tackle these issues, an approximate Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models are constructed to eliminate non-parametric functions, alongside a novel adaptive distributed observer for estimating leader information. Simulations verify the effectiveness of our control scheme in achieving consensus control tracking."

To address these issues, we propose FreDNet, a frequency-guided denoising network that explicitly enhances frequency-sensitive representations throughout the segmentation process. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-path Residual Block (DRB), which incorporates a Frequency-aware Denoising Module (FDM) and a Frequency-aware Fusion Module (FFM) to suppress frequency-domain noise while preserving edge structures. Furthermore, we design a Frequency-aware Cross-level Fusion Module (FCFM) that leverages frequency intensity response maps to adaptively fuse encoder and decoder features. These components work collaboratively to enhance the frequency robustness and spatial consistency of the segmentation predictions. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, ISPRS Vaihingen, ISPRS Potsdam, and LoveDA, demonstrate that FreDNet achieves superior performance, surpassing the latest state-of-the-art approaches by up to 0.8% in mean IoU and 0.9% in overall accuracy, while maintaining a lightweight inference cost. In addition, ablation study confirms the contribution of each component of FreDNet."

    "abstract": "In Ethereum, DevP2P is the fundamental network-layer protocol set that supports consensus mechanisms, transaction propagation and smart contract execution. Due to the importance of DevP2P, its bugs can be exploited by the attacker to cause security problems like denial of service, leading to property loss on Ethereum. However, existing blockchain testing approaches focus on the bug detection of consensus and application layers, causing many serious DevP2P bugs to be missed. In fact, detecting DevP2P bugs has some key challenges, including how to generate effective inputs and how to detect complex bugs. This paper designs D2PFuzz, the first network-layer differential fuzzing approach of bug detection for Ethereum. It consists of two key techniques: (1) a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">query-based fuzzing strategy</i> that dynamically generates valid DevP2P messages according to network, chain and node state changes; and (2) a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-node differential checking method</i> that identifies important differences of DevP2P response messages from multiple nodes in the same blockchain to detect semantic bugs. We have evaluated D2PFuzz on five open-source and popular Ethereum node implementations, including Geth, Erigon, Reth, Besu and Nethermind. D2PFuzz in total finds 15 unique bugs, 12 of which are previously unknown. Compared to two state-of-the-art blockchain testing approaches including LOKI and Hive, D2PFuzz improves testing coverage by 3.7x and 21.6x, respectively, and finds 13 bugs missed by these approaches."

Subsequently, we compute the pairwise similarity between all target masks and construct an undirected, unweighted graph, from which the maximum clique is identified, thus obtaining the most probable correct masks, referred to as refined masks. Finally, we propose single-dimensional mask encoding to efficiently achieve precise 3D target masks through supervision with refined masks.

Experimental results clearly demonstrate that FL-GS outperforms existing methods in open-vocabulary 3D fuzzy querying."

We also present a strictification technique for constructing a decreasing ISS- Lyapunov function from a large class of generalized ones, which is useful for its own sake. Our findings also have added value to previous research that only studied sufficient conditions for ISS, as our results apply to a broader class of systems. This is because we impose less restrictive dwell and leave time constraints on the switching signal and our ISS- Lyapunov functions are time-varying with general nonlinear conditions imposed on them. Moreover, we provide a method to guarantee ISS of a particular class of impulsive switched systems when the switching signal is unknown."

    "abstract": "The vehicular metaverse is a novel physical-virtual fusion realm that aims to disrupt the current transportation paradigm. Within this landscape, the coexistence of moving vehicles and their digital counterparts inevitably brings new privacy concerns. Pseudonym exchange, where vehicles exchange temporary identifiers with neighbors to enhance anonymity, offers an affordable solution to protect the location privacy of vehicles. However, existing pseudonym exchange schemes primarily focus on physical vehicles, limiting their effectiveness across physical and virtual spaces in the vehicular metaverse. Furthermore, studies have shown that many vehicles care little about their location privacy, so incentivizing more vehicles to participate in pseudonym exchanges remains a challenge. Motivated by these issues, we propose a physical-virtual dual pseudonym exchange scheme, incorporating an Attribute-Matched Double Dutch Auction (AMDDA) incentive mechanism to facilitate pseudonym exchange transactions. We use a trajectory prediction model to evaluate vehicle attributes, ensuring pseudonym exchange between vehicles with high trajectory similarity to enhance location privacy preservation. Furthermore, we devise a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based approach to derive the optimal pricing strategy in the AMDDA market. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves both the efficiency and degree of location privacy protection."

However, large-scale implementations often incur excessive control overhead and computational complexity. This paper proposes a Spirograph-based (SG) discrete beamforming framework that constructs a scalable RIS codebook using non-uniform quantization points derived from parametric Spirograph geometry. The proposed approach quantizes beam directions rather than individual phase shifts, thereby minimizing signaling requirements while maintaining near-optimal phase alignment between reflected and direct paths. A reduced-codebook mechanism is further developed to eliminate redundant beams in irregular coverage regions, significantly lowering complexity without compromising performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the SG scheme achieves over 95% of the average data rate of the ideal continuous phase-shift method while reducing control overhead by more than 98% compared with the discrete phase-shift (DPS) approach. Notably, SG outperforms DPS by up to 2.5 Mbit/s in average data rate. Moreover, the Beam-Angle Region (BAR) selection algorithm achieves a favorable trade-off between data rate and complexity, providing near–exhaustive-search performance with approximately 20% fewer beam evaluations. These results confirm that the proposed SG framework offers an efficient, scalable, and geometrically robust solution for large-scale RIS-assisted wireless communication systems."

While learning-based traversability has been widely studied for these platforms, bipedal traversability has instead relied on manually designed rules with limited consideration of locomotion stability on rough terrain. In this work, we present the first learning-based traversability estimation and risk-sensitive navigation framework for bipedal robots operating in diverse, uneven environments. TravFormer, a transformer-based neural network, is trained to predict bipedal instability with uncertainty, enabling risk-aware and adaptive planning. Based on the network, we define traversability as stability-aware command velocity—the fastest command velocity that keeps instability below a user-defined limit. This velocity-based traversability is integrated into a hierarchical planner that combines traversability-informed Rapid Random Tree Star (TravRRT*) for time-efficient path planning and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for safe execution. We validate our method in MuJoCo simulator and the real world, demonstrating improved stability, time efficiency, and robustness across diverse terrains compared with existing methods.

    "abstract": "Infrastructure projects frequently exceed their budgeted costs, placing an undue financial burden on taxpayers. A key contributing factor is the tendency among engineers and related professionals to conflate risk with epistemic uncertainty when estimating contingencies, resulting in inadequate allowances for unexpected costs (e.g., scope changes, design modifications, or documentation errors). Treating epistemic uncertainty through a risk-based lens is problematic: it oversimplifies the nature of unknowns, creates blind spots, and leads to misjudgments about project complexity and cost. This paper argues that cost contingencies should address risk and epistemic uncertainty as distinct concepts, each requiring different decision-making approaches. Specifically, it advocates for the use of smart heuristics-simple, task-specific strategies-for managing uncertainty where statistical tools fall short. These heuristics are particularly suited to contexts characterized by unknown or unknowable variables influencing construction costs. The paper identifies and outlines several decision-making tools for dealing with uncertainty. Explicitly accounting for epistemic uncertainty in contingency estimation is vital for improving the accuracy of infrastructure cost estimates"

    "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is fundamentally reshaping society, heralding the next evolutionary phase of the Internet. This paradigm promises to profoundly enhance capabilities for data acquisition, analysis, and remote device control. In future cellular networks, particularly Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) networks such as LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT), and New Radio (NR), the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) serves as the conduit for critical information, facilitating device connectivity in both uplink and downlink transmissions. Devices, however, operate without prior knowledge of the precise location of their encoded control messages within the control resource, necessitating blind decoding across a predefined, limited set of candidate regions. This work addresses the significant challenge faced by the base station (BS) in intelligently selecting these control resource candidates for each device to optimize data transmission. Current PDCCH designs and, consequently, existing control resource scheduling schemes lack the requisite flexibility to efficiently support the massive number of devices anticipated with CIoT network deployments. This inflexibility severely degrades network efficiency and compromises overall system performance. We formally define this challenge as the PDCCH Candidate Selection Problem, an NPhard problem. Given this complexity, a solution leveraging greedy algorithms and randomized heuristics presents a compelling approach for practical implementations. Such methods offer an advantageous trade-off between performance and computational complexity, often accompanied by strong theoretical performance guaranties. Therefore, a heuristic scheme called Global-Aware Probabilistic Packing (GPP) was proposed."

Moreover, we compare our approach to an energy detector in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. The reader employs beamforming to steer the beams towards tags and RF source, improving the strength of the tag signal, attenuating the interferences and improving the estimation of the source signal, which is used in the correlation technique to build features for the SVM detector. Simulation results show that our correlation-based detector consistently out-performs the MMSE and energy detection benchmarks, especially in low SNR conditions and can support detection in the presence of multiple RF sources."

These data enable the creation of datasets, machine learning (ML) models, and efficient workflows that can be shared across organisations. However, since this information is commercially sensitive, precise access control is essential. In a centralised access control mechanism, each participant must trust that the others follow the rules. To eliminate this blind trust, SDDK-AC: Secure Decentralised Data- and Knowledge Access Control for Predictive Machinery Maintenance is introduced, which couples Attribute-Based Access Control policies with blockchain and smart contract technology, thereby turning every access request into a distributed and transparent smart contract transaction. This paper presents SDDK-AC, an access control mechanism using smart contracts and contextual attributes of geolocation and data integrity with hash verification in a collaborative predictive maintenance environment. In this scenario, direct competitors can collaborate and share operational data to forecast machine failures, enhancing their predictive maintenance capabilities. Moreover, the paper presents the results using Hyperledger Caliper, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposal."

    "abstract": "The eradication of Giant Rat Tail (GRT) grass (Sporobolus natalensis and Sporobolus pyramidalis) in southeastern and central Queensland is essential for maintaining agricultural productivity. These invasive weeds significantly deplete soil nutrients, thereby rendering the land unsuitable for crop cultivation. Moreover, their high silica, phenolic compound, and lignin content make them unpalatable to livestock, further diminishing the utility of infested pastures. This study proposes a novel methodology that integrates drone-based imaging with machine learning techniques to classify and manage GRT grass infestations. Highresolution RGB imagery of pastureland was captured using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro UAV. The collected data were subjected to square patch segmentation, resulting in over 315574 image segments categorized into GRT and non-GRT classes. For each segment, an extensive set of 37 features, encompassing texture, radiometric, runlength characteristics and color, was extracted. Subsequent data pre-processing included the removal of tiles having no data value and the partitioning of the dataset into training and testing subsets. Five tree based machine learning classifiers-Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and XGBoost Random Forest Classifier-were developed and assessed. The classification performance was optimized by retraining the XGBoost classifier using the top 21 features identified based on their importance as determined by the already trained XGBoost classifier. Among the evaluated models, the XGBoost classifier with top 21 features achieved the highest accuracy (95.5 %), along with robust performance metrics for GRT classification, including a precision of 95.3 %, recall of 94.2 %, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F 1$</tex> score of 94.7 %.

    "abstract": "Efficiently utilizing the energy-saving potential of reversible converter (RC) has received significant attention in urban rail transit with reversible substations. However, energy management is considerably challenged by the highly dynamic and stochastic nature of train operations when relying on traditional methods. Therefore, a real-time energy management model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed in this paper. The model aims to minimize energy consumption through real-time decision-making, in which an agent dynamically optimizes RC control parameters using continuous state feedback from trains, traction substations (TSs), and main substations (MSs). A novel reward function is designed to incorporate both safety constraints and a day-ahead optimization benchmark, thereby effectively coordinating operational safety with energy efficiency. Moreover, stochastic timetable disturbances are introduced during training to enhance the model's robustness. Simulations based on Qingdao Metro Line 3 demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves regenerative braking energy (RBE) utilization and reduces reverse power at the MSs, achieving a daily energy saving of 8.30%. Sensitivity analysis further quantifies the impact of key parameters, including RC capacity, step-down loads, and system scale, on overall performance. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments confirm the model's practical effectiveness and robustness against communication delays, demonstrating its strong potential for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration of the 3-dB bandwidth of analog baseband (ABB) filters is critical in modern wireless transceivers. Existing replica-based and loopback-based calibration methods require substantial auxiliary hardware, impose matching constraints, or interrupt the signal path. This work presents a novel oscillator-embedded calibration technique that reconfigures a Sallen–Key (SK) or multiple-feedback (MFB) ABB filter into a Wien-bridge–equivalent oscillator only during a short calibration interval. Unlike prior approaches, the proposed method accomplishing ABB filter calibration without replica filters, loopback circuits occupying full signal chain, or high-complexity digital processing, thereby offering a fundamentally different low-cost calibration pathway. A first-order linear model, derived from post-fabrication measurements, maps the oscillator frequency to the filter’s 3-dB frequency, and a successive approximation-based capacitor-bank tuning algorithm determines the final control code. Five fabricated prototypes in a 28-nm FDSOI process were evaluated across multiple calibration codes and repeated measurement cycles. The proposed method achieves a maximum calibration error of 2.7%, with R² > 0.993 and root mean squared error (RMSE) < 1.2%, while requiring only a simple counter-based measurement and minimal hardware overhead. These results demonstrate a practical, reproducible, and low-cost calibration framework for ABB filters, suitable for integration in next-generation wireless transceivers."

However, existing works suffer from the key escrow problem and single points of failure. Moreover, decentralized alternatives often lack efficient mechanisms to prevent rogue nodes from manipulating collaborative decisions. This paper proposes a certificateless multi-signature scheme named MagicCMS, which is based on a magic square structure. By integrating element-based node collaboration through magic squares, MagicCMS ensures signature generation only when authorized node groups meet predefined constraints. This enhances security against rogue nodes. Additionally, the system utilizes a decentralized key management solution leveraging blockchain technology, thereby eliminating single points of failure. A rigorous security analysis demonstrates that MagicCMS resists both Type-I and Type-II adversaries and provides protection against rogue-key attacks. Performance evaluations show significant improvements in signature verification efficiency compared to existing schemes. In large-scale scenarios, verification computational costs are reduced by up to 73%."

Second, to address the problem that conventional SMOs are not appropriate for the reconstructed state space, an adaptive SMO is introduced. The proposed approach can mitigate chattering while maintaining the fast convergence of the sliding variable. Subsequently, a synchronous coordinate frame based low-pass filter combined with a third-order phase locked loop (PLL) is adopted to obtain the estimated rotor speed and position. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains under-explored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vector-valued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment."

    "abstract": "Although deep learning-based personalized recommendation systems provide qualified recommendations, they strain data center resources. The main bottleneck is the embedding layer, which is highly memory-intensive due to its sparse, irregular access patterns to embeddings. Recent near-memory processing (NMP) and processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have addressed these issues by exploiting parallelism within memory. However, as model sizes increase year by year and can exceed server capacity, inference on single-node servers becomes challenging, necessitating the integration of model compression. Various algorithms have been proposed for model size reduction, but they come at the cost of increased memory access and CPU–PIM communication. We present ProactivePIM, a PIM system tailored for weight-sharing algorithms, a family of compression methods that decompose an embedding table into compact subtables, such as QR-trick and TT-Rec. Our analysis shows that embedding layer execution with weight-sharing algorithms increases memory access and incurs CPU–PIM communication. We also find that these algorithms exhibit unique data locality characteristics, which we name intra-GnR locality. ProactivePIM accelerates weight-sharing algorithms by utilizing a heterogeneous HBM-DIMM memory architecture with integration of a two-level PIM system of base-die PIM (bd-PIM) and bank-group PIM (bg-PIM) inside the HBM. To gain further speedup, ProactivePIM prefetches embeddings with high intra-GnR locality into an SRAM cache within bg-PIM and eliminates the CPU-PIM communication through duplication of target subtables across bank groups. With additional optimization techniques, our design effectively accelerates weight-sharing algorithms, achieving 2.22× and 2.15× speedup in QR-trick and TT-Rec, respectively, compared to the baseline architecture."

Here, we present a miniaturized, lensless on-chip ECL imaging platform (ECL-CMOS) that integrates electrochemical sensing directly with a CMOS imaging chip via contact-mode coupling. This architecture significantly enhances photon collection efficiency, expands the imaging field of view, and eliminates the need for external optics or alignment procedures. The system enables spatiotemporal detection of ECL signals from classical reaction pairs, including luminol/H₂O₂ and Ru(bpy)₃²⁺/TPrA, with high sensitivity and reproducibility. As a proof of concept for biomedical applicability, we demonstrate sensitive and quantitative glucose detection in both synthetic and human urine samples. The ECL-CMOS platform offers a scalable, cost-effective, and high-performance solution for real-time biochemical sensing, and holds strong potential for broad deployment in POC diagnostics, environmental analysis, and resource-limited settings."

Thus, preserving SM’s privacy is paramount. While data tampering methods offer a solution, they often lead to issues like inaccurate state estimation and complex billing. To address this, we propose demand-side energy management leveraging rechargeable batteries (RB) and solar panels. This is because larger RBs are costly and environmentally unfriendly. Thus, we prioritize the use of green energy sources, such as solar panels, minimizing RB’s reliance on enhanced consumer privacy. Strategically managing loads with solar panels and grid energy sales achieves cost-effective privacy. Considering realistic off-peak and peak energy consumption periods renders our approach practical. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches."

The proposed H-MVMM scheme utilizes a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to minimize pilot sequence length and optimize the sum rate. This offers a promising solution for reducing latency in frequency division duplexing systems. To achieve this, three preprocessing modules are designed to transform raw sensory data into informative representations relevant to precoding. The approach effectively addresses local data heterogeneity arising from diverse on-board sensor configurations through a well-structured VFL training procedure. Additionally, a label-free online model updating strategy is introduced, enabling the H-MVMM scheme to adapt its weights flexibly. This strategy features a pseudo downlink channel state information label simulator (PCSI-Simulator), which is trained using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach alongside an online loss function. Numerical results show that the proposed method can closely approximate the performance of traditional optimization techniques with perfect channel state information, achieving a significant 90.6% reduction in pilot sequence length."

    "abstract": "Graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) aims to identify graphs that significantly deviate from others in a graph dataset. Existing methods predominantly rely on standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn graph representations, but they often overlook subgraph-level information, which provides essential structural and semantic cues for distinguishing normal and anomalous graphs. This limitation not only compromises the detection performance but also hinders the interpretability of GLAD predictions. To address these challenges, we propose NGLAD, a novel framework that introduces the concept of normality-relevant subgraphs that capture shared patterns across normal graphs. These subgraphs serve as key indicators to distinguish normal graphs from anomalies that that often lack or deviate from such patterns. During model training, by explicitly modeling the shared subgraph patterns inherent in normal graphs through a Subgraph Extractor and a Normality Learner, NGLAD identifies the subgraphs most relevant to normality. Leveraging the One-class Information Bottleneck principle, these modules ensure that the extracted subgraphs retain only the most informative features of normality while filtering out irrelevant nodes and edges. During inference, NGLAD detects anomalies by evaluating inconsistencies in representations between the input graph and its extracted subgraph. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NGLAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection performance while offering interpretable explanations."

    "abstract": "The popularity of cloud storage makes it easy to share others’ data, such as accessing and editing electronic medical records. To control the editing, sanitizable signatures were developed to allow designated editors to modify restricted parts of the data with sanitizing keys. In particular, attributebased sanitizable signature (ABSS) has been explored for finegrained editing control, i.e., editors are determined by the owner through a policy. However, existing ABSS schemes can neither protect the anonymity of the owner due to signature verification under the owner’s public key, nor protect the data confidentiality due to the plaintext storage in the cloud server. Moreover, they do not consider the sanitizing key exposure issue. To this end, we propose FSEdit, a privacy-preserving and security-enhanced controllable editing framework for cloud storage. Specifically, we introduce an attribute-based sanitizable and puncturable signed encryption (AB-SPSE) primitive for FSEdit, where encrypted data can be anonymously verified via the owner’s attributes, and its admissible blocks can be modified by policy-authorized editors. Meanwhile, the editors’ sanitizing keys can be further punctured to guarantee forward secrecy. We design two novel building blocks, namely attribute-based equivalence-class signature, and attribute-based puncturable combined encryption and signature, and then construct FSEdit by leveraging them to instantiate AB-SPSE in asymmetric pairings. Finally, we show the security and efficiency of FSEdit through extensive security analysis and experimental results over existing ABSS schemes."

    "abstract": "The widespread application of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) in security monitoring has increased the demand for advanced intrusion recognition algorithms. Conventional approaches often divide the process into two stages: signal processing and recognition modeling. However, this separation introduces two key challenges: (1) signal processing quality is typically assessed only through the final recognition outcome, lacking a unified optimization mechanism, which limits efficiency and generalization. (2) The two-stage framework is unsuitable for tasks requiring high real-time performance. Therefore, we propose the Frequency-Time Integrated Transformer (FTIformer) to address these challenges. FTIformer integrates the Multi-head Time-Frequency Perception (MTFP) module and the Self-Attention Module (SAM), achieving unified optimization of time-frequency signal extraction and pattern recognition through loss function backpropagation. Furthermore, in complex environments, multiple events of interest may occur within the same detection cycle, causing feature overlap and potential confusion of model outputs. To mitigate this, we decompose the multi-event recognition task into multiple single-event recognition tasks. Building on this approach, class-specific loss is proposed for the first time, which guides the model in learning unique representations for each event. We conducted experiments using a private dataset and a public dataset. Experimental results indicate that FTIformer achieves an accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.946, 0.976, and 0.979, respectively, on the private dataset, and 0.897, 0.956, and 0.966 on the public dataset.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely applied, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is gradually integrated into consumer IoT systems. Thus in the field of UAV-assisted IoT systems, consumer electronics applications such as smart delivery and security surveillance have emerged in smart home. The key challenge in achieving this integration is reliable path planning capability. To address the aforementioned issue, a new method is introduced. Hiking Optimization Algorithm (HOA) is a meta-heuristic algorithm based on mountaineering activities. To make its performance better, an Improved Hiking Optimization Algorithm (IHOA) based on good point set theory, crisscross strategy and lens imaging reverse learning is proposed. Firstly, the good point set theory is introduced at the initial population generation stage to enhance the population diversity. Then the diversity and quality of the population is continued to be improved by crisscross optimization strategy, which effectively improves the convergence speed of the algorithm. Meanwhile, the lens imaging reverse learning is utilized to enhance the optimization searching approach of the IHOA, which coordinates the algorithm's ability of global exploration and local exploitation. The effectiveness of the IHOA is validated on 9 unimodal or multimodal test functions, and compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Escape optimization algorithm (ESC) and several other methods. The experimental results show that IHOA has better optimization accuracy and efficiency. In addition, IHOA is an algorithm of explainable AI (XAI). Because its transparent and robust optimization process is a foundational step for building trustworthy systems and its decision logic is more traceable than a \"black-box\" model. Finally, IHOA is applied to the 3D UAV path planning problem. The results indicate that IHOA outperforms several recent or frequently cited optimization models, and has practical significance for solving path optimization problems in consumer electronic products such as UAVs and household robots."

    "abstract": "User grouping is a critical challenge for Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems, especially in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. In scenarios with stringent computational constraints, traditional schemes tend to leverage pairwise channel correlation for algorithm design. However, pairwise channel correlation is an indirect and unreliable metric for user grouping, potentially causing undesirable user grouping and consequently a high frame error rate (FER) in certain environments. To solve this problem, we bypass the reliance on pairwise channel correlation and propose a new user grouping metric, pairwise compatibility, which is directly modeled from historical performance data. This transition enables a pairwise compatibility-based user grouping scheme, in which we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem to directly optimize compatibility. Extensive simulations and validation show that our pairwise compatibility-based scheme exhibits a modest advantage in the spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channel, and delivers a significant performance gain in the real-world measured channel. By replacing channel correlation with compatibility, our scheme offers a more efficient and robust solution for user grouping in practical MU-MIMO-based IIoT networks."

In our previous work, we demonstrated two binary addressing systems based on sequences of pressure pulses transmitted in parallel through the same lines later used to actuate the selected elements. This approach supports distributed architectures, parallel actuation, and unlimited addresses, albeit at the cost of longer and complex addressing processes. In this work, we present multi-pressure addressing systems, which solve the primary limitation of binary designs (pressure spikes upon connection of the actuators) and are compatible with multi-pressure components like hysteretic or sequence valves. We also present a strategy for linear networks that maximizes the number of addresses for a given sequence length. We validate our designs with three physical prototypes: a hierarchical module that controls a pneumatic robotic arm, demonstrating the smooth connection of the actuators; a non-hierarchical module with a sequence valve, that triples the network addresses compared to its binary-pressure version (36 addresses, each with 4 simultaneous outputs, using 5 lines); and a linear network with 18 distributed logic modules and air reservoirs emulating adjustable distances, used to evaluate transient pressure drops over extended lengths and to validate the proposed shortened addressing strategy (19 addresses of four or fewer pressure pulses, each with 4 simultaneous outputs, using 5 lines extended up to 1900 m)."

    "abstract": "Fire ignition point detection plays a critical role in emergency response, forensic investigation, and wildfire management, yet current methods rely heavily on manual analysis that is time-intensive and subject to human error. This paper presents a novel radial-based divergence method for automated fire ignition point detection using smoke density analysis. The proposed approach transforms ignition point detection into a mathematical optimization problem by identifying maximum positive divergence in vector fields derived from smoke density distributions. The method operates effectively on both single images and comparative before/after image pairs, addressing diverse application scenarios from emergency response to forensic investigation. For single-image analysis, smoke density fields are constructed through intensity normalization and Gaussian smoothing. For comparative analysis, a multi-method framework combines RGB statistical analysis, HSV enhancement, LAB perceptual analysis, and Gaussian mixture modeling with adaptive weighting. Radial vector fields are generated using two approaches: gradient-based computation from density gradients and radial-based generation from identified density peaks. Mathematical divergence analysis identifies ignition points as locations of maximum positive divergence. Comprehensive experimental validation using sequential fire progression images, satellite wildfire imagery, and controlled fire scenarios demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. The radial-based approach achieved 87.5% success rate with 67.8 ± 38.9 pixels mean error for single-image analysis, outperforming gradient-based methods (75.0% success rate, 89.3 ± 45.2 pixels error) and significantly exceeding optical flow approaches (45-60% success rate). Comparative analysis achieved even higher accuracy with 92.3% success rate for satellite imagery and 95.8% for controlled scenarios. The computational efficiency of O(MN log(MN)) complexity with processing times of 2-12 seconds per image enables real-time deployment. The method’s foundation in physical principles of smoke dispersion provides interpretable results suitable for legal proceedings while maintaining robustness across diverse imaging conditions and scales."

The information of the faster-evading ASV is only accessible to a subset of pursuing ASVs due to their inherent limited sensing range. A safety-critical distributed planning and control architecture is proposed, enabling the cooperative capture of faster-evading ASVs. Specifically, a distributed observer is developed first to create a mechanism for sharing the faster-evading ASV information among the pursuing ASVs. Next, a nominal cooperative pursuit trajectory planning method is developed based on an Apollonius circle technique, where an encircling task and a hunting task are designed to form an encirclement formation and approach the faster-evading ASV, respectively. A safety optimization problem is then formulated to modify the nominal trajectory, outlining a collision-free capture trajectory for the pursuing ASVs. Finally, a guidance method and an extended-state-observer-based dynamic control method are proposed to track the planned pursuit trajectory. It is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable. A robot-operating-system-based simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed safety-critical cooperative pursuit planning and control method."

    "abstract": "A sideband cross-correlation (SBCC) scheme is proposed and experimentally validated for monitoring transceiver imbalances in dual-polarization (DP) coherent transmission systems. The proposed method exhibits modulation-format transparency and achieves wide detection range with low computational complexity. Channel delay is calculated through cross-correlation between the edges of the upper sideband (EUSB) and lower sideband (ELSB) while carrier frequency offset (CFO) decouples transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) skew components. By requiring only partial FFT computations in conjunction with basic arithmetic operations, the SBCC scheme achieves a substantial reduction in computational overhead compared to conventional methods such as Godard-TED. To evaluate the transparency and robustness of the proposed algorithm, a simulation platform is established to test its performance across various modulation formats while simulating key link impairments such as local oscillator frequency offset, phase noise, optical signal-to-noise ratio, and chromatic dispersion. Experimental validation is conducted using 40/20 GBaud 16-QAM and 20 GBaud 64-QAM signals transmitted over an 80km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) within a DP coherent optical communication system. The algorithm compensates for inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by IQ/XY skew within a ±20 ps range, achieving a measurement error of <0.2 ps. Notably, the compensated signal reduces the required OSNR by 3 dB at identical bit error rate (BER), particularly at the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold (BER = 3.8×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>)."

However, existing reconfiguration approaches primarily focus on algorithmic optimization, often neglecting architectural imbalance and communication bottlenecks arising from asymmetric redundancy placement. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient framework that combines a novel double-sided redundant architecture with two-stage optimization algorithms to enhance interconnect efficiency under permanent processing element (PE) faults. The proposed <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R_{l}+M+R_{r}$</tex-math></inline-formula> architecture symmetrically distributes redundant columns on both sides of the array while maintaining the same total number of spare PEs as single-sided redundancy, thereby mitigating unbalanced compensation paths and long communication distances without increasing hardware cost. Based on this structure, a shortest-path fault compensation algorithm is developed to minimize inter-PE communication distances, and a wide Tabu-based optimization algorithm is introduced as a second-stage refinement for global exploration and multi-directional reconfiguration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior communication performance and scalability compared with state-of-the-art methods under both single-sided and double-sided redundant architectures. It achieves lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced energy consumption while maintaining identical redundant resources and a smaller interconnect area footprint, confirming the efficiency and practicality of the proposed fault-tolerant topology reconfiguration strategy."

This study evaluates the control of swarm formation based on a modified Raft consensus protocol (Raft-lite) through 625 simulated scenarios in the GrADyS-SIM NextGen framework, varying communication delay, range, failure rate, and formation size. Three performance metrics were analyzed: shape error, presence error, and time without a leader. Pearson and partial correlations revealed that while the three metrics capture complementary aspects of swarm behavior, the shape error consistently integrates the geometric effects of membership and coordination losses. Multiple regression analysis (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}=0.876$</tex>) further showed that delay and failure rate dominate formation degradation, confirming that shape error encapsulates the cumulative impact of communication constraints.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance in response generation. Recent work shows that LVLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, many existing methods tend to overfit to the source model by overemphasizing specific features, which compromises their transferability. Other approaches suffer from reduced attack effectiveness due to insufficient differentiation between features. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer-based black-box untargeted attack—Shared Adversarial Feature (SAF) dynamic attack. By exploring the feature extraction patterns of LVLMs, we identify the features shared among various models that are most susceptible to adversarial attacks and disrupt them. Moreover, due to the powerful attention mechanisms of LVLMs, they are still able to extract similar semantics from perturbed images, even when primary features are disrupted. We design a dynamic update strategy to address this challenge. Finally, from the perspective of SAF, we conduct an in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities in the vision encoder and projector within LVLMs and find that attacking the projector exhibits stronger transferability across heterogeneous model architectures. Extensive experiments show that our method exhibits superior attack performance compared to existing methods across different models, datasets, and tasks. The code will be publicly available after publication."

    "abstract": "The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem for systems with uncertainty is challenging: model-based design loses optimality, while prevailing reinforcement learning methods demand prohibitive data and computation. This paper introduces a Hybrid-Driven Recurrent Learning (HDRL) framework that bridges this gap by synergizing model-based optimal control with data-driven learning in a novel way. The core of HDRL is a hybrid training strategy: the policy is evaluated by rolling out on the actual uncertain system (forward pass), while the policy gradient is computed by backpropagating through a deterministic nominal model (backward pass). This approach creates a low-variance, model-guided policy gradient, a fundamental departure from high-variance model-free estimators. Architecturally, HDRL employs a recurrent neural network-like structure, repurposing the LQR cost as a self-supervised loss. A key enabler is our method to convert both additive and structured uncertainties into an additive signal, making training feasible without knowledge of the perturbed dynamics. Simulations demonstrate that HDRL provides a robust, sample-efficient, and practical solution for optimal control under uncertainty."

Existing vision-based methods struggle with maintaining consistent head-body associations and minimizing repeated alerts for non-compliant workers. To address these limitations, this paper makes three key contributions: first, we construct a novel safety wear dataset comprising 18,933 images with explicit head-body binding relationships, addressing a critical gap in existing public datasets; second, we propose an Attention-based Multi-Anchor Object Detection (AMAOD) algorithm that simultaneously detects body and head information while automatically establishing binding relationships between them; third, we introduce a Multimodal Fusion Hierarchical Sample Matching (MHSM) mechanism that enhances the importance of head information in occluded scenarios through vision-text feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves over 3% improvement in mAP, precision, and recall compared to baseline methods, while reducing ID switches by 68.8% and repeated alarm rates from 15.4% to 4.1% in tracking scenarios. To promote further research in this field, we will make our dataset publicly available upon acceptance of this paper."

However, prolonged exposure to electrical and environmental stresses accelerates its degradation, necessitating continuous improvements in formulation. The conventional One Factor at a Time (OFAT) method is both material-intensive and time-consuming, limiting optimization efficiency. This study employs a Two-Level Full Factorial Design of Experiments (DoE) to systematically analyse and optimize multiple factors affecting SiR performance. Four key parameters were investigated: Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) filler concentration, Dicumyl Peroxide (DCP) curing agent concentration, mixing speed, and mixing time. The resistance to electrical tracking and erosion was evaluated by monitoring leakage current (LC) during the Inclined Plane Tracking (IPT) test in accordance with BS EN IEC 60587:2022. Statistical tools including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), effect lists, Pareto charts, and half-normal plots were applied to assess factor significance and interactions. Regression modelling and 3D surface plots were used for predictive analysis and visualization. Results revealed that both individual factors and interactions significantly influenced SiR performance (p < 0.05). The optimized formulation of 50 pphr ATH, 0.5 pphr DCP, 70 rpm mixing speed, and 10 min mixing time achieved a desirability score with a Process Capability Index (Cpk) of 2.14, indicating a robust and reproducible process. Complementary analyses, including tracking depth, erosion length, weight loss, tensile strength, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), validated the findings. Increased mixing time reduced weight loss by 0.036%, whereas higher DCP content increased weight loss by 0.0405%. The optimized samples with the lowest LC exhibited superior chemical stability, improved surface morphology, and enhanced mechanical strength. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of DoE in optimizing both material formulation and processing parameters for SiR, providing valuable insights into mitigating HV insulation failures. By minimizing redundant experimentation, the approach supports more sustainable development of polymeric insulation technologies."

    "abstract": "Multi-view myocardial infarction (MI) detection often relies on electrocardiogram (ECG) data, which suffers from noise sensitivity and limited early diagnostic value. Echocardiography provides richer temporal-spatial information but frequently encounters missing views due to clinical acquisition constraints. Existing fusion methods typically adopt static or overly complex dynamic weighting, limiting their adaptability to varying view quality and hindering real-time applicability. To this end, this paper proposes a view completion method based on a dual-branch gating structure, combining Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN) to complete incomplete multi-view information. Specifically, the model uses the Transformer encoder to model global temporal dependencies, introduces GNN to strengthen the local structural relationship between views, and uses the gating mechanism to achieve collaborative completion of the aforementioned two core components. Furthermore, this paper designs an uncertainty-driven dynamic weighted fusion strategy based on Dirichlet distribution, which can adaptively adjust the fusion weights according to the prediction confidence of each view, overcoming the limitations of traditional static weighting. Experiments on the HMC-QU dataset show that the proposed method achieves 92.31% accuracy, 90.00% precision, and 100.00% specificity, outperforming state-of-the-art models and demonstrating strong potential for clinical deployment."

    "abstract": "A key challenge in registering pre- and post-operative brain tumor images lies in the anatomical inconsistencies caused by pathological changes and surgical resections. Recent efforts have addressed this issue by masking affected regions during optimization, but such approaches discard contextual information and rely on CNN backbones that implicitly model deformation, often overfitting to distant normal tissues and failing to capture the severe nonlinear distortions near the tumor. Correlation-based alternatives enhance generalization to diverse deformation patterns by explicitly modeling geometric correspondences, yet they frequently yield unreliable matches in and around tumor regions, disrupting the deformation field. In this paper, we propose Cross-correlation Rectification-based Registration Network (CRRNet), the first framework that introduces an active rectification mechanism specifically for robustness and structurally coherent pre- to post-operative brain tumor image registration. Specifically, CRRNet achieves this through two complementary modules: 1) a Cross-correlation Analysis-Based Inconsistency module that identifies invalid correspondences via bidirectional loop-closure evaluation on cross-correlations, and 2) a Dual-level Correspondence Rectification module that adaptively integrates contextually reliable correlations from local and long-range perspectives to restore structurally coherent matches. This synergistic design retains the strengths of cross-correlation while effectively mitigating correspondence mismatches. Extensive experiments on multiple tumor benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of CRRNet. Specifically, on the BraTS-Reg dataset, it reduces the mean registration errors by 8.18% in near-tumor regions and 3.95% in far-from-tumor regions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of medical information technology promotes the popularization of telemedicine. With remote transmission of patient archives, medical institutions can provide more efficient diagnostic service. Because of the highly sensitive nature of medical data, medical archives typically require the support of encryption to prevent leakage of patient privacy. However, the encrypted archives visually appear as snowflake-like noise, which is easily perceived by an attacker and thus appealing to the crack. In this paper, we propose an imperceptible medical archive construction scheme, which can hide personal medical data in a high-capacity customizable cover image, thus making it impossible for attackers to perceive its presence. Specifically, we first conduct a fusion of multimodal medical image data, integrating image information from various imaging techniques into a unified image, thereby enhancing diagnostic efficacy. Secondly, a high-capacity customizable cover image is generated based on the patient facial mask. Lastly, the unified image with patient demographic information is hidden in the cover image to construct the imperceptible medical archive. To enhance the hiding capacity of the cover image, we propose a Collaborative Steganography Generation Model (CSGM), which increases the low-frequency components during image synthesis, enabling more data to be embedded while maintaining high visual quality. CSGM also supports identity-aware customization using facial structure and semantic text. Experiments show that CSGM improves the PSNR of stego images by 6.95 dB and the PSNR of recovered secret images by 2.98 dB compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness in imperceptibility and data recovery."

    "abstract": "Object detection in remote sensing imagery is challenging because targets often appear at markedly different scales and may become visually similar when the image resolution varies. A key advantage of remote sensing imagery is that each image provides a ground sample distance (GSD) value linking pixel units to real-world size, offering physical cues that can mitigate such scale-induced ambiguity. While recent methods have attempted to exploit GSD, many rely on additional subnetworks or heuristic weighting and still fail to capture category-specific size characteristics. To address this, we propose a lightweight module, Pixels-to-Meters Prior Fusion (P2M-PF), which integrates physical-size priors into the classification branch without altering the detection architecture. Experiments on the GSD-labelled subset of DOTA v1.0 demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, with notable gains for categories susceptible to cross-scale confusion."

We use STM with real-time job postings data to discover in-demand GAIS and estimate the labor market premium associated with these skills. We illustrate the proposed framework using a large corpus of generative AI job postings to identify the ten most salient GAIS. Further, we show how skill identification can be conditioned on specific job characteristics, such as required experience or job location. Finally, we demonstrate how the STM framework can be used as a decision-support system, providing practical insights into various real-world decisions faced by engineering management professionals and organizations. Theoretically, our study contributes to the engineering management literature by operationalizing a dynamic capabilities approach to workforce agility. Practically, it provides an evidence-based tool for engineering managers to guide workforce development and hiring strategies using real-time labor market insights.

    "abstract": "Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose automated neural architecture design (AutoNAD), an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multilayer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. In addition, a searchable multilevel feature aggregation module is integrated to enhance multiscale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform."

The Inception module excels at extracting salient, multi-scale local features from the Doppler data, while the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network subsequently models the long-range temporal dependencies inherent in complex human activities. To further enhance classification performance, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a non-linear kernel is integrated as a post-processing stage. This step refines the decision boundaries learned by the deep neural network, significantly improving generalization. The proposed methodology achieves outstanding accuracy rates approaching 99 % in identifying distinct human movements.

Spectrograms are widely adopted in this domain for capturing spectral-temporal features, but annotated datasets are scarce due to the high cost and expertise required for labeling. This work investigates the self-supervised learning (SSL) method called Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) for spectral representation learning targeting pixel-wise segmentation of mobile communication RF spectrograms. Although BYOL has been explored in natural images, audio, and satellite imagery, its application to mobile communication spectrograms remains unexplored. A ResNet-50 backbone was pre-trained using BYOL with various augmentations (including those proposed in the original BYOL paper) on spectrograms from four different datasets containing real and synthetic RF signals of different wireless technologies, such as Radar, WiFi, LTE, and NR. Full finetuning on the test dataset achieves competitive performance with substantially less data in the pretraining phase when compared to a model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. The results clearly indicate that BYOL-pretrained models outperform the fromscratch baseline in all dataset size regimes, and in the few-shot learning regime, they even outperform the ImageNet-pretrained model. The backbones were also evaluated quantitatively via linear readout with limited supervision. Models pretrained on RF data with BYOL outperform ImageNet-1k V2 in the few-shot regime, highlighting their strong generalization capacity under scarce labeled data. These findings demonstrate the potential of this SSL technique for efficient and robust detection of mobile communication technology, particularly with limited available labeled data."

    "abstract": "Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores, MIDI, and audio. Translations between such modalities are established as core tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription (audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score). However, most past work on multimodal translation utilizes specialized models trained for each translation task. In this paper, we propose a unified framework based on a common tokenization strategy. We use dedicated separate models for the Image-to-Audio and Audio-to-Image directions, sharing an identical encoder-decoder architecture to handle each task within a coherent framework. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new large-scale dataset, and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into a sequence of tokens, enabling standard encoder-decoder Transformers to tackle multiple crossmodal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results confirm that our unified framework improves upon single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%, while also seeing substantial improvements across the other translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first musically-coherent score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in cross-modal music generation."

Consequently, the market share of three-terminal MLCCs and Si capacitors is rising due to their low equivalent series inductances (ESLs). In this study, we fabricate multilayer thin-film capacitors (MLTCs) using thin-film processes. These capacitors include AlN (paraelectric) and Mo/Ti electrodes, which have a thickness of 30 nm and are composed of 80 or 247 layers. Furthermore, their capacitances are 17 or 43 nF, and their ESLs are approximately 30 pH, considerably lower than normal MLCCs (83 pH). However, the occurrence of wrinkles caused by the surface roughness during the stacking process complicates the fabrication of MLTCs. In addition, the etching technology for dielectrics and electrode materials requires improvement to remove by-products effectively. Therefore, this research introduces possible fabrication processes for MLTCs and measures their various characteristics as capacitors. Furthermore, we verify the potential of MLTCs for high-density, low-ESL capacitors in advanced electronic circuits operating at higher frequencies and compare the results with those of other capacitors, including Si capacitors. The study confirms that MLTCs offer superior capacitance compared to Si capacitors, rendering them potential candidates for high-frequency communication modules and compact electronic devices."

    "abstract": "Current deep learning methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aircraft detection typically rely on single-temporal, high-resolution imagery, requiring extensive labeled datasets and limiting generalization across sensors and resolutions. Meanwhile, abundant multi-temporal, coarse- and moderate-resolution SAR images from satellites such as Sentinel-1, offering valuable temporal cues about stable aircraft positions at designated parking stands, remain largely underutilized. Additionally, existing techniques inadequately exploit the complementary advantages of multi-resolution SAR data, overlooking the synergy between global context from coarse imagery and detailed localization from fine-resolution imagery. To bridge this gap, we propose the hierarchical prior transfer approach (HiPTA), a novel framework for synergistic fusion of multi-temporal and multi-resolution SAR data in a coarse-to-fine detection paradigm. First, the coarse-resolution multi-temporal prior extraction (CMPE) module mines low-resolution time series to identify robust parking-stand priors. Next, the intermediate-resolution prior fusion and refinement (IPFR) and hierarchical multi-resolution prior registration (HMPR) modules align and refine these priors across intermediate and high-resolution domains, drastically narrowing the search space. Finally, the Fine-Resolution Aircraft Detection (FRAD) module employs a domain-adaptive frequency-adaptive filtering network to classify candidate regions in high-resolution imagery. Extensive experiments on multi-source C- and Ku-band SAR datasets show that HiPTA consistently improves precision–recall trade-offs and maintains robustness across sensors and resolutions, delivering consistent gains over single-resolution detectors and airport-detection-aided methods."

    "abstract": "Well-designed and trained deep neural networks can solve inverse electromagnetic problems much faster than conventional solvers. However, they need a physics framework to ensure producing physically correct results. Since most physics-guided deep learning inverse solvers require substantial training with numerous epochs, each involving solving a forward problem, their accuracy and efficiency are largely defined by the utilized forward solver, which becomes a bottleneck for their practical training. Thus, a fast and accurate self-supervised deep learning forward solver is presented. The solver uses a physics-based framework that divides the domain into two regions: an interior region, which includes any scatterers, and an exterior region, which represents the background medium. A hybrid loss function, incorporating Maxwell’s curl equation and integral equation with the well-defined scalar background’s Green’s function, is employed to guide the scattered field generated from the neural network, ensuring global and local accuracy. To verify the generality of the solver, it is trained on random objects and tested on realistic models, showing high global and local metrics accuracy. For example, more than 95% of testing cases using the proposed method achieve less than 0.15 root-mean-square error in the calculated scattered field and dielectric properties of the imaged domain compared to the ground truth. In contrast, two recent deep learning methods could only realize that level of accuracy for less than 50% of the tested cases. The reported method is 97% faster than conventional solvers, enabling the development of reliable deep-learning inverse solvers."

To address these issues, we propose three different distribution scenarios of labeled data and construct a general semi-supervised framework. Furthermore, to enhance the guidance efficacy of limited labeled data, we innovatively employ prototype space optimization to strengthen the model's discriminative capability under low-resource scenarios.

However, their high pour point limits use in cold regions, and aging products formed during long-term operation further degrade performance. Liquid crystal additives show promise for enhancing low-temperature fluidity and thermal stability. Among them, 4'-Ethoxybenzylidene-4-butylaniline (EBBA) exhibits strong polarity-driven interactions, yet its mechanism with aging products in natural esters remains unclear. In this study, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to elucidate the interactions between EBBA and four representative aging products—water, methanol, formic acid, and acetic acid. Hydrogen bonds were identified using a donor–acceptor distance criterion of ≤ 2.4 Å. DFT calculations with Basis Set Superposition Error (BSSE) correction indicated that the nitrogen atom of EBBA forms the strongest interaction with formic acid (−12.40 kcal/mol). MD simulations further revealed that EBBA enhances the hydrogen-bond network in all systems. Under the applied electric field, the hydrogen-bond number increases by 6.55% in the water system, by 16.62% in the methanol system, and by 10.78% and 9.12% in the formic acid and acetic acid systems, respectively. Meanwhile, the diffusion coefficients of all aging-product molecules exhibit significant reductions, indicating suppressed molecular mobility. These results clarify the molecular mechanism by which EBBA regulates aging product migration, providing theoretical support for designing low-pour-point natural ester insulating oils and optimizing liquid crystal additive applications."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a knowledge graph construction framework based on news articles to facilitate effective road-accident information management. The implementation of the proposed framework included three main stages. First, the news articles containing the keyword ‘traffic accident’ were collected, retaining only those that contain detailed accident description. Second, to effectively handle linguistic variations and ambiguities, large language models with chain-of-thought prompting were employed to extract structured accident information from news texts. Third, semantic embeddings were utilized to analyze similarities among accidents, thereby creating “SimilarTo” relationships to gain deeper insights and support enhanced analytical capabilities. The structured data thus obtained were converted into a knowledge graph (KG). Using the Neo4j graph database, a KG was constructed to represent traffic accidents that occurred in Korea during 2022. The practical relevance of the KG was verified through complex query tests across seven different scenarios with diverse combinations of entities and relationships. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively structured detailed accident-related information extracted from news articles, demonstrating its potential to augment data sources for accident management, analysis and decision-making."

    "abstract": "Code smell detection is critical for maintaining software quality and enabling effective refactoring, yet much prior work identifies only one smell at a time. This single-label framing misses the real-world complexity where a code element can exhibit multiple co-occurring smells. We address this gap by creating a unified multi-label dataset that combines four existing datasets at two levels—method-level and class-level—covering Long Method (LM), Feature Envy (FE), God Class (GC), and Data Class (DC). Our approach models correlations (co-occurrence) among these smells and links them to Feature Importance analyses to identify the metrics that drive each label. We evaluate three multi-label strategies—Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, and Classifier Chains—paired with Decision Tree and Random Forest.We used a 5-fold stratified cross-validation for each single-level dataset. To prevent data leakage, we implemented a 5-fold GroupKFold for the unified dataset, along with an in-fold grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Performance is reported via Jaccard, Hamming Loss, and Exact Match. On the unified Truth-only dataset, Classifier Chains with Random Forest achieves the highest Jaccard (0.3351), while Binary Relevance with Random Forest attains the lowest Hamming Loss (0.0288) and the highest Exact Match (0.8847). Overall, the unified dataset enables simultaneous detection of multiple smells in one model and protocol, reveals where inter-label correlations are informative (LM–FE) and where they are not (GC–DC), and maintains distribution properties for fair comparison, yielding results that are more realistic and easier to reuse."

    "abstract": "DNA-based data storage has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional media due to its ultra-high information density and long-term stability. However, the high read cost caused by the error-prone synthesis, storage, and sequencing processes remains a major bottleneck for practical deployment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a read-cost-efficient coding framework that enhances reliability without increasing total redundancy. First, a novel two-layer intra-oligo coding scheme based on Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) codes is presented, where index bits and data bits are respectively protected to mitigate base-level errors. Second, a semi-analytical optimization method based on the normal approximation of the finite-length coding rate is developed to allocate redundancy between index and data bits optimally under a fixed total code rate. The inter-oligo protection is further achieved through low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes to combat sequence-level errors.We then present extensive analytical and numerical results to show the effectiveness of the proposed analysis. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate that the concatenated code based on the optimized two-layer coding scheme significantly outperforms the concatenated code based on the single-layer coding scheme in terms of frame error rate (FER) under the same sequencing depth and total redundancy. These results underscore the advantages of the two-layer coding scheme and the optimization method for DNA-based data storage systems."

Four-point resistance measurements were used to readout the bilayer samples at 4.2 K. Bilayers aged in a vacuum generally saw no change or a slight increase in resistance, while bilayers aged in nitrogen gas decreased in resistance. Finally, we conclude with a comparative overview of all test results on prototype arrays and TES bilayers, elaborate on possible mechanisms for the observed shifts in characteristics, and make recommendations for maintaining the long-term stability of our devices."

    "abstract": "In a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverter, achieving uniform power distribution across modules remains a well-known challenge. The commonly used level-shifted carrier pulse width modulation (LSPWM) results in a wide disparity in the power distribution between modules, leading to premature failures in over-stressed modules. Two new Carrier Reassignment PWM (CRPWM) techniques (Type-A and Type-B) improve upon these shortcomings for operation over the full power factor range with minimal computational overhead and can be easily integrated into existing control schemes. This paper presents the complete hardware implementation and performance validation of Type-A and Type-B carrier reassignment PWM techniques, along with FIFO-CRPWM and LSPWM under identical conditions for comparison. A 9-level CHB inverter prototype is built and operated in closed-loop grid-connected mode with synchronous reference-frame based control (dq control) over the entire power factor range, from unity power factor (UPF), down to zero power factor (ZPF). The real and reactive power delivered by each module is measured for each operating condition to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes. The carrier reassignments are also formulated as generalized matrix transformations suitable for fast digital implementation with an inexpensive device such as a Programmable Logic Device (PLD) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)."

Assessing proposed solutions in simulated environments that closely approximate real-world network behavior is crucial to mitigate potential risks during deployment. This work aims to extend the capabilities of the “ns3-oran” module in the “ns-3” network simulator. The new functionalities remove restrictions on the type of data that can be exchanged with the Near-RT RIC (Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller), thereby increasing flexibility for researchers and developers. The ability to collect, store, and analyze heterogeneous data is a key enabler for the design and integration of machine learning-based solutions into the RAN. With these enhancements, the simulator can support the creation of scenarios tailored to reinforcement learning (RL) training, leveraging performance metrics that were previously inaccessible or non-configurable within ns-3. As a result, the proposed “ns3-oran-customizable-db” provides a more powerful simulation environment for advancing AI-driven RAN control and optimization approaches."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning, deep recommendation models have achieved remarkable improvements in recommendation accuracy. However, due to the large number of candidate items in practice and the high cost of preference computation, these methods still suffer from low recommendation efficiency. The recently proposed tree-based deep recommendation models alleviate the problem by directly learning tree structure and representations under the guidance of recommendation objectives. To guarantee the effectiveness of beam search for recommendation accuracy, these models strive to ensure that the tree adheres to the max-heap assumption, where a parent node's preference should be the maximum among its children's preferences. However, they employ a one- versus-all strategy, framing the training task as a series of independent binary classification objectives for each node, which limits their ability to fully satisfy the max-heap assumption. To this end, we propose a Deep Tree-based Retriever (DTR for short) for efficient recommendation. DTR frames the training task as a softmax-based multi-class classification over tree nodes at the same level, enabling explicit horizontal competition and more discriminative top-k selection among them, which mimics the beam search behavior during training. To mitigate the suboptimality induced by the labeling of non-leaf nodes, we propose a rectification method for the loss function, which further aligns with the max-heap assumption in expectation. As the number of tree nodes grows exponentially with the levels, we employ sampled softmax to approximate optimization and thereby enhance efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a tree-based sampling method to reduce the bias inherent in sampled softmax. Theoretical results reveal DTR's generalization capability, and both the rectification method and tree-based sampling contribute to improved generalization. The experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly advanced promptable image segmentation in computer vision. However, extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper, we introduce SAM-I2V++, a training-efficient image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception, (ii) a memory selective associator that retrieves the most relevant past frames via similarity-driven selection and uses multiscale-enhanced cross-attention to associate selected memory features with the current frame, and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 93% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and enabling broader applications and advancements in the field.

I.e., due to devices sharing model parameters (or logits) by following a consensus protocol, the convergence performance of decentralized FL algorithms is affected by the network topology. In case the network topology dynamically changes, the existing solutions may fail. In this work, we investigate a topology control technique in the design of the consensus protocol. Using the strategy as a building block, we develop upon knowledge distillation a decentralized framework for heterogeneous FL, dubbed as DistHFL. By conducting the consensus process on a connected dominating set associated subnetwork rather than the whole network, and updating the subnetwork towards topology change, the DistHFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the model learning algorithm and enhances its robustness against dynamic topology. We develop mathematical models to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed consensus protocol, as well as the convergence of the DistHFL. We derive an upper bound for the generalization performance of the ensemble models trained with DistHFL by applying the domain measurement tools. Through conducting extensive numerical experiments, we verify that DistHFL outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms under all setups in all cases."

It is shown for the first time that the virtual output impedance-targeted false data injection attack is capable of destabilizing the autonomous microgrid, especially when the distribution lines' X/R ratio is sufficiently low. Through small-signal modeling, the low-frequency oscillations and stability margin are comprehensively characterized, providing a theoretical basis for designing resilience-enhancing virtual output impedance controls against false data injection attacks. This method can provide additional damping to microgrids with any low X/R ratio, ensuring an adequate stability margin. To simplify the small-signal model for design analysis, the work adopted the assumptions of light and high-power factor loads, as well as small voltage-angle variations across the microgrid network. A design guideline that considers the damping ratio and the diminishing-return nature of the stabilizing effect provided by the virtual inductance has been developed. The proposed modeling, attack analysis, and resilience-enhancing techniques are comprehensively demonstrated and validated on a two-DER microgrid through simulations and experiments. It is shown that the enhanced virtual output impedance control successfully improves the resilience of the microgrid against false data injection attacks, suppressing low-frequency oscillations and maintaining grid stability."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are generated by introducing imperceptible perturbations to clean images, leading to misclassification. The existing untargeted attack usually only focuses on weakening the original class when generating adversarial examples, ignoring the model’s prediction distribution for other classes. Based on the analysis of the attention heatmap of model decision and the existing adversarial attack results, we find that the high-confidence negative classes of the images often reflect the natural weak directions in the model decision, and updating the adversarial examples along this direction is more likely to help it deviate from the original class. Therefore, we propose an untargeted adversarial example generation method via Negative Class Guidance (NCG). First, the logits of the clean image are extracted according to the classification confidence. Second, the soft label is generated via smoothing and normalization operations. Finally, a novel loss function is derived that integrates negative class information with the soft label to guide the update direction of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that NCG substantially enhances the adversarial transferability of state-of-the-art attack methodologies on both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), highlighting its effectiveness in black-box attack scenarios."

However, it is still a challenging task to maintain data privacy while enhancing model performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving and incentive-driven FL framework, called IMPPFL (Privacy Preserving Federated Learning Based on Incentive Mechanism), which combines incentive mechanisms and non-interactive verifiable secure aggregation technology to safeguard data security within IoT ITS. The proposed scheme is based on differential privacy, which can dynamically adjust noise levels before sharing the model, thus ensuring robust security and privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only enhances model convergence and accuracy compared to baseline methods but also effectively ensures robust privacy and security guarantees. On the MNIST dataset, IMPPFL achieved 96% accuracy after 50 rounds, outperforming baseline methods like VREFL and HFL. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, it reached 89% accuracy under the same conditions. The framework required fewer training epochs to reach target accuracy. In addition, the scheme can effectively deter malicious client manipulative actions while improving the accuracy and security of the global model. IMPPFL effectively enhances model accuracy, ensures robust privacy guarantees, and incentivizes high-quality client participation, making it a viable solution for secure and efficient federated learning in intelligent transportation systems."

Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) effectively enhances the real-time data processing capability by sinking computing power to the network edge. However, the heterogeneity of MEC devices brings complex security challenges, such as risks of information leakage and privacy infringement, and it is urgent to build an efficient identity authentication mechanism to ensure system security. Nevertheless, the existing identity-based and physical unclonable function-based identity verification protocols show limitations, such as inability to ensure anonymity and non-reproducibility, vulnerability to the impact of challenge responses pairs on leakage, and susceptibility to various attacks caused by temporary secret leakage and key leakage. To address these issues, this paper proposes a PUF-enhanced lightweight three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol named PUF3FAka tailored for MEC environments. For the first time, CRO-PUF resilient to machine learning attacks is integrated with a fuzzy-verification mechanism into a three-factor authentication framework. Without storing any challenge–response pairs (CRPs) on the server side, the protocol eliminates the risk of CRPs leakage attacks from the root. The design satisfies ten edge-computing security evaluation criteria and withstands various attacks such as offline password guessing, ephemeral-secret leakage attacks and key-compromise impersonation attacks. Performance evaluations demonstrate that PUF3FAka outperforms existing protocols by 82.86% in computational cost and 96.7% in communication overhead on average, making it well suited for resource-constrained IoT terminals and edge servers."

    "abstract": "A method for detecting small leaks in gas pipelines based on semi-supervised learning is proposed. The proposed method models the time-varying behavior of signals collected from a flexible acoustic emission (AE) sensor that is attached on a gas pipe to classify between normal and leak states. Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) is adopted to model the temporal behavior of the AE sensor. GHMM is suitable for processing noise-prone AE signals because its probabilistic approach enables discrimination between normal and abnormal states even in presence of background noise. Furthermore, GHMM can be trained using only normal data in a semi-supervised way to solve the problem related to collecting abnormal data. The proposed method uses a feature extractor that divides the AE signal into multiple segments and then extracts the characteristics of each segment using an ensemble technique. The proposed method is capable to detect small gas leaks within a pipeline from signals acquired by a flexible AE sensor that is vulnerable to noise. The performance of the proposed method was verified using a dataset collected from a testbed that can simulate actual gas pipe leaks."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -based visible light communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising option for 6G scenarios due to its ability to exploit unlicensed optical bandwidth while enabling high spectral efficiency (SE) and flexible allocation of subcarriers (SCs). Nevertheless, the transmission performance of such systems is often restricted by nonlinear distortions originating from optoelectronic components, which constrain the achievable quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) order. In this work, we establish an SE-enhanced red light-emitting diode-based OFDM-VLC transmission system with high-level QAM orders enabled by employing a high-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and a linear wideband power amplifier (PA). To further reduce PA-induced nonlinear distortion, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoding is applied to lower the signal peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Large-size FFT in combination with the intra-symbol frequency averaging (ISFA) technique is utilized to provide accurate channel estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the optimized DAC output current and ISFA taps, up to a 512-QAM DFT-precoded OFDM signal with a record single-wavelength SE of 8.1 b/s/Hz can be successfully transmitted over 1.2-m free-space transmission with the bit error rate below 20% soft-decision forward error correction threshold of 2.4×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>."

    "abstract": "The dedicated dual-panel breast PET scanner (B-PET) can potentially provide improved imaging of breast lesions with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity and lower scanner costs. On the other hand, the dual-panel systems suffer from spatially-variant deformations, due to the limited angular sampling and parallax errors, that need to be mitigated in order to improve visualization and quantification of the breast lesions. Our previous studies demonstrated that the deep-learning approach can significantly reduce spatially-variant deformations in the context of B-PET. However, these studies used only simplified geometric objects with a uniform background for training and testing, which does not fully represent the clinical complexity in breast PET imaging. In this work, we developed a methodology for generation of synthetic clinical-like breast images with complex lesion shapes, including spiculated lesions and following tracer-dependent activity characteristics for 18FFES and 18FFDG. Subsequently, the neural network was trained and tested on clinical-like synthetic B-PET data reconstructed using statistical iterative reconstruction (DIRECT-RAMLA) used as the network input. Our results show that the deep learning approach can substantially suppress deformations for both small lesions and the larger phantom itself in dual-panel PET reconstructions. The deep learning approach can also improve quantitative measurements in terms of the lesion contrast metrics and image roughness over the phantom background. A research 18FFES patient study further confirms the improved visual image quality and a good visual correlation for a heterogeneous lesion with the total body PET imaging result."

Inspired by these ideas, this work discusses the utilization of FMs, especially multi-modal FMs in wireless networks. We focus on two important types of tasks in wireless network management: prediction tasks and control tasks. In particular, we first discuss FMs-enabled multi-modal contextual information understanding in wireless networks. Then, we explain how FMs can be applied to prediction and control tasks, respectively. Following this, we introduce the development of wireless-specific FMs from two perspectives: available datasets for development and the methodologies used.

The novelty of this work lies in its comprehensive approach, which includes detailed network and unit representations, individual and system harmonic limits, and a variety of fairness criteria for equitable distribution of the available harmonic budget. The proposed method employs both non-linear and second-order cone models to analyze harmonic power flows, ensuring accurate and tractable solutions. Numerical illustrations show that the second-order cone relaxation approach, determines the harmonic hosting capacity lower bound in an exact and tractable way. The practical applicability of the approach is demonstrated on the Rte 1888 bus system, where the effects of the different fairness criteria and system wide harmonic limits are discussed. The optimization model is made available an open-source software package for further research and practical application in power system planning."

    "abstract": "Cognitive radar enhances traditional radar systems by equipping them with the ability to sense, understand, learn, reason, and make decisions, thus enabling these systems to adapt to increasingly complex and dynamic electromagnetic environments. This adaptive capability significantly improves radar performance in specific missions, including target detection, tracking, and recognition. However, despite its promising potential, cognitive radar is still in the early stages of development, transitioning from theoretical concepts to practical implementation, with many foundational theories and technologies remaining underdeveloped. Current works are primarily focused on optimizing waveforms under the assumption of prior knowledge, often overlooking a comprehensive and practical perspective of radar systems. These approaches lead to challenges such as overly idealistic assumptions, difficulties in obtaining prior knowledge, and the complexity of waveform diversity schemes and design algorithms. To advance the practical application of cognitive radar systems, this paper addresses key issues in two critical domains: clutter suppression and jamming countermeasures. We propose solutions based on cognitive radar, focusing on the development of the required hardware systems for these tasks and the design of their closed-loop operation processes. Experimental results, derived from actual measurement data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in both clutter suppression and jamming countermeasures."

In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning algorithm named EF21-MP (EF21 with Momentum and Partial Participation), which combines biased compression with partial participation and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, it incorporates momentum and EF21 to reduce variance from stochastic gradient descent and biased compression. It achieves convergence for nonconvex optimization under standard smoothness and bounded variance conditions, without relying on any bounded gradient assumptions, and could support for batch-free training. The numerical results demonstrate that EF21-MP consistently outperforms the existing baselines."

    "abstract": "In modern naval warfare, effectively responding to complex threats involving multiple simultaneous targets has become increasingly important. To address this need, this study proposes a practical simulation framework designed explicitly for composite warfare scenarios involving next-generation naval ships. Specifically, the framework emphasizes simultaneous threat evaluation and dynamic weapon allocation. The proposed framework comprises three major components: (1) combat entity models—including warships, aircraft, missiles, and launchers—along with their interactions; (2) a simulation timeline that chronologically represents combat engagements; and (3) a discrete-event line highlighting critical engagement events. To accurately capture the hierarchical and modular nature of combat entities, the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism is adopted, mathematically modeling combat systems as discrete-event hierarchical structures. A distinctive methodological contribution of the proposed DEVS framework is the explicit representation of weapon assignment logic through state transitions, with decision-making times modeled as state transition durations. Additionally, the resource control function is structurally separated within the command and fire control system, enabling efficient parallel responses to multiple threats. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this simulation framework, we conducted a detailed case study involving a composite warfare scenario with one alliance warship confronting 16 enemy platforms. Simulation experiments confirmed that explicitly quantifying timing effects improved participation efficiency by 2% to 7%. This demonstrates the framework's ability to address the limitation of insufficient decision cycle sensitivity analysis in recent CFCS research. Thus, the proposed framework offers valuable insights and practical implications for developing next-generation naval combat systems optimized for composite warfare."

Due to their low complexity, InO cores have been widely used in situations where energy efficiency and small circuit area are required, but they provide limited performance. We focus on stalls in InO cores that are caused by load instructions and their consumer instructions. These stalls significantly degrade the performance, which accounts for 70% of the total execution time on SPEC CPU 2017. We found that many of these load instructions are ready to execute and could have been issued earlier. Based on this observation, we propose Inspex, which improves the performance of InO cores while maintaining its simplicity. Inspex predicts ready-to-execute loads and speculatively pre-executes them. This enables obtaining load results earlier, thereby removing the stalls caused by load consumers. Our simulation results show that Inspex improved the performance by 25.6% and reduced the energy consumption by 10.6%, and reduced the energy-delay product by 28.0% compared with a baseline InO core while incurring an area overhead of 0.65%."

Next, the temporal evolution trend and spatial distribution pattern of PET were analyzed. And then our product was compared with existing products. Results indicate that: (1) Annual and seasonal PET exhibited a V-shaped evolutionary trend. (2) Spatially, PET was lower in China's central and western regions, but higher in surrounding areas.

First, a three-dimensional physical model is constructed based on the manufacturing parameters of FOT. The photon transmission model is used to simulate the propagation behavior of rays in the optical system. Second, the collimated and diffuse light sources are both considered to obtain transmittance data of FOT models with different physical parameters and the models are also built to analyze the effects of taper ratio, length, and refractive index difference on transmittance. Finally, the relationship between the waist curve and distribution of photon loss is constructed. The simulation results indicate that the photon loss during internal transmission of FOT with a linear waist is 69.49% greater than that with a curved waist. The photon loss distribution is related to the slope of waist tangent, and the sudden change in tangent slope at boundary of base and taper regions can lead to an increase in photon loss."

The novelty of this method lies in the design of the TFVS, which accurately estimates lateral tire forces using conventional sensors, circumventing control failures caused by simplified tire models. The TFVS algorithm comprises two stages: first, an initial estimator is designed using the backstepping method and an adaptive second-order sliding mode (ASOSM) observer; second, the initial estimates are treated as noisy measurements, and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to fuse these with model-based predictions, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy and suppressing oscillations. Building on this foundation, an all-in-one path-tracking control framework is proposed, consisting of four components. The core controller employs input-output feedback linearization-based model predictive control (IOFL-MPC) to obtain intermediate control variables for tracking the ideal lateral velocity and yaw rate generated by the ideal state generator. The remaining components convert these intermediate control variables into actual control commands to achieve the overall control objectives. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed strategy are validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments."

    "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) have shown considerable momentum in ongoing energy transition in global context. However, as the MGs progressively evolve into the configuration of MGs community, power congestion as well as complex power flow distribution inside hybrid ac/dc MGs community inevitably compromise efficient holistic system operations. Conventional approaches rely on interlinking converters to regulate power flow, but these systems operate under fully rated power schemes, leading to low efficiency and high cost. This article proposes a novel energy storage (ES)-based power lever (ES-PL), intending to transform the interlinking architecture of hybrid ac/dc MGs community. ES-PL is derived from a partially rated power scheme which gives rise to less power loss and saves system capital cost. By means of ES-PL, an interplexed global power sharing scheme is proposed to manipulate the power flow within the hybrid system such that entire system loads can be proportionally shared by all MGs. A complete dynamic model is carefully established, and the guidelines of key control parameter selection are presented based on comprehensive small signal stability analyses. The effectiveness of proposed ES-PL as well as its corresponding control strategy are verified by hardware experimentation."

    "abstract": "With the continuous advancement of urbanization, the importance of building change detection in urban planning, disaster management, and other fields has become increasingly prominent. However, existing change detection methods still have significant limitations in spatial domain difference feature representation and multi-scale difference capture. To address this, we propose a novel Differential-Feature Dynamic-Fusion Network (DF2Net), which aims to improve the accuracy of building change detection in remote sensing images. DF2Net achieves efficient detection of change areas through the collaborative design of three key modules: Differential-Feature Frequency-domain Attention Module (DFAM), Global-Local Feature Dynamic-Fusion Module (GFDM), and Pseudo-label Deep-supervision Module (PDM). Specifically, DFAM combines Fourier transform and self-attention mechanisms to extract key information from the frequency domain, thereby improving the feature representation of change areas. GFDM dynamically fuses global and local features to effectively capture multi-scale change information. PDM optimizes feature learning in the middle layer of the decoder by introducing pseudo-label supervision. Experimental results on three mainstream building change detection datasets, LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and HRCUS-CD, show that DF2Net significantly outperforms existing mainstream methods in both F1-score and IoU, demonstrating superior performance. This indicates that DF2Net has broad application prospects in handling complex scenarios and multi-scale change detection tasks. The code available from https://github.com/Mw-yang/DF2Net."

    "abstract": "Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue. For example, during mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill. The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we address this challenge by integrating a Microscopic Stereo Camera System (MSCS) into the robotic bone micro-milling system and proposing a novel online pre-measurement pipeline for the target surface. Starting from uncalibrated cameras, the pipeline enables automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting through a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based keypoint detection. Combined with the existing feedback-based system, we develop the world's first autonomous robotic bone micro-milling system capable of rapidly, in real-time perceiving and adapting to surface unevenness and non-uniform thickness, thereby enabling an end-to-end autonomous cranial window creation workflow without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7 % and an average milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and stability compared to human operators."

    "abstract": "In this study, Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose-stabilized selenium nanoparticles (HPMC-SeNPs) were successfully synthesized and utilized as a support for pepsin immobilization via glutaraldehyde crosslinking. Characterization through SEM, FTIR, and XRD confirmed their structural integrity, while zeta potential (−12.61 mV) and DLS (PDI: 0.1818) indicated good colloidal stability and uniform size distribution. The immobilized pepsin (HPMC/Se-Pep) demonstrated high immobilization efficiency (81.25%) and yield (78.73%). The enzymatic system exhibited enhanced stability over a wider pH (2–6) and temperature range (20–60 °C), with improved kinetic parameters—lower Km (0.16 mM) and higher Vmax (0.94 μmol/min)—indicating stronger substrate affinity and better catalytic performance than free pepsin. Functional assays revealed significantly enhanced caseinolytic and antimicrobial activities, with inhibition zones of 22 ± 0.05 mm (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S. aureus</i>) and 21 ± 0.12 mm (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E. coli</i>), outperforming both native NPs and free enzyme. Notably, the immobilized pepsin achieved complete removal of blood stains within 30–40 min and retained 60.2% of its activity after five reuse cycles, confirming excellent operational stability. However, a gradual decline in enzymatic activity was observed after repeated reuse and prolonged storage, indicating the need for further optimisation to enhance long-term stability. These results demonstrate that HPMC-SeNPs are an effective platform for enzyme immobilization, offering improved performance, reusability, and multifunctionality. The developed system holds strong potential for applications in biocatalysis, textile processing, and healthcare industries."

    "abstract": "In three-dimensional packaging architectures, the Through-Silicon Via-Redistributed Layer (TSV-RDL) interconnect structure serves as the critical conductive pathway and is continuously subjected to combined thermo-electric coupling loads, making it a vulnerable zone for electromigration failures. This research adopts a multidimensional methodology to analyze the influencing factors of electromigration in TSV-RDL. First, the study designs electromigration acceleration experiments based on the dual factors of temperature and current density to establish the time-varying resistance characteristic curves of the TSV-RDL. Second, scanning electron microscopy is employed to characterize the failure interfaces and to analyze the morphological differences between thermally dominant and electrically dominant failure modes. Finally, a thermal-electrical-mechanical multiphysics coupling model is constructed using the ANSYS Workbench platform. In conclusion, the study unequivocally demonstrates that the failure mechanisms in TSV-RDL structures are governed by two distinct regimes, dictated by the dominant driving force. The invariant locations of current crowding and stress concentration serve as inherent weaknesses of the structure. Crucially, the research establishes that the current-density-dominated regime leads to gradual, predictable degradation, whereas the temperature-dominated regime triggers rapid, catastrophic failure. These findings provide a critical foundation for designing reliable 3D integrations: by actively controlling the operational regime to favor current-density dominance, designers can significantly extend the interconnect lifespan. Furthermore, the identified failure hotspots offer precise targets for structural reinforcement and reliability monitoring."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in monostatic in-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems encounters significant challenges due to self-interference (SI) at the radar receiver during concurrent communication and radar operations. This paper proposes a novel waveform-domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) technique that leverages the unique properties of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) signals. The proposed approach designs the integrated dual-functionality frame to utilize OFDM for communication and AFDM for radar sensing, both generated using the same modulator block. Then, we establish the conditions under which a wide sense stationary (WSS) process in the time domain appears as WSS in the affine domain and demonstrate that the interfering OFDM signal behaves as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in this domain. Exploiting this property, the received signal is projected into the affine domain, where the SI appears as AWGN, enabling its subtraction with minimal residual interference. To further mitigate the residual SI, an iterative low-complexity windowing scheme is applied, selectively locking onto the radar signal to reduce the processed signal space. A subsequent time domain spreading step is applied after converting the SIC-processed signal into the post-coded time domain, wherein the SI diminishes separately across the delay and Doppler axes. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection probability, target’s range and velocity root mean square error (RMSE), while maintaining high spectral efficiency and minimal computational complexity."

Second, by applying rudder input and heading observer data, the observer-based MFAC strategy is achieved for the MSV heading control. Meanwhile, to resolve non-self-balancing characteristics existing the heading system, the historical rudder input item is introduced into the control rudder criteria function of MFAC framework. The constructed heading MFAC method only applies the rudder input and heading output data and don’t require any model information of MSVs. Then, the stability of the observer-based heading control strategy is guaranteed by using mathematical analysis. Finally, the simulation results validates that the proposed observer-based MFAC strategy can achieve heading control task."

In this paper, we first conduct a large-scale measurement study with up to 50 million live streams. We find that loss shows <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dynamics</i> and live streaming contains frequent <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">on-off mode switching</i> in the wild. We further find that the recovery latency, enlarged by the ubiquitous retransmission loss, is a critical factor affecting live streaming’s client-side QoE (e.g., video freezing). We then propose an enhanced recovery mechanism called AutoRec, which can transform the disadvantages of on-off mode switching into an advantage for reducing loss recovery latency without any modifications on the client side. AutoRec allows users to customize overhead tolerance and recovery latency tolerance and adaptively adjusts strategies as the network environment changes to ensure that recovery latency meets user demands whenever possible while keeping overhead under control. We implement AutoRec upon QUIC and evaluate it via testbed and real-world commercial services deployments. The experimental results demonstrate the practicability and profitability of AutoRec."

The approach begins with the introduction of a thirdorder source function to enhance the nonlinear wave-current interaction model (NWCIM), enabling a more accurate representation of the modulation effects of deep-sea surface flow fields on short waves. Subsequently, a backscattering model is developed by Bragg backscattering with the Advanced Integral Equation Method (AIEM), offering a refined description of the modulation effects of short waves on radar backscattering. Comparative analyses of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging results for 100 m deep-sea topography and those obtained using a shallowsea imaging model reveal that the proposed method captures more distinct topographic features. This advancement extends the detection range of SAR underwater topography imaging, highlighting its promising potential for deep-sea topography detection and related research applications."

The large-scale outbreak not only affected the marine ecosystem, but also caused serious damage to fisheries, shipping, and coastal economies. How to use satellite remote sensing technology for efficient and accurate monitoring of mucilage has become a hot topic. In this work, an MM identification model, MM-Net, was constructed using the U-Net deep learning framework based on multi-band and multi-type data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). By improving the commonly used Binary Cross Entropy loss function in the basic U-Net and determining the optimal input parameters via comparative experiments, the sensitivity of MM-Net to small-sample mucilage identification was effectively enhanced, and its performance in mucilage detection efficiency boosted. The results show that MM Net significantly outperforms Random Forest, and demonstrates substantial improvements compared with U-Net. The precision (83.0%), recall (77.5%), F1-score (80.2%), and Mean Intersection over Union (66.9%) are 20.1%, 23.6%, 22.1%, and 29.0% higher than that of U-Net, respectively. This indicates that MM-Net has distinct advantages in reducing missed or false classifications while balancing its precision and recall in MM identification. Furthermore, the model performs well in identifying both diffused and aggregated types of marine mucilage. The research findings provide a scientific basis for marine ecological monitoring, environmental governance, and disaster early warning."

    "abstract": "While integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) beamforming has become a research hotspot recently, most proposed approaches remain scenario-specific and suffer from limited generalizability. In this paper, we propose a flexible beamforming design framework for multiple-input multiple-output ISAC (MIMO-ISAC) systems. To characterize the optimal performance tradeoff between the sensing and communication (S&C), the objective is to maximize the weighted sum of S&C mutual information (MI). An integrated fractional programming (IFP) framework is first proposed, from which a semi-closed-form solution for the optimal beamformer is derived. The proposed framework is further extended to several representative ISAC scenarios, including fairness-aware tradeoffs, imperfect channel state information (CSI), dynamic radar cross-section (RCS) variations, and massive MIMO systems. By incorporating advanced optimization techniques, the IFP framework effectively addresses the challenges arising in these scenarios with only minor modifications while still yielding semi-closed-form solutions. Moreover, we show that the IFP framework is closely related to the projected gradient descent (PGD) method, and its computational efficiency can be further enhanced through gradient acceleration techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the IFP framework and its variants consistently outperform benchmark schemes across diverse system settings. The proposed low-complexity and accelerated schemes reduce computation time by approximately 65% and 89%, respectively, with only marginal performance degradation. These results highlight the flexibility and generality of the proposed IFP framework for ISAC beamforming design and are expected to provide valuable insights for the development of future 6G systems."

Although machine learning techniques have been widely used for intrusion detection, most approaches do not support real-time, cost-sensitive response planning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning with quantum optimization to both predict the severity of ransomware infection and recommend optimal recovery strategies. The system employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on structured ransomware incident data to forecast infection rates, followed by a quantum post-processing module using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to minimize operational and financial costs through discrete response decisions. We evaluated the framework on a realistic healthcare ransomware dataset consisting of 5,000 simulated attack scenarios. Our approach achieves a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.073 in the prediction of infection rates and demonstrates up to 25% cost savings over classical heuristics in recovery decisions. Extensive experiments confirm the generalizability of the model to unseen attack types, the scalability across data volumes, and the stability of the decision in risk contexts. The proposed method represents a step toward intelligent real-time ransomware mitigation systems for high-risk environments such as healthcare."

A generalized additive model (GAM) is employed to determine the driven meteorological factors that affected the development of infectious diseases in general. Based on this analysis, we incorporate the identified meteorological variables into a modified susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered (SEIR) model. Then, further integrated this model into a novel two-way ensemble prediction (TEP) framework. This integrated method captures temporal and spatial dynamics of disease transmission. The proposed method demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional epidemiological models.

The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable.

They usually entail a huge amount of continuous and real-time information to be processed from nano-devices, thus paving the way for the spreading of an innovation paradigm, represented by the Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT). The reliability of the envisioned IoNT applications still represents an open issue, due to the complexity of protecting the transmitted data at the nano-scale. In this context, this work proposes to adopt bio-molecular cryptography to secure data exchanges among the nano-devices in a nano-network, which integrates both molecular diffusion and electromagneticbased communication protocols. Bio-molecular cryptography is essentially based on the properties of DNA and proteins. Starting from such premises, a cryptographic algorithm is developed and its performance is evaluated on a reference IoNT scenario in the healthcare domain, along with the study of the behavior of different routing algorithms."

    "abstract": "Networks face growing challenges such as Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks, malware propagation, unauthorized access and irregular traffic patterns. Traditional centralized or static anomaly detection methods often struggle with scalability, latency and privacy concerns, making them less effective in dynamic mobile environments. This research introduces a decentralized federated learning algorithm that integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with treebased classification models, using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) in the experimental setup to enhance anomaly detection while preserving privacy. MARL coordinates agent behavior to adapt to dynamic network conditions, promoting decentralized collaboration and resilience without raw data sharing. Each agent trains a lightweight tree-based model locally for efficient and scalable detection. Feature selection is performed collaboratively using reinforcement signals, while trust-weighted aggregation enables decentralized global learning without a central server. The system is designed to address key constraints such as intermittent communication, which is modeled through agent dropout in the experiments, as well as computational overhead and scalability in edge network environments. Experimental results using real-world intrusion detection datasets show that the proposed method achieves up to 93.5 % accuracy, 86.1 % precision and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$85.7 \\% ~\\mathrm{F} 1$</tex> score, outperforming baseline methods by as much as 23.3 % in F1 score under non-IID scenarios while maintaining low bandwidth and energy usage across dynamic agent participation and varying attacker models."

Later, on March 21, 2011, we observed an ionospheric anomaly associated with the largest radioactive release. This coincides with a reported radioactive gas leak from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP). We explain this phenomenon by stating that radioactive pollution due to its air ionization activity can drastically change the atmospheric boundary layer conductivity and produce anomalous atmospheric variations. Both thermal and ionospheric anomalies can be observed by geospace sensing techniques both from satellites (IR sensors and ionospheric probes) and from the ground (GPS receivers, ground-based ionosondes, VLF propagation sounding). We validate this approach with the two other nuclear power plant emergency events in Three-Mile Island (USA) and Chernobyl (former USSR) and stationary sources such as the Gabon Natural Nuclear Reactor."

To this end, this paper proposes a distributed precoding design based on over-the-air (OTA) signaling to reduce the reliance on backhaul links and lower the communication overhead. Moreover, a deep unfolding network is introduced to accelerate the convergence of the precoding algorithm and enhance the system performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method effectively reduces both backhaul signaling overhead and computational complexity under imperfect CSI conditions while maintaining the high spectral efficiency, offering an efficient solution for collaborative optimization in cell-free massive MIMO systems."

As traditional MI expressions based on Gaussian signalling do not apply to SLP, we firstly derive the expression of the MI for SLP based on finite alphabet inputs, which is shown to be a nonlinear and non-concave function of the precoder. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the MI without investing additional transmit signal power. Due to the original problem being non-convex, we design an iterative gradient-projection (GP)-based algorithm by deriving the gradient of the MI with respect to the SLP signal matrix. To alleviate the heavy reliance on Monte Carlo evaluations, we further propose an effective variant that employs the channel cut-off rate (CR) as a tractable optimizaiton metric within the GP framework. Moreover, we develop a low-complexity algorithm by deriving a closed-form approximation of the MI and addressing the resulting problem through successive convex approximation (SCA), thereby obtaining a near-optimal solution to the original formulation. Numerical results verify that the proposed MI-optimization SLP (MIO-SLP) exhibits a noticeable gain over traditional SLP schemes in terms of MI, and achieves close-to-optimal MI performance, while ensuring satisfactory error rate."

    "abstract": "Sampling design plays a crucial role in managing soil variability at the farm level by ensuring the collection of reliable soil samples. Current methods focus on optimizing sample size and locations within geographic or feature space, taking a global perspective. However, treating geographic and feature space separately diminishes the robustness of the sampling design against deviations from the assumptions of the prediction model. Furthermore, these approaches often overlook local spatial structures of soil, potentially leading to decreased representativeness of the soil samples. In this paper, a novel sampling design method that considers local soil heterogeneity in both geo-graphical and feature spaces was developed. First, the level of local soil heterogeneity was inferred. Second, the study area was divided into spatially continuous subregions, each characterized by similar levels of soil heterogeneity, to facilitate more objective sample assignment. Finally, key sample locations within each subregion were deter-mined by achieving a balance between coverage in both geographical and feature spaces. To validate the proposed method, it was compared to stratified random sampling, k-means sampling and conditional Latin hypercube sampling. The ordinary kriging method was employed to map five soil properties, including soil organic matter, pH, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium. The comparative experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is more effective in generating a sampling plan that accurately represents multiple soil properties by analyzing the local soil spatial structure."

However, prevailing snapshot-based reactive methods are ill-suited for continuously tracking mobile user equipments (UEs) due to their neglect of antenna kinematic constraints and system latency. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a proactive approach by modeling UE tracking as a single, long-term 6DMA trajectory optimization problem to maximize sum spectral efficiency. Leveraging a channel knowledge map (CKM) for predictive data, our model holistically incorporates the system’s complex kinematics and physical constraints, including velocity limits and safety distances, to ensure a physically feasible trajectory. To solve this high-dimensional, non-convex problem, we develop a novel manifold optimization algorithm. This method maps the antenna’s rotational states onto the SO(3) Lie group and employs an adaptive penalty measure with tangent space backpropagation for an efficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate our approach significantly enhances sum spectral efficiency over benchmarks, while ensuring continuous and physically feasible antenna trajectories."

    "abstract": "High-precision orbital products of space-based gravitational wave detectors are essential for gravitational wave data accuracy. The TianQin project is a typical geocentric high-orbit space-based gravitational wave detection mission, characterised by a diverse range of available orbit determination (OD) techniques. GNSS technology is capable of providing continuous observation conditions and serves as the primary space-based OD method for TianQin. However, due to signal attenuation and the performance limitations of onboard equipment, relying solely on GNSS for TianQin OD is unlikely to achieve the precision required for data processing. This paper, focusing on TianQin, innovatively proposes the enhancement of TianQin's GNSS-based OD by leveraging high precision inter-satellite laser links (ISLLs). Building upon GNSS observation data, this study incorporates inter-satellite measurement constraints to establish a network-wide joint parameter estimation model. By forming a unified constraint across multiple satellites and solving for each detector's parameters in an integrated manner, this approach overcomes the limitations of traditional individual detector-by-detector OD, which fails to fully exploit the ultra-high precision constraints of ISLLs to enhance orbital accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of ISLLs significantly enhances both the convergence speed and accuracy. Over a 7-day arc, the proposed ISLL-enhanced method combined with four GNSS signals achieved 3D position and velocity accuracies of 2.05 m and 0.13 mm/s, respectively. These results, corresponding to improvements of 85% and 83% over four GNSS-only solutions, demonstrate the critical role of ISLLs in overcoming sparse-signal limitations at high-Earth orbits."

The liveness, reachability, and reversibility properties ensure that the desired control actions remain perpetually executable, the system states are reachable, and that the system can always return to its initial state, respectively. The sufficient conditions are derived based on the Petri net state equation and the enabling rules of the transitions in SIPNs. Moreover, it is shown how the reachability and reversibility can be computationally verified based on an integer linear programming problem. The computational complexity for verifying the properties is polynomial with respect to the number of markings in the SIPN when the reachable set is already available."

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of noncoherent communication strategies in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We classify noncoherent communication schemes into three main approaches where CSI-free signal recovery is based on subspace detection (i.e., Grassmannian signaling), differential detection, and energy detection. For each approach, we review the theoretical foundation and design methodologies. We also provide comparative insights into their suitability across different channel models and system constraints, highlighting application scenarios where noncoherent methods offer performance and scalability advantages. Furthermore, we discuss practical considerations of noncoherent communication, including compatibility with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), resilience to hardware impairments, and scalability with the number of users. Finally, we provide an outlook on future challenges and research directions in designing robust and efficient noncoherent systems for next-generation wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Series compensation has long been recognized as a viable solution for improving the transient stability of power systems energized by synchronous machines (SMs). However, the generation fleet is increasingly shifting towards inverter-based resources (IBRs). This shift prompts the question as to whether series compensation can also improve the transient stability of systems with IBRs during grid faults. This paper focuses on wind and solar inverters. These inverters predominantly rely on a phase-locked loop (PLL) for synchronization. Therefore, their transient stability is closely linked to the ability of their PLLs to maintain synchronism with the grid voltage during low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) conditions. The available literature on the transient stability of PLL-based IBRs identifies grid weakness as a primary driver of PLL instability. Grid weakness is characterized mainly by the high inductance of long transmission lines. Series compensation is a well-understood solution for reducing the line inductance. Therefore, at the outset, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that series compensation can enhance the transient stability of systems with IBRs as well. This paper puts this hypothesis to analytical and simulation testing, investigating whether the conventional wisdom on series compensation regarding transient stability always holds in systems with IBRs. We identify previously undocumented destabilizing effects caused by the series capacitor and its protective components. A salient feature of this paper is that its findings are independent of PLL design and parameter selection. The theoretical analyses of this study are substantiated by detailed PSCAD/EMTDC simulations of a weak transmission system reinforced through series compensation."

The technique combines numerical squaring with an EDL to improve prediction accuracy in noisy and overlapping spectral conditions. The proposed system uses an FBG interrogator with sensors embedded in transparent liquid containers to detect liquid level changes via Bragg wavelength shifts. However, changes in the liquid level shift the float position, causing overlap or cross-talk between adjacent sensors. To address this, the NSM enhances signal clarity by boosting authentic FBG responses and minimizing noise. Single, double, and triple NSM operations are applied to the experimental data to sharpen the reflection peaks and enhance overall signal quality, ensuring the data are well-prepared for training the EDL model. The EDL model combines CNNs for spectral feature extraction and LSTMs and GRUs for sequential pattern recognition and efficient learning, effectively capturing both spectral and sequential features. The EDL model is trained on the dataset enhanced by the NSM technique and validated using unseen experimental data to evaluate its performance. The results confirm that NSM efficiently sharpens reflection peaks, improves signal clarity, and reduces noise in FBG spectra, while the EDL model effectively demodulates the overlapping spectra. Experimental results demonstrate that the integrated NSM-EDL approach outperforms traditional machine learning and standalone deep learning models in terms of prediction accuracy, minimal errors, and computational time. The proposed method is cost-effective, hardware-efficient, and ideal for real-time multiplexed FBG sensing applications, such as liquid level monitoring."

WFS can theoretically produce realistic wavefronts over an extended area. However, practical implementations suffer from fundamental limitations. These include amplitude errors away from the reference listening region, diffraction artifacts caused by the finite array aperture, loss of low-frequency content due to high-frequency assumptions in the driving signals, and aliasing artifacts from the discretization of the secondary source array. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis on the amplitude errors and diffractional effects by asymptotically evaluating the integral expressions underlying WFS. The resulting expressions reveal how the reproduced sound field can be decomposed into an ideal target component and additional diffraction terms that account for truncation and other boundary effects. We illustrate the impact of these effects on amplitude accuracy for typical secondary source distributions (linear and circular arrays) and extend the analysis to focused sources (virtual sources placed inside the loudspeaker array)."

    "abstract": "Cognitive load (CL) reflects the mental effort required during a task. Traditional CL assessment methods are inter-and intra-subject variability and lack continuous monitoring. Recently, contactless biosignal sensing has emerged as an alternative for unobtrusive CL assessment. In this study, we propose a contactless CL assessment framework using imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG)-gaze signals and cross-modality driven fusion to classify varied CL states. For this, facial videos are acquired from 23 healthy subjects in a semi-controlled environment. iPPG and gaze signals were extracted using the Local Group Invariance method and mediapipe library, respectively. The signals were segmented and applied to parallel 1D CNN, and were fused using cross-modal attention. The proposed approach is able to discriminate between varied CL states. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion model achieved an average classification accuracy (ACC) of 67.96% and F-measure (F-m) of 71.69% outperforming single-modality models. The iPPG signals demonstrated a better mean ACC (55.66%) and F-m (60.71%) among the individual models. While EEG- and multimodal sensors report close to 60–70% accuracy, our contactless method attains comparable performance using solely smartphone video. Thus, the proposed framework could be extended for real-time CL monitoring."

In this paper, we address the question of how to modify, during execution, the desired behavior while maintaining guarantees on the behavior, if possible; we define three types of modification: changing the maximum number of robots in a region of the workspace, changing the connectivity of the workspace, and redistributing robots. During execution, if the specification is modified, we update the controller by creating local patches. Given the starting and ending state of the patch, we jointly use a symbolic synthesis tool and a constraint programming solver to synthesize robot control. We demonstrate our approach in simulation."

    "abstract": "Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is pivotal for smart factories, yet a significant challenge remains in efficiently offloading heterogeneous tasks, which requires balancing deterministic tasks with strict time windows and nondeterministic tasks that demand minimized latency. Traditional optimization methods and standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms often struggle to address the inherent hybrid discrete-continuous action space in joint task offloading and resource allocation. To address this challenge, a Cascaded Dual-Branch Network-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDBN-DRL) method is proposed. First, a dual-branch network that combines convolutional and self-attention mechanisms is constructed for the robust extraction of environmental state features. Then, the extracted feature vector is fed into a cascaded two-layer DRL architecture, where an upper-layer Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) handles discrete offloading decisions, while a lower-layer Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) network manages continuous resource allocation based on the upper-layer decisions. This cascaded structure is designed to effectively manage and co-optimize the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Experimental results indicate that the CDBN-DRL method achieves notable performance, achieving completion rates of 99.4% for deterministic tasks and 98.3% for nondeterministic tasks while outperforming existing state-of-the-art offloading schemes in terms of latency, power consumption, and generalization capability."

    "abstract": "Antarctica, a critical regulator of global climate, faces threats to its permafrost and ecosystems from recent warming. However, a quantitative understanding of subsurface responses remains limited, hindering accurate environmental modeling. This gap hinders accurate modeling of future environmental changes. This study investigates the influence of rising air temperatures on thaw depth and permafrost characteristics by quantifying the links between surface environmental changes and subsurface responses. From 2018–2024, we integrated meteorological observations, drone and satellite remote sensing, and geophysical surveys—electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR)—to assess atmosphere, surface, and subsurface changes. Our results revealed an overall warming trend during the study period, with the average annual air temperature rising by approximately 1 °C and the thaw season extending by up to 50 days. Earlier snowmelt reduced albedo, increasing soil heat absorption and meltwater infiltration. The thaw depth thickened from 1.1 m to 1.5 m (maximum) and from 0.65 m to 0.85 m (dry sites). ERT indicated reduced resistivity at ~1 m depth, reflecting permafrost ice melt, and localized meltwater pooling at ~3 m depth. Normalized difference vegetation index data showed increased vegetation activity. Our study shows that even slight warming can drive linked physical and ecological shifts in Antarctica, with implications for global climate feedbacks. Our quantitative analysis of the increasing late-summer thaw depth provides important data that can contribute to the validation and improvement of regional climate models."

    "abstract": "3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for providing stable and reliable motion states of surrounding obstacles in autonomous driving. Existing methods primarily focus on motion-based and appearance similarity matching approaches. However, the nature of post-process limits the exploitation of multi-modal perception data, hindering the effectiveness of these methods. In this work, we propose E3-MOT, an extended end-to-end multi-modal tracking framework that integrates camera and LiDAR information within a shared BEV representation. A two-stage mechanism is designed, where the first stage performs end-to-end joint detection and tracking. The track query is then introduced to represent the tracked instances, which is transferred and updated across consecutive frames, enabling iterative prediction throughout the tracking process. In the second stage, we design a motion-based tracking filter, which enhances the robustness through the stage-2 association between unmatched detections and trajectories on image plane to address the long-tail distribution challenge. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. E3-MOT achieves 67.4% AMOTA, and under sensor-failure conditions it still maintains 62.5% AMOTA, outperforming multiple representative baselines. Real-world tests on a UGV platform further validate the practicality and robustness of the framework. The source code is available at https://github.com/HITXCI/w-trk."

    "abstract": "Controlling complex, nonlinear systems, such as the brain, presents a fundamental challenge that requires simplified models for practical controller design. Traditional approaches often fail when these systems operate far from steady states under noise and changing inputs. Different control strategies drive systems into distinct behavioral regimes, each requiring a specific approximation. Rather than imposing a single approximation, this work introduces ergodic quasilinearization (EQL), which automatically identifies the appropriate linear model for each operating scenario. EQL generates adaptive linear models whose parameters adjust based on the system’s long-term statistical behavior under varying inputs and noise levels. These statistics are derived analytically from the steady-state equalities, eliminating the need for repeated computation of the full nonlinear dynamics. The effectiveness of EQL is demonstrated on large-scale brain network models, where traditional methods encounter difficulties due to complex nonlinearities and high dimensionality. Conventional linearization methods perform well under fixed conditions but lose accuracy when control strategies change the operating regime. In contrast, EQL maintains accuracy across diverse operating scenarios, supporting robust controller design for systems that rarely reach simple steady states. We demonstrate the power of EQL in predicting brain-model responses to complex stimulation protocols and in identifying an optimal open-loop control for reproducing target brain-activity patterns."

Joint control, communication, and computing technologies must be considered for the mission performance of these reusable rockets. This paper introduces a quantum reinforcement learning for the joint control, communication, and computing (QRL-C3) algorithm designed for quantum reusable rockets. The QRL-C3 aims to solve the issue of diminished training performance in high-dimensional states and action spaces prevalent in conventional reinforcement learning (RL). Leveraging quantum neural networks (QNN) with superposition and entanglement, QRL-C3 enhances information representation and processing. The framework integrates a (i) robust quantum control system for precise re-entry and landing, a (ii) quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL)-based scheduler for seamless communication with multiple ground stations (GSs) for enabling Internet-of-Things (IoT) services, and (iii) energy-efficient computing algorithms considering queue backlog for optimal image processing and transmission power management. These components synergistically improve mission performance and rocket re-usability. Experimental validation using SpaceX's Falcon 9 model demonstrates that QRL-C3 outperforms conventional RL approaches, achieving higher training efficiency. This study is the first to integrate control, communication, and computing systems in reusable rockets through quantum artificial intelligence (QAI), paving the way for future advancements in QAI-based space technologies."

The proposed topology operates in two distinct modes, controlled by two switches with the same duty cycle, achieving high voltage conversion without employing a transformer, voltage multiplier, coupled inductor, or complex voltage-lifting techniques. A comprehensive analysis of the converter's operation, voltage gain, and efficiency is provided, along with a comparative assessment against state-of-the-art high-gain converters. The proposed design exhibits a lower component count, reduced voltage stress on power devices, and minimized power losses, making it highly suitable for fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) applications. Experimental validation is conducted using a 180 W laboratory prototype, demonstrating the converter's superior dynamic performance and high efficiency. The results confirm that the proposed topology offers an optimal balance of simplicity, efficiency, and reliability, making it a strong candidate for next-generation FCEV powertrains."

Owing to its limited computational capacity, the cloud may need to be considered with the edge for offloading. Task offloading is challenging, because of the availability of limited resources, dynamically changing network conditions, and concurrent user access. Mathematical task offloading approaches may be incapable of capturing dynamic network situations in large end-to-end network models. We propose D2-TONE (Data-driven Deep Neural Network Task Offloading on the Network Edge), an approach that employs Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to accurately estimate offloading costs, such as computation and transmission costs. D2-TONE adapts holistically to dynamic network situations, and provides optimal/near-optimal offloading solutions in real-time. In addition, D2-TONE employs the distributed execution of Deep Neural Network (DNN) training tasks on the edge-cloud continuum. Experiments revealed that D2-TONE reduces the training time by 1.55 to 2.77 times, compared to baseline approaches. In addition, the edge based D2-TONE offers an improvement of 55-76% in the data processing ratio, compared to other offloading approaches."

Crucially, SRSDNet pioneers the use of 500-m resolution Sentinel-1 SD products as area-constrained labels, eliminating point-to-pixel mismatches. Its architecture incorporates three novel modules, the bidirectional feature extract block (BFEB) extracts anisotropic features via bidirectional convolutions to resolve mountain snow textures; the optimized coordination attention (OCA) dynamically weighted multi-source channels, especially low-frequency microwaves in deep snow; and the reconstructive output block (ROB) reconstructs 6.25-km outputs with local detail and global consistency. The results of this study were systematically validated at 95 meteorological stations in QTP during the 2017-2018 snow season, SRSDNet achieves best-in-class accuracy (RMSE = 12.075 cm, MAE = 7.724 cm, R2 = 0.781).

    "abstract": "Clock synchronization and localization are two fundamental problems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Joint synchronization and ranging have been shown to significantly improve their accuracy. However, most existing work assumes that the recorded timestamps at all network nodes have the same error statistics, regardless of their received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). This model is less realistic because the timestamp recorded from a low-quality signal, such as a low SNR, could suffer higher errors than those with higher SNRs. This paper proposes a Weighted Least Square (WLS) solution for joint synchronization and ranging in WSNs. A more practical timestamp model is introduced that considers the impact of received signal quality on timestamp measurement errors. Based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), a weighting coefficient matrix is constructed for the WLS algorithm. Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is derived to provide a baseline for different algorithms. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is considerably improved, compared to the conventional Least Square (LS) solution, and in many cases approaches the CRLB. For example, the proposed WLS solution is over 10% more accurate than the LS counterpart in estimating the clock skew and clock offset of the nodes in the WSN comprising four anchor nodes and one sensor node. In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed WLS algorithm is shown to be only slightly increased compared to that of the conventional LS algorithm. For example, the computation of the former is approximately 6.4% more complex than that of the latter for a WSN of 10 anchors and one sensor. This makes the proposed WLS solution especially suitable for the joint synchronization and ranging problem in a dense WSN where the number of anchors and the number of timestamp transmissions between nodes are large."

    "abstract": "5G mobile network defines a set of use cases with very distinct requirements with regard to throughput, low latency, and high reliability. Network slicing is essential for addressing these end-to-end needs, breaking away from the monolithic architectures characteristic of previous mobile network generations. The Open RAN movement promotes the disaggregation of infrastructure components, allowing for contributions from various vendors and enhancing flexibility and openness within the ecosystem. On the other hand, this paradigm shift introduces potential security threats and vulnerabilities that challenges Slice reliability in Open RAN domains. This work presents a comprehensive investigation through a systematic literature review, examining the current research landscape regarding the security aspects of Open RAN slicing based on O-RAN standards, including studies focused on security metrics and indicators. Additionally, it evaluates the effectiveness of proposed solutions and identifies critical gaps that require further research. By providing a detailed overview of existing research and potential security strategies, this work aims to contribute to the development of secure and robust 5 G networks."

    "abstract": "The number of users using mobile services grows year by year. Consequently, the edge of mobile networks brings storage and processing capabilities closer to the users to reduce latency and provide better quality of experience. In this sense, the objective of this paper is to evaluate cache server selection policies at the edge of mobile networks. We simulate different cache server selection policies, storage capacity, and how storage is distributed between the cache server instances. Simulation results show that cache server selection policies have a reduced impact on cache efficiency at the edge of mobile networks. On the other hand, larger storage capacity can reduce the average delay by 36 %. The results also show that concentrating the cache storage capacity on a single server instead of distributing it can reduce the maintenance cost by impacting the average delay by less than 3%."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework, ICEEMDAN-PatchTST+FDPO, which integrates advanced signal decomposition, Transformer-based time series forecasting, and forecast-driven portfolio optimization (FDPO). Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) enhances signal stationarity by decomposing noisy financial series into intrinsic mode functions, while PatchTST employs patch-wise self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies. These components enable precise multi-step return forecasting, which is subsequently operationalized through FDPO to generate dynamically optimized allocations aligned with predicted market movements. Extensive out-of-sample evaluations from January 2022 to December 2024 on a rule-based selection of ten representative NIFTY 50 constituents demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers substantial gains over conventional baselines (EqualWeight, Mean–Variance Optimization, Risk Parity) and alternative deep learning models (LSTM, TimesNet, NBEATSx, Informer) in both forecasting accuracy and portfolio performance. The model achieves the lowest MAE (38.25), RMSE (55.92), and MAPE (2.06%), with an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.9776.

Alignment metrics such as Cosine Similarity and Jensen–Shannon Divergence further indicate that its weight vectors closely approximate ideal allocations based on actual future returns. A supplementary validation on a rule-based S&P 500 subset corroborates these trends, suggesting that the framework maintains its performance advantages across distinct market environments.

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) presents significant challenges due to the limited onboard computational resources, which often restrict deployed deep neural networks to shallow architectures incapable of handling complex environments. Additionally, offloading tasks to remote edge servers introduces high latency, creating an inherent trade-off in system design. To address these limitations, we propose CoDrone—the first cloud-edge-end collaborative computing framework that integrates foundation models into autonomous UAV cruising scenarios—effectively leveraging foundation models to enhance the performance of resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle platforms. To reduce both onboard computation and data transmission overhead, CoDrone employs grayscale imagery for the navigation model. When enhanced environmental perception is required, CoDrone leverages the edge-assisted foundation model Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and introduces a novel, one-dimensional occupancy grid–based navigation method—enabling fine-grained scene understanding while significantly advancing the efficiency and representational simplicity of autonomous navigation. A key component of CoDrone is a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based neural scheduler that seamlessly integrates depth estimation with autonomous navigation decisions, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments. Furthermore, the framework introduces a UAV-specific vision language interaction module, which incorporates domain-tailored low-level flight primitives to enable effective interaction between the cloud foundation model, the Vision Language model, and the UAV. The introduction of VLM enhances open-set reasoning capabilities in complex and previously unseen scenarios. We implement a prototype of CoDrone and conduct extensive evaluations in the AirSim simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDrone significantly outperforms baseline methods under varying flight speeds and network conditions, achieving a 40% increase in average flight distance and a 5% improvement in average Quality of Navigation."

    "abstract": "To enhance intelligent identification of image authenticity and tampering in electronic data forensics, this paper proposes a self-supervised CLIP-based image recognition and analysis framework. Addressing current forensic limitations such as reliance on manual expertise and insufficient multimodal semantic understanding, the framework adopts the CLIP model as the foundation for image–text semantic alignment. By integrating a cross-attention mechanism, it strengthens fine-grained semantic association modeling between images and text. In addition, multiple self-supervised learning tasks, including image contrastive learning and pseudo-label prediction, are designed to guide the model in learning potential tampering features and semantic deviations under unsupervised conditions. Experiments conducted on datasets containing both authentic and manipulated images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in both authenticity assessment and suspicious region localization. Compared with traditional supervised approaches and mainstream deep learning methods, the framework shows notable advantages. This work not only presents broad application potential in electronic data forensics but also provides a practical foundation for advancing multimodal learning within judicial technology."

    "abstract": "High performance brain PET scanners suitable for accurate and precise measurement of uptake in small regions of the brain require high spatial resolution (1.5–2 mm) together with high system sensitivity. While small cross section crystals are needed to achieve high spatial resolution with pixelated detectors, effective system sensitivity requires long crystals and good time-of-flight (TOF) resolution. In addition, depending on crystal thickness, some level of depth-of-interaction (DOI) capability may also be needed to reduce parallax error. While various methods for DOI measurement can be utilized within the detector, the impact on reconstructed spatial resolution as a function of crystal thickness needs to be carefully evaluated. The focus of this work is to use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the impact of crystal size, thickness, and DOI resolution on the reconstructed spatial resolution in a high-resolution brain scanner design. Two crystal cross sections were chosen, 1.6 mm 1.6 mm and 2 mm 2 mm, and three different LSO crystal thickness (10 mm, 15 mm, and 20 mm) were evaluated. We evaluated these system designs without DOI capability and with DOI resolution (4–12 mm) for varying crystal thickness. In addition, we evaluated the use of image-space resolution modeling (IRM) techniques, which can mitigate losses in spatial resolution and positioning accuracy due to parallax error and Compton scatter, and to complement the advantages of DOI capability. A brain size elliptical phantom with small spheres was simulated to study the overall benefit in uptake measurements for small objects using the contrast recovery coefficient (CRC) metric. Our results show that a system with 2 mm 2 mm crystals can provide comparable image quality in terms of CRC measurement than one with 1.6 mm 1.6 mm crystals. However, crystal thickness has a bigger impact on spatial resolution and CRC with performance degrading with best performance achieved with 10 mm thick crystals. DOI measurement is necessary with longer crystals in order to maintain good imaging performance with high sensitivity. For the 15 mm thick crystals 9 mm DOI resolution is needed to compensate for the loss in spatial resolution compared to 10 mm thick crystals without DOI, but still with lower CRC. A similar conclusion is reached for 20 mm crystals with 4 mm DOI resolution. Alternatively, IRM methods can provide improved and similar performance for all crystal thicknesses studied here, indicating a pathway for achieving our brain scanner design goals without additional cost, complexity, and performance tradeoffs. This work provides a systematic investigation for designing future brain PET systems."

    "abstract": "The stochastic resource allocation (SRA) problem, commonly seen in the decision-making of complex systems, is a typical combinatorial optimization challenge that seeks optimality, quickness, as well as generality. Among various SRA algorithms, constructive heuristics (CH) such as greedy algorithms construct feasible solutions by prioritizing optional resource-task allocation pairs based on a predefined evaluation criterion. They are very suitable for real-time decision-making due to their simplicity and low computational complexity. However, relying on a single fixed criterion can impair optimality and generality. To achieve a generalized expression for the criterion, this paper establishes a fuzzy evaluation system that determines the component priorities by leveraging SRA problem features, enabling diversified and flexible solution construction. Furthermore, for the sake of generality, this paper proposes a fuzzy-evaluation-based constructive heuristics generation framework (FCHG), which generates an ensemble of complementary CHs through automatic training. FCHG adopts an adversarial coevolution mechanism, using the SRA instance generator and evolutionary algorithms to realize competition-based coevolution between the SRA instances and CHs. For SRA problem-solving, the CH ensemble obtained by FCHG can construct multiple SRA solutions efficiently, and the best one will serve as the final solution. Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art algorithms, covering instances with varying scales and structural characteristics, demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of the CH ensemble in solving the SRA problem in terms of optimality, quickness, generality, and numerical stability."

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of graph data in scale, noise, and structural complexity, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are reaching a performance bottleneck when simultaneously modelling uncertainty and long-range dependencies. To overcome this limitation, we introduce FGMMa, a two-stage framework composed of node-level Fuzzy Graph Message Passing (FGMP) and subgraph-level Fuzzy NeuralSort Graph Mamba. FGMP assigns a learnable fuzzy membership degree to each edge and employs a fuzzy-max aggregator to suppress noise at its source, thereby enhancing the robustness and interpretability of node representations. The Fuzzy NeuralSort Graph Mamba subsequently applies NeuralSort to order fuzzy subgraph features and utilises the linear-time Graph Mamba to dynamically regulate inter-subgraph information flow, generating high-quality sequential embeddings that capture long-range dependencies. Consequently, FGMMa offers a principled integration of fuzzy theory and graph representation learning. The node, fuzzy, and sequential subgraph embeddings are then fused to perform node classification and other downstream tasks. Across seven public benchmark datasets, FGMMa attains state-of-the-art node-classification accuracies of 93.42% on Amazon-Photo and 96.83% on Reddit, surpasses strong baselines on the remaining datasets, and yields lower average running time together with higher <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F_{1}$</tex-math></inline-formula> scores.

    "abstract": "Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely computing the sum of the inputs from multiple users by an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where numerous clients, each holding a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server. The server then generates an aggregate model, typically through averaging, which is shared back with clients as the starting point for a new round of local training. To protect data security, secure aggregation protocols leverage cryptographic techniques to ensure the server gains no additional information beyond the input sum, even if it colludes with a subset of users. While the simple star client-server architecture provides insights into the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, it falls short of capturing the impact of network topology in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a three-layer hierarchical network, where clustered users communicate with an aggregation server via an intermediate layer of relays. In addition to conventional server security which ensures the server learns only the input sum, we also impose relay security, requiring that the relays remain oblivious to users’ inputs. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication efficiency (measured by user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and key generation efficiency (including individual and source key rates). A core contribution of this work is the derivation of the optimal source key rate as a function of the number of relays, cluster size, and collusion level. We propose an optimal communication scheme alongside a key generation scheme utilizing a novel matrix structure called extended Vandermonde matrix that guarantees both input sum recovery and security. Moreover, we derive a tight information-theoretic converse proof to establish the optimal rate region for the HSA problem."

    "abstract": "Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are crucial in modeling complex high-order correlations in diverse domains, utilizing hyperedges that connect multiple vertices. However, their susceptibility to structural attacks and irrational connections can disrupt message propagation and degrade performance. To address these issues, we introduce the HGNN Shield, a defense framework incorporating two key modules: Hyperedge-Dependent Estimation (HDE) and High-Order Shield (HOS). The HDE module prioritizes vertex dependencies within hyperedges and adapts traditional connectivity measures to hypergraphs, facilitating precise structural modifications. This adaptation allows for a nuanced assessment of vertex relationships within hyperedges, contributing theoretically by extending classical graph-based connection dependency measures to hypergraphs. Following HDE, the HOS module, positioned before convolutional layers, consists of three submodules: Hyperpath Cut, Hyperpath Link, and Hyperpath Refine. These components collectively detect, disconnect, and refine adversarial connections, ensuring robust message propagation. The theoretical contribution of the HOS module lies in maintaining hyperpath integrity and learning trajectory under adversarial conditions, providing a certifiable defense mechanism against high-order structural attacks. Experiments on six hypergraph datasets indicate that HGNN Shield significantly enhances robustness and maintains data integrity against targeted attacks, outperforming existing methods (an average performance improvement of 9.33% over other methods). Our framework not only improves HGNN reliability but also advances security in hypergraph-based applications."

One of the candidate data delivery architectures that can meet the stringent requirements is restricting the data delivery path within the network edge by letting an edge server relay data between sources and destinations in its coverage. To that end, edge servers need to equip two important functionalities: 1) a reliable and lightweight data transport protocol to collect data from numerous data sources, and 2) an efficient data streaming platform that delivers collected data to consumers with high throughput and low latency. In this work, we design and implement Kafka- Thor, a Kafka-based high-performance data streaming platform, specifically designed for edge servers to collect and deliver timecritical data for enhanced V2X services. The platform reduces E2E data delivery latency by optimizing the data delivery architecture in Kafka using two novel technologies, the singlepoller, multi-worker (SPMW) architecture and service-specific dynamic batching (SS-batching). Experimental results show that Kafka-Thor significantly improves latency and reliability in E2E data delivery, making enhanced V2X services feasible."

The structure operates in the industrial, scientific and medical frequency bands (ISM) of 433 MHz and 915 MHz. Both single and dual layer configurations are optimized through simulations, with the dual-layer implementation further validated via fabricated prototypes on printed circuit board (PCB) and e-textile substrates. The experimental and simulation results confirm the reduction of transmission losses and compliance with the safe specific absorption rate (SAR) limits. These findings demonstrate the potential of MIW for efficient and reliable integration into wireless body area network (WBAN) systems."

    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of decentralized wireless networks, their vulnerability to cyber attacks has become a pressing concern. The availability of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) is critical for applications like disaster recovery and emergency response, making them especially vulnerable to physical-layer threats such as jamming, where adversaries transmit high-power noise to disrupt communication. We consider critical scenarios in which MANET nodes serve as a backbone for mobile users. Existing jamming defenses often rely on non-adaptive optimization, assume simplified environments, target secondary metrics, or ignore mobility. We propose Proactive Data-driven Relocation (PADRE), a proactive decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based node relocation scheme aimed at maximizing throughput during jamming. Simulations show that PADRE outperforms our proposed heuristic baseline by up to 278 % in static and 585 % in dynamic scenarios with realistic mobility, varying node/jammer counts and strengths. It also shows quick recovery and maintains high performance under severe signaling disruption, with nearly unimpaired results even beyond 75 % signaling packet loss."

Motivated by this potential, this paper proposes a wireless sensing model called MDA-CSI for recognizing human activities in indoor environments.

    "abstract": "The Landsat program has enabled the acquisition of global observation data since 1972. The combination of multiple Landsat sensors enables long-term monitoring of terrestrial vegetation. However, differences in sensor specifications (e.g., spectral responses) cause biases between reflectances of sensors as well as between spectral vegetation indices used for vegetation monitoring. These biases depend on the biophysical/biochemical characteristics of the vegetation and the components of nonvegetation surfaces. In addition, acquiring simultaneous observation data from two sensors can sometimes be impossible because of differences in satellite orbits. These limitations complicate regression/training of empirical models and can degrade their accuracy. To overcome these issues, in the present study, we developed an algorithm for harmonizing time-series reflectances and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from multiple Landsat sensors (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) using a recently proposed algorithm based on a spectral mixture model (i.e., an unmixing-based algorithm). The algorithm does not require regression/training of models using simultaneous observation data from two sensors. The algorithm was evaluated using actual data with a test site that included mangrove forests. The results of pixel-by-pixel comparisons showed that the consistency of the NDVI across three satellites improved after the algorithm-based transformations. The NDVI time series of a sample pixel also showed improved consistency after the transformations. Further investigations should be conducted to harmonize reflectances with other types of land cover, as well as with the reflectances detected by other sensors."

    "abstract": "Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) code biases are a significant source of error in ionospheric Total electron content (TEC) modeling and inversion, and they need to be accurately determined. Since the code bias parameters and ionospheric TEC parameters are coupled together in the observation equations, they cannot be directly separated. Therefore, the estimation of code biases must take into account the processing strategy for the TEC parameters. The conventional methods mainly involve function fitting or using existing information for elimination, relying on function models and Global ionosphere maps (GIM), and cannot achieve direct estimation. Based on existing research, this paper attempts to directly estimate the combined code bias values for satellites and receivers at individual stations by simplifying the processing of TEC using single-station observation data. Then, by combining regional or global stations, the code bias values for satellites and receivers can be further obtained, achieving a new method for code bias estimation. Two datasets from the first month of 2014 (a high solar activity years) and 2020 (a low solar activity years) were selected for experimental analysis. The RMS of the estimated TEC for all stations relative to CODE’s GIM was mostly within 3 TECu, with mean values of approximately 4 TECu and 2 TECu, respectively. Using the Differential code bias (DCB) products provided by CODE as a reference, the RMS of the estimated DCBs for GPS and GLONASS satellites in 2014 were 0.14 and 0.42ns, and that in 2020 were 0.07 and 0.18 ns, showing good consistency and validating the effectiveness of the method."

    "abstract": "Expensive multi-objective binary optimization problems frequently emerge in real-world applications, where evaluating a single solution incurs significant computational or physical costs. The combinatorial nature of the binary search space further exacerbates the difficulty, often resulting in poor scalability and slow convergence for traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Although surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms provide a promising alternative by leveraging models to predict the utility of candidate solutions or provide search guidance, most existing approaches model each objective independently and struggle to maintain a proper balance between convergence and diversity under strict evaluation budgets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method within the decomposition-based framework: Multi-objective Kernel Ridge Regression-Assisted Subproblem Co-optimization (MOKRR-SCo). The algorithm integrates three key components: 1) Multi-objective Kernel Ridge Regression (MOKRR), which constructs a unified surrogate model using a shared weighted Hamming kernel to jointly approximate multiple objectives; 2) MOKRR-driven Subproblem Co-optimization (MSCO), which leverages historical data and MOKRR model predictions to collaboratively guide search across subproblems; and 3) Diversity-Driven Infill Sampling Criterion (DDISC), which selects sparse solutions from the MSCO-evolved population for expensive evaluations for each subproblem, enhancing diversity and mitigating the adverse effects of surrogate errors. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world expensive multi-objective binary optimization problems demonstrate that MOKRR-SCo consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both convergence and diversity under tight evaluation budgets. The source codes of the proposed MOKRR-SCo algorithm are available from."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models enable high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, fine-tuning these pre-trained models for personalization raises concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To address this issue, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has recently been proposed, which embeds watermarks into fine-tuning datasets via backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain dormant on benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite its promise, the robustness of DOV against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how adversaries can circumvent these mechanisms, enabling models trained on watermarked datasets to bypass ownership verification. We begin by analyzing the limitations of potential attacks achieved by backdoor removal, including TPD and T2IShield. In practice, TPD suffers from inconsistent effectiveness due to randomness, while T2IShield fails when watermarks are embedded as local image patches. To this end, we introduce CEAT2I, the first CEA specifically targeting DOV in T2I diffusion models. CEAT2I consists of three stages: (1) motivated by the observation that T2I models converge faster on watermarked samples with respect to intermediate features rather than training loss, we reliably detect watermarked samples; (2) we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected samples and monitor feature shifts to identify trigger tokens; and (3) we apply a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEAT2I effectively evades state-of-the-art DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/csyufei/CEAT2I."

Anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have become essential for safeguarding corporate networks, but existing technologies have some limitations in practice. (i) The interweaving of traffic from different service types increases the difficulty of identification. (ii) The scarcity of labeled malicious samples hinders the detection of both known and emerging threats. To tackle these issues, we propose a service-oriented approach to model benign traffic and leverage meta-learning to construct a robust metric space for precise sample comparison. Based on this, we develop SOFA, a two-stage traffic detection framework. In the first stage, SOFA identifies distinct service types within the network and trains independent one-class models for each, ensuring service-specific attack traffic is detected with high precision. The second stage employs a ResNet-based Siamese network to overcome the limitations posed by scarce malicious samples, enhancing detection of both known and emerging attacks. We evaluate SOFA on four widely used network tracing datasets, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms a diverse set of existing methods in fine-grained attack detection. These results highlight the potential of SOFA for improving network security in a highly dynamic and unbalanced threat environment."

This study evaluates a wearable vibrotactile stimulation system that conveys object stiffness information through two encoding strategies: Proposed Spatiotemporal Encoding and Circular Encoding, applied to two anatomical locations: upper-arm and forearm. Ten healthy participants completed structured trials of stiffness-discrimination involving vibrotactile cues corresponding to four stiffness categories. The results showed significantly higher classification accuracy (CA) and information transfer (IT) with the Proposed encoding strategy at both sites. The upper-arm-proposed configuration achieved peak performance (CA: 97.75%, IT: 1.84 bit/s), whereas the forearm-circular strategy yielded the lowest (CA: 73.62%, IT: 0.86 bit/s). NASA-TLX scores indicated a significantly lower mental workload for the proposed strategy, with the upper-arm feedback location providing superior perceptual clarity. A supplementary evaluation with a transradial amputee further demonstrated that the proposed encoding strategy remained interpretable, achieving classification accuracies above 85%. The classification accuracies over different conditions followed the same pattern as observed in healthy participants. These findings validate the importance of encoding geometry and stimulation site in designing effective haptic interfaces and support the feasibility of spatially distributed, non-invasive vibrotactile feedback for enhancing tactile perception in prosthetic applications."

Firstly, GIRESO-AB is proposed to estimate the fundamental frequency back electromotive force (BEMF) and high-frequency (HF) BEMF. GIRESO-AB has two estimation loops, one is a fast interference estimation loop based on generalized integration, and the other is a low-frequency interference estimation loop. The fast interference estimation loop has the characteristics of a bandpass filter, which can accurately estimate HF BEMF. GIRESO-AB adapts bandwidth through current error, and the low-frequency interference estimation loop has notch characteristics at the injection frequency. Therefore, the low-frequency estimation loop can accurately estimate the fundamental frequency BEMF. Then, the unified model in the full-speed domain is established. The rotor position and speed are estimated through the unified model, which does not require switching between the two estimation methods. The unified model does not jump in phase with or without HF voltage injection. Compared with the traditional full-speed domain estimation method, it simplifies the control algorithm, eliminates the phase jump of the unified model when HF voltage is injected or not, and can improve the position observation accuracy."

The antenna design achieves a low-profile structure without any dielectric. By eliminating the dielectric substrate, the antenna is entirely metallic, which enhances its power-handling capability. The proposed antenna consists of two shorted patches that serve as radiators, and a box reflector that adjusts the gain and improves its front-to-back ratio (FBR). Two shorting walls of the antenna significantly reduce the thermal resistance to the ground and make the antenna work in anti-symmetric TM10 mode. Operating at 2.4 GHz, the antenna features a compact size of 0.74 λ × 0.56 λ × 0.15 λ and a solder-free design. The |S11| < −10 dB bandwidth spans from 2.30 GHz to 2.56 GHz. The antenna exhibits excellent radiation performance with a measured gain of 6.8 dBi, and wide 3 dB beamwidths of 100.8° and 66.8° in the E-plane and H-plane, respectively. Unmanned indoor high power WPT experiments were carried out. The proposed antenna exhibits good heat dissipation performance and stable radiation. The characteristics of low-profile, high-power capacity, and wide beamwidth make the proposed antenna well-suited for unmanned indoor wireless power transmission applications."

The feasible decision sets of all players in the game are coupled together by shared coupling constraints, and each player does not have full access to their opponent's decisions. In these games, each player aims to minimize its own cost function, which depends on its own decisions and those of other players. Using variational equilibrium as an improved solution and leveraging operator splitting technique, the problem is restated as seeking the zero of the sum of monotone operators. Then, we propose a fully distributed algorithm based on a new modification of the forward–backward operator splitting methods. It is proved that the designed algorithm generates a sequence that is shown to be convergent to the variational GNE (v-GNE) with constant step sizes, without relying on restricted cocoercivity of the forward operator. Moreover, based on the designed operators and supported by theoretical analysis, the designed algorithm can achieve linear convergence under standard assumptions on the game mapping. Finally, the proposed algorithm is also verified via numerical experiments."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained IP geolocation plays a critical role in applications such as location-based services and cybersecurity. Most existing fine-grained IP geolocation methods treat the task as a coordinate regression problem. However, due to inherent noise in the IP features, they frequently produce kilometer-scale coordinate errors, which in turn lead to inaccuracies when the predicted coordinates are mapped to geographic regions. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a novel IP region prediction framework HMCGeo, framing IP region prediction as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem. City administrators divide urban areas into regions at multiple granularities. The proposed framework employs residual connection-based feature extraction units to obtain IP representations at each granularity and introduces class prototype attention to predict the IP’s belonging region at the current granularity. Additionally, it adopts an output fusion strategy combined with hierarchical focal loss to further enhance region prediction performance. We evaluate HMCGeo on real-world datasets from New York, Los Angeles, and Shanghai. It significantly outperforms existing methods in region prediction across all granularities and achieves lower coordinate errors on most samples by similarity-weighted averaging of candidate region centers."

Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) offer a solution, but traditional DLT architectures, such as blockchain, are often incompatible with low-power wireless IoT networks (LPWAN) due to their latency and operational cost. This paper presents a comparative and empirical performance analysis of two end-to-end data oracle systems designed to record data from a LoRaWAN sensor network. The first implementation uses IOTA Tangle, while the second is based on a blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By evaluating key indicators such as latency and transaction costs, our results demonstrate that the IOTA system offers significant superiority, with a predictable median latency of 4.47 seconds and transaction costs that are economically negligible. In contrast, the blockchain implementation incurred measurable gas costs and demonstrated an architecture with inherently higher and extremely unpredictable latency, with a median of 11.52 seconds and outliers exceeding 200 seconds. We conclude that the IOTA Tangle architecture is technologically and economically better prepared to support scalable and sustainable IoT applications over wireless infrastructures."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the high-performance control problem of three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converters, focusing on prescribed-performance voltage regulation, enhanced disturbance rejection, and current harmonic suppression. In the voltage regulation loop, a prescribed-performance generalized super-twisting control (GSTC) algorithm is proposed based on error transformation functions. This method features a simple structure, guarantees that the dc-link voltage strictly satisfies the predefined performance constraints, and enables accurate tracking of both continuous and discontinuous voltage reference signals. In addition, a filtered generalized proportional-integral (PI) observer with improved noise tolerance capability is developed to enhance the robustness of voltage regulation. In the current tracking loop, a periodic iterative learning GSTC method is presented to achieve fast and precise current control with low harmonic distortion. The convergence of both the proposed generalized super-twisting controllers and the observer is rigorously analyzed. Finally, experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed control scheme."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an additively manufactured, low-cost, light weight, wideband, high-gain, multifunctional metalens antenna capable of wide band polarization conversion with broadside gain and aperture efficiency enhancement. The design incorporates a phase-graded multifunctional metalens polarizer (PGMP) made-up of cross-shaped air cavity embedded asymmetric polylactic acid (PLA) material structure as unit cell. This novel unit cell is optimized and designed in a way to achieve full 360° transmission phase compensation with collimation by varying the air cavity height. The PGMP integrated in near-field with the feed antenna performs near-field phase transformation to correct quadratic phase errors at the feed aperture. When integrated with the feed, the PGMP enables polarization control and enhances radiation performance through axial rotation (φ), providing LP to RHCP at φ = +45 rotation, LP to LHCP at φ = -45° rotation, and retains LP at φ = 0° or 90° rotation with wide band gain enhancement of 12 to 15 dB. For circular polarization configurations, the antenna achieves the measured below 3-dB axial ratio and 3 dB gain bandwidth of 10 GHz (24.9-34.9 GHz) with broad side peak gain of 24.8 dBi, and 36.6% aperture efficiency at 30 GHz. For linear polarization configuration, the 3-dB gain bandwidth of 10.6 GHz (25.6-36.2 GHz) with broadside peak gain of 24.9-dBi and 37.5% aperture efficiency. The antenna demonstrates stable and wide band multifunctional performance, making it suitable for millimeter-wave imaging and security applications."

    "abstract": "Impedance measurement systems for sensor arrays exhibit large seemingly high random deviations in amplitude and in phase compromising measurement accuracy and repeatability. Although frequently reported, their causes have not been systematically investigated. In this paper we address the spectral leakage due to non-integer number of measured signal periods and the lack of synchronization between excitation and response signals. We investigate both aspects with the aim to understand, characterize and compensate them. We present a novel methodology, realizing a coherent synchronized sampling of the excitation signal and the response signal and eliminating spectral leakage. Based on analytical investigation, we establish precise mathematical relationships between excitation frequency, sampling rate, and acquisition window length, guaranteeing the capture of exact integer signal periods. The novel method has been validated on an STM32H7 microcontroller-based platform with a 1:10 multiplexer configuration, testing resistances from 43 kΩ to 2 MΩ and complex impedances at frequencies ranging from 997 Hz to 15.625 kHz. Experimental validation shows standard deviations below 0.11 % for resistances up to 910 kΩ and below 0.04 % and 0.07 ° for magnitude and phase of complex impedance respectively, confirming the method’s high precision. The proposed synchronization methodology provides a practical solution for enhancing measurement accuracy and reliability in impedimetric sensor arrays and is also particularly relevant for multifrequency measurements."

    "abstract": "Aviation electric propulsion has been increasingly used both in terms of its application scale and the weight of aircraft it drives. For the electric propulsion system composed of electrically driven rotary aerodynamic load, revealing the steady-state operating status subject to external flight conditions and internal matching constraints among components is beneficial to design and operating of electric aircraft. This paper proposes a candidate operating line theory for aviation electric propulsion. By transforming aircraft and propulsive dynamics into algebraic equality constraints, the operating status of propulsion components are located on constraint hyperplanes of voltage and torque conservation with external flight conditions. The operating line is defined as the intersection of the two hyperplanes. The governing variables comprise battery current, shaft rotation speed, and motor duty cycle, which are solved sequentially using the trim equations between connecting components. The proposed method is applied to an electric aircraft with verified propulsive performance. The influence of external conditions is investigated by disturbing altitude, flight path angle, and battery capacity consumption. The resultant multiple operating lines further formulate higher-order geometries. Applications to multi-objective optimization of electric propulsion bypass tedious numerical simulations and unnecessary infeasible points, implying the potential of the proposed theory in future design and performance analysis of electric aviation."

Addressing these challenges is crucial for the effective deployment of AVER systems in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">human-computer interaction</i> (HCI) applications, where robustness can significantly impact user experience. This study introduces a novel approach that enhances AVER robustness by leveraging a decoder-like summarizer structure. This structure processes audio and visual content and generates contextual summaries that effectively capture emotional cues even when modalities are degraded. To enhance system resilience against missing modalities, we integrate modality dropout during training, enabling the summarizer to adaptively handle these scenarios. We define the context summary length as the number of learnable query tokens used in the summarizer, a fixed hyperparameter in our model. We analyze how varying context summary lengths affect performance, identifying an optimal balance between compression and expressiveness. In addition to improving robustness, we systematically evaluate model calibration across emotions in current <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">state-of-the-art</i> (SOTA) AVER methods.

Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of different context lengths on our summarizer structure in terms of overall AVER performance."

    "abstract": "Coverage control for a mobile sensor network with limited interaction ranges and position measurement errors is addressed in this paper. Different from the existing works, the sensors' interaction ranges are allowed to be nonidentical, which is more general and often results in a directed time-varying interaction topology of the sensor network. A distributed switching coverage control law is proposed, under which the network connectivity of the sensors does not need to be maintained. Then, the convergence of the sensor network is shown by using limit theory instead of Lyapunov stability theory. It is demonstrated that the sensor network can be guided to the configuration minimizing a coverage cost function if the sensor's interaction ranges are larger than given thresholds. Otherwise, an upper bound on the coverage cost function as time approaches infinity is presented. The validity of the proposed coverage control law is finally illustrated through a numerical example."

The bushing endures prolonged exposure to high voltage, large current, and high-order harmonics during operation, leading to frequent failures. particularly defects in strap contacts constitute a predominant cause of valve side bushing failures. As an essential electrical connection structure within bushing, the contact performance of strap contacts is intrinsically linked to bushing stability. This review synthesizes recent advancements in Multiphysics coupling simulations, electrical contact performance analysis, and corrosion failure mechanisms related to strap contacts. Ultimately, valuable future research directions for strap contacts are summarized, providing technical support for the insulation design of valve side bushing in high voltage direct current (HVDC) projects."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative design space exploration of fast Fourier transform (FFT) architectures and numerical formats for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar processing on system-on-chip (SoC) platforms. Three hardware architectures were implemented and evaluated: a memory-based single-butterfly (SB) architecture, a pipelined single-path delay-feedback (SDF) architecture, and a parallel systolic-array (SA) architecture. Two numerical formats–32-bit fixed-point (FX32) and 16-bit half-precision floating-point (FP16)–were compared in terms of latency, throughput, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experimental results show that the SB architecture achieves the highest resource efficiency, processing 43.72 MFrame/s per LUT and 13.68 KFrame/s per DSP in FX32, and 37.60 MFrame/s per LUT and 35.10 KFrame/s per DSP in FP16. While FP16 slightly increases LUT utilization, it significantly enhances efficiency in DSP, FF, and BRAM resources, leading to more balanced hardware utilization overall. The SA architecture delivers the shortest latency and reducing range–Doppler-map (RDM) generation time by approximately 15.61% compared with SB, albeit at the cost of over 8.9× LUT and 6.5× DSP consumption. The SDF architecture achieves moderate throughput suitable for streaming but is constrained by memory bandwidth in SoC environments. From an architectural perspective, the SB design provides the best hardware efficiency, whereas from a numerical-format perspective, FP16 offers the most favorable trade-off between precision and resource usage. At the system level, increasing the AXI data width improved processing speed by 20–26%, while burst length tuning provided smaller gains of 4–5%. The results presented in this work provide practical design guidelines for implementing efficient FFT accelerators in SoC-based FMCW radar systems."

Through an analytical model and numerical simulations, the study evaluates how varying the initial backoff window size, sensing slots, and slot duration affects channel access fairness. Results demonstrate that increasing backoff values and sensing periods, as well as adopting higher numerologies, enhance fair coexistence and mitigate NRU aggressiveness in spectrum sharing. The findings support the dynamic tuning of NR-U parameters to guarantee 3GPP fairness without compromising performance."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), driven by applications such as smart cities and smart homes, demands wireless communication capable of handling large data volumes with efficiency. Low-Powered Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as LoRaWAN offer long-range, low-power connectivity, using adaptive transmission based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). However, increasing device density in unlicensed bands causes interference and network congestion. Cognitive Radio (CR) frameworks address this problem by enabling dynamic parameter adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Low-Pass Filter Mechanism (LPFM) to enhance SNR estimation and reduce packet loss in LoRa-based applications. An experiment in a controlled testbed environment demonstrated that the proposed LPFM improved the balance between network adaptability and stability compared to regression-based LR-ADR. The proposed LPFM mechanism achieved 59.3% higher average SNR gain postreconfiguration and reduced the total number of frequency band shifts by 8.53% compared to LR-ADR. By smoothing transient noise while remaining responsive to persistent channel degradation, LPFM enhanced link reliability, minimizing disruptive parameter changes."

    "abstract": "The evolution of mobile networks has faced the persistent challenge of extending coverage in remote and underserved areas. The advent of fifth-generation (5 G) systems with the 3GPP Release 15 in 2018 enabled new services and applications, yet terrestrial networks remain limited in both capacity and coverage. To address this limitation, Non-terrestrial Networks (NTNs) have emerged as a promising solution, lever-aging Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, as well as High-Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS), to extended connectivity beyond terrestrial infrastructures. Standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in Release 17, NB-IoT and eMTC technologies were adapted to support NTN operation, ensuring seamless integration with terrestrial networks while still undergoing validation and optimization before large-scale deployment. This paper evaluates the performance of Short Message Service (SMS) over Narrowband NTN (NB-NTN) using smartphones connected exclusively via satellite links. Experiments were carried out in a laboratory-based testbed replicating real-world conditions, comparing transmissions with and without Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ). Results indicate that HARQ does not significantly impact device energy consumption, while message delivery latency remains mainly dominated by satellite propagation delay and SMS size. These outcomes confirm the feasibility of NB-NTN for reliable SMS delivery in remote areas, particularly for emergency communications."
