    "abstract": "Determining the explicit forms and modularity for string functions and branching coefficients for Kac--Moody algebras after Kac, Peterson, and Wakimoto is an important problem. For positive admissible-level string functions for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$, very little is known. Here we apply the notion of quasi-periodicity to a generalized Euler identity of Schilling and Warnaar for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$. For integral-level string functions the classical periodicity reduces the infinite sum of string functions in the generalized Euler identity to a finite sum of string functions with theta function coefficients. For admissible-level, we similarly reduce to an analogous finite sum of string functions, but we also gain an additional finite sum of the form \\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i}Φ_{i}(q)Ψ_{i}(q), \\end{equation*} where the $Φ_i(q)$'s are modular and depend only on the spin and the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s are (mixed) mock modular Hecke-type double-sums and depend only on the quantum number. For levels $1/2$, $1/3$, and $2/3$, we shall also see that the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s give us families of mock theta conjecture-like identities for symmetric Hecke-type double-sums. Our work here focuses on evaluating the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s, and our expressions utilize Ramanujan's second-order mock theta function $μ_2(q)$ and third-order mock theta functions $f_{3}(q)$, $ω_3(q)$, $ψ_{3}(q)$, and $χ_3(q)$."

In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations."

Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds.

    "abstract": "Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS."

Yet, most evaluations rely on static datasets that do not reflect the challenges of mobile use. In this study, we systematically evaluated OCR performance under both static and dynamic conditions. Static tests measured detection range across distances of 1-7 meters and viewing angles of 0-75 degrees horizontally. Dynamic tests examined the impact of motion by varying walking speed from slow (0.8 m/s) to very fast (1.8 m/s) and comparing three camera mounting positions: head-mounted, shoulder-mounted, and hand-held. We evaluated both a smartphone and smart glasses, using the phone's main and ultra-wide cameras. Four OCR engines were benchmarked to assess accuracy at different distances and viewing angles: Google Vision, PaddleOCR 3.0, EasyOCR, and Tesseract. PaddleOCR 3.0 was then used to evaluate accuracy at different walking speeds. Accuracy was computed at the character level using the Levenshtein ratio against manually defined ground truth. Results showed that recognition accuracy declined with increased walking speed and wider viewing angles. Google Vision achieved the highest overall accuracy, with PaddleOCR close behind as the strongest open-source alternative. Across devices, the phone's main camera achieved the highest accuracy, and a shoulder-mounted placement yielded the highest average among body positions; however, differences among shoulder, head, and hand were not statistically significant."

However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods.

An analogous characterization is obtained for bounded, convex, causally convex domains in terms of the stable acausality of their Geroch--Kronheimer--Penrose causal boundaries. Our approach is based on explicit comparisons between the Markowitz metric, the Sormani--Vega null distance and the quasi-hyperbolic metric. We also make use of dynamical arguments similar to those of Benoist and Zimmer in projective and complex geometry. Finally, we compare the Markowitz metric to the Hilbert metric."

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines."

The nature of this difficulty will be laid out at the outset. A resolution then will be presented, in which the Born rule will be lightly amended so as to correctly predict all probabilities. The resolution will have the further benefit of clarifying how quantum theory applies to an array of situations in which the theory can be ambiguous, such as the descriptions of continuous measurements, and of closed systems containing all observers."

We reveal that DLLMs can effectively absorb alignment knowledge from AR-LLMs through simple weight scaling, exploiting the shared architectural structure between these divergent generation paradigms. Crucially, our approach circumvents the high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment and comprehensive experiments across diverse preference alignment tasks demonstrate that AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods, achieving 69.08\\% average score across all tasks and models.

Two complementary EFT approaches are developed: (1) A low-energy theory near the $B \\bar D$ ($J=0$) and $B^* \\bar D$ ($J=1$) thresholds, where coupled-channel effects are integrated out; (2) A coupled-channel formulation, where all relevant momentum scales are treated as soft, incorporating contact interactions and one-pion exchange (OPE). Importantly, OPE contributes to the lowest channels only through off-diagonal transitions, thus resulting in the appearance of the left-hand cut from two-pion exchange. The two approaches yield mutually consistent results, supporting the existence of shallow bound states in both channels, in agreement with the lattice findings. The finite-volume spectra and extracted pole positions show a near-degeneracy in $J=0$ and $J=1$ channels, consistent with heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS). Using HQSS, we predict additional shallow bound states near the $B \\bar{D}^*$ and $B^* \\bar{D}^*$ thresholds, which are accessible to future lattice simulations. The effect of OPE on the finite volume spectra is found to be small, with only moderate impact on HQSS partners."

Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes\" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width.

Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration."

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence."

As we are currently near solar maximum, galactic cosmic ray flux is expected to increase as solar activity declines, leading to an anticipated rise in the NIRSpec rate from $2.3$ to $4.3~\\mathrm{ions~cm^{-2}}~s^{-1}$ by early 2027 and potentially reaching $\\sim6~\\mathrm{ions~cm^{-2}}~s^{-1}$ in the early 2030s. We investigate rare, large ``snowball'' hits and, less frequently, events with secondary showers that pose significant calibration challenges. We explore their possible origins as heavy ions, secondary particles from shielding, or inelastic scattering in the HgCdTe detector material. We discuss the implications of these findings for future missions including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope."

In this paper, we develop a unified framework of low-complexity algorithms for SIM-assisted communication systems to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance."

Despite the success of machine learning methods in learning SDE dynamics, existing approaches either require expensive neural network training for score function estimation or lack the ability to handle continuous parameter dependence. We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values."

In this setting, designing efficient no-swap regret translates to sublinear -- in horizon $T$ -- swap regret with polylogarithmic dependence on $N$. In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits. To ground our results, we also demonstrate how to implement the proposed algorithm efficiently -- that is, with a per-iteration complexity that also scales polylogarithmically in $N$ -- across a wide range of well-studied applications."

The guiding thread is methodological: accept the stubborn features of the data and use models as instruments for intuition rather than as axiomatic certificates of truth. In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates."

Here, we show that the recently discovered Mie voids overcome this limitation by supporting a broadband generalized Kerker effect spanning the whole visible range. We investigate the optical response of Mie voids under both plane-wave and dipolar excitation. For plane waves, the voids preferentially scatter light in the forward direction. Under dipolar excitation, the resulting radiation emission towards the void and beyond is suppressed due to destructive interference between the dipole field with the directional scattered field of the void. These findings identify Mie voids as versatile broadband directional sources, opening pathways for antenna design and energy harvesting at the nanoscale."

The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian."

However, LAR has remained somewhat of a \"black box,\" where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart \"path\" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population \"correlation\" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation. The LAR inference method is studied through simulation and illustrated with data examples."

Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $Δ_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \\le Δ$, so that bulk $Δ(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \\le Δ_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface.

Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\\leq M_{200\\mathrm{c}}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology."

Using temporal supply-demand analysis and moral foundations scoring (eMFD), we examine the dynamics of key electoral issues. Three key findings emerge. First, moralization patterns diverge dramatically by platform: TikTok's algorithm enabled viral spread of moralized abortion and immigration content despite lower supply, while Instagram amplified economic discourse that aligned supply and demand. Second, traditionally \"pragmatic\" economic issues became moralized-cryptocurrency discourse invoked loyalty and authority foundations more strongly than any other topic, framing regulation as government overreach. Third, platforms responded to different events: TikTok surged after Harris's nomination across all topics (96% reduction in supply volatility), while Instagram spiked around cryptocurrency policy developments. Semantic network analysis reveals TikTok's circular topology enables cross-cutting exposure while Instagram's fragmented structure isolates Harris from economic discourse. These findings demonstrate that understanding political moralization requires examining platform-specific ecosystems where architecture, demographics, and content strategy interact to determine which issues get moralized and how moral content spreads."

We aim to improve the distance estimates of Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) and Yellow Supergiants (YSGs) by identifying possible cluster and association memberships. Using these distances, we derived updated luminosities and revised their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Methods. We compiled from the literature a sample of 35 luminous yellow massive stars (YHGs and the most luminous YSGs). We used Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify possible membership in clusters and OB associations. We derived distances by combining the parallaxes of nearby co-moving stars. We independently validated these distances by comparing the stellar radial velocities to the Galactic H I kinematic map. We combined angular diameters and effective temperature values from the literature with the new distances to estimate luminosities. Results. We improved the distance estimates for 28 of the 35 stars through association with co-moving stellar groups. For an additional six stars, we provided distance estimates based on the H I kinematic map. For one star, the distance remains unclear. Most YSGs are members of young stellar populations, while the environments of the YHGs are more diverse, and for some of them, their origin populations remain unclear. We derived updated luminosities for a subset of 20 stars.

To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting. Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $γ_n^{1/6}$, where $γ_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem."

    "abstract": "Experiments suggest that nuclear spins play a significant role in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) near integer and fractional QHE spin transitions, but many of these phenomena still remain to be understood. Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed. Hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins provide a route for observation and control of the parafermion zero modes that can be induced when the domain wall between the polarized and unpolarized regions is placed in the proximity of a superconductor"

One example is twisted THH which is an invariant of $C_n$-equivariant ring spectra developed by Angeltveit, Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson, and Mandell. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of twisted THH, and perform some computations. Specifically, we compute $C_2$-twisted THH of the Real bordism spectrum and show that the $C_p$-twisted THH of geometric ring $C_p$-spectra reduces to a computation of classical THH. We extend the algebraic structure of twisted THH to the twisted Bökstedt spectral sequence of Adamyk, Gerhardt, Hess, Klang, and Kong. We show that, under appropriate flatness conditions and for $R$ a commutative ring $C_p$-spectrum, the $C_p$-twisted Bökstedt spectral sequence is a spectral sequence of commutative $\\underline{E}_\\star(R)$-algebras."

    "abstract": "Object rearrangement planning in complex, cluttered environments is a common challenge in warehouses, households, and rescue sites. Prior studies largely address monotone instances, whereas real-world tasks are often non-monotone-objects block one another and must be temporarily relocated to intermediate positions before reaching their final goals. In such settings, effective multi-agent collaboration can substantially reduce the time required to complete tasks. This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world multi-agent system under different configurations, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness."

However, these web-scale corpora inevitably contain large amounts of noisy data due to unregulated web content or randomness inherent in data. Although LLM pretrainers often speculate that such noise contributes to instabilities in large-scale LLM pretraining and, in the worst cases, loss divergence, this phenomenon remains poorly understood.In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of whether noisy data causes LLM pretraining divergences and how it does so. By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes. Together, these results provide a large-scale, controlled characterization of how noisy data affects loss divergence in LLM pretraining."

We conduct a discourse analysis of 31 episodes from five popular data visualization podcasts. Podcasts are public-facing and inherently performative: guests manage impressions, articulate values, and model \"good practice\" for broad audiences. We use this performative setting to examine how legitimacy, identity, and practice are negotiated in community talk. We show that \"inspiration talk\" is operative rather than ornamental: speakers legitimize what counts, who counts, and how work proceeds. Our analysis surfaces four adjustable evaluation criteria by which inspiration is judged-novelty, authority, authenticity, and affect-and three operative metaphors that license different practices-spark, muscle, and resource bank. We argue that treating inspiration as a boundary object helps explain why these frames coexist across contexts. Findings provide a vocabulary for examining how inspiration is mobilized in visualization practice, with implications for evaluation, pedagogy, and the design of galleries and repositories that surface inspirational examples."

    "abstract": "Transformers pretrained via next token prediction learn to factor their world into parts, representing these factors in orthogonal subspaces of the residual stream. We formalize two representational hypotheses: (1) a representation in the product space of all factors, whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of parts, or (2) a factored representation in orthogonal subspaces, whose dimension grows linearly. The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity. This provides a principled explanation for why transformers decompose the world into parts, and suggests that interpretable low dimensional structure may persist even in models trained on complex data."

In this work, we design a *scalable* data-construction pipeline that, with minimal human effort, leverages LLMs to generate a large quantity of high-quality \"**question-proof-check**\" triplet data. By systematically varying problem sources, generation methods, and model configurations, we create diverse problem-proof pairs spanning multiple difficulty levels, linguistic styles, and error types, subsequently filtered through hierarchical human review for label alignment. Utilizing these data, we train a proof-checking RM, incorporating additional process reward and token weight balance to stabilize the RL process.

    "abstract": "Combining human and artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially powerful approach to boost decision accuracy. However, few such approaches exist that effectively integrate both types of intelligence while maintaining human agency. Here, we introduce and evaluate the hybrid confirmation tree, a simple aggregation strategy that compares the independent decisions of both a human and AI, with disagreements triggering a second human tiebreaker. Through analytical derivations, we show that the hybrid confirmation tree can match and exceed the accuracy of a three-person human majority vote while requiring fewer human inputs, particularly when AI accuracy is comparable to or exceeds human accuracy. We analytically demonstrate that the hybrid confirmation tree's ability to achieve complementarity -- outperforming individual humans, AI, and the majority vote -- is maximized when human and AI accuracies are similar and their decisions are not overly correlated. Empirical reanalysis of six real-world datasets (covering skin cancer diagnosis, deepfake detection, geopolitical forecasting, and criminal rearrest) validates these findings, showing that the hybrid confirmation tree improves accuracy over the majority vote by up to 10 percentage points while reducing the cost of decision making by 28--44$\\%$. Furthermore, the hybrid confirmation tree provides greater flexibility in navigating true and false positive trade-offs compared to fixed human-only heuristics like hierarchies and polyarchies. The hybrid confirmation tree emerges as a practical, efficient, and robust strategy for hybrid collective intelligence that maintains human agency."

We introduce a multi-agent prompting framework that breaks down the evaluation process into transcript refinement and criterion-specific scoring. Using 3-shot in-context learning with a large instruct-tuned model, our approach outperforms specialised fine-tuned baselines (Avg QWK 0.62 vs 0.32) and achieves reliability comparable to human experts. We further demonstrate the generalisability of our framework on the ASAP benchmark, where it rivals domain-specific state-of-the-art models without additional training.

We quantify its sensitivity to dynamical dark energy by studying the evolution of $J(a)$ and its derivatives $Γ_1(a)$ and $Γ_2(a)$ across three parameterisation schemes: CPL, JBP, and BA. We determine the characteristic redshift $z_{NG}$, marking the epoch of maximal non-Gaussian structure formation, and the turnaround redshift $z_{TA}$, when information production transitions due to dark-energy domination, finding $z_{NG}\\sim0.81$ and $z_{TA}\\sim0.18$ for $Λ$CDM. Our diagnostics clearly discriminate between thawing and freezing quintessence models and phantom dark energy at low redshifts. Thawing models show small departures from $Λ$CDM, freezing models display higher $z_{TA}$, while phantom models exhibit lower $z_{TA}$, reflecting late-time evolution. We provide a practical prescription for measuring negentropy from discrete galaxy distributions, establishing a framework that can be applied to simulations and observations. This information-theoretic approach offers a robust and complementary tool for probing dark energy dynamics, enabling sensitive discrimination between evolving and cosmological-constant scenarios."

This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

We study a controlled setting in which Llama-3.2 generates samples from a normal distribution by implicitly inferring its parameters (mean and standard deviation) given only samples from the distribution in context. We find representations of curved \"belief manifolds\" for these parameters form with sufficient in-context learning and study how the model adapts when the distribution suddenly changes. While standard linear steering often pushes the model off-manifold and induces coupled, out-of-distribution shifts, geometry and field-aware steering better preserves the intended belief family. Our work demonstrates an example of linear field probing (LFP) as a simple approach to tile the data manifold and make interventions that respect the underlying geometry. We conclude that rich structure emerges naturally in LLMs and that purely linear concept representations are often an inadequate abstraction."

Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms.

Q1: Does TAUT have (p-)optimal proof systems? Q2: Does QBF have (p-)optimal proof systems? Q3: Are there arbitrarily complex sets with (p-)optimal proof systems? Recently, Egidy and Glaßer (STOC 2025) contributed to these questions by constructing oracles that show that there are no relativizable proofs for positive answers of these questions, even when assuming well-established conjectures about the separation of complexity classes. We continue this line of research by providing the same proof barrier for negative answers of these questions. For this, we introduce the SPARSE-relativization framework, which is an application of the notion of bounded relativization by Hirahara, Lu, and Ren (CCC 2023). This framework allows the construction of sparse oracles for statements such that additional useful properties (like an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy) hold. By applying the SPARSE-relativization framework, we show that the oracle construction of Egidy and Glaßer also yields the following new oracle.

    "abstract": "Classical game theory is a powerful framework to analyze the strategic interactions among rational players. However, in many real-life scenarios, players choose actions based on their inherent natural tendencies rather than deliberate reasoning. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to study large population games with an alpha-fraction of rational and (1-alpha)-fraction of herding players. We introduce a new notion of equilibrium called alpha-Rational Nash Equilibrium (in short, alpha-RNE) and discuss its interpretations. Some classical equilibria may disappear, and some new ones may emerge, but only for smaller alpha >0. Interestingly, rational players benefit from the presence of herding and may even achieve utility exceeding the socially optimum. Even more strikingly, in some cases, the herding players also benefit, attaining utility close to the social optimum. We further study the effect of the herding fraction on system performance using measures such as the Price of Anarchy (PoA). In transportation networks, a well-known paradox first studied by Pigou and later by Braess typically arises from rational decision-making: adding an extra link can reduce overall efficiency. Our analysis leads to a different conclusion. When a substantial fraction of users exhibit herding behavior, introducing a new link can increase efficiency, provided herding choices can be suitably influenced. The gains are larger when the herding fraction is higher and/or congestion is lower. By contrast, when herding decisions cannot be influenced, the added link may become detrimental. We also study a bandwidth sharing game in which herding tendencies improve system efficiency. Finally, we discuss the mechanism or influence design in the presence of herding, highlighting both opportunities and risks."

Scaling relations attempt to link the He I signal to XUV irradiation, mass loss, and bulk planetary parameters. We test these relations with a comparative analysis of HD209458b, HD189733b, HD149026b, and GJ1214b using a 1D hydrodynamic, multi-species, full-atmosphere escape model. For the benchmark HD209458b, our previously validated solution reproduces the observed He I and Ha transit depths without imposing composition constraints. HD189733b exhibits comparable He I depths, but the broadest reported profiles require ~12 km/s of additional non-thermal broadening, whereas more recent measurements are narrower, consistent with our predictions. For HD149026b, despite similar system properties, our model shows that higher gravity suppresses escape and enhances diffusive separation, depleting helium at high altitudes and yielding extremely weak He I absorption. For the sub-Neptune GJ1214b, H/He-only models overestimate He I absorption; including H2 and its ions (H2+, H3+, HeH+) lowers the escape rate and modifies the ion/electron balance, reducing the metastable helium densities. Compared against scaling relations, HD189733b observations and our HD149026b prediction fall below the trend, whereas some observations of HD209458b and GJ1214b are consistent; however, the observed transit depths are variable. Across all targets, we find diffusive separation of helium and hydrogen, which may explain why sub-solar He/H ratios are often required in simplified models. We conclude that interpreting He I and Ha absorption requires first-principles models that include self-consistent temperature and velocity profiles, multi-species transport, and molecular chemistry."

    "abstract": "Spatial epidemiology identifies the drivers of elevated population-level disease risks, using disease counts, exposures and known confounders at the areal unit level. Poisson regression models are typically used for inference, which incorporate a linear/additive regression component and allow for unmeasured confounding via a set of spatially autocorrelated random effects. This approach requires the confounder interactions and their functional relationships with disease risk to be specified in advance, rather than being learned from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes the SPAR-Forest-ERF algorithm, which is the first fusion of random forests for capturing non-linear and interacting confounder-response effects with Bayesian spatial autocorrelation models that can estimate interpretable exposure response functions (ERF) with full uncertainty quantification. Methodologically, we extend existing methods set in a prediction context by propagating uncertainty between both the ML and statistical models, developing a new stopping criteria designed to ensure the stability of the primary inferential target, and incorporating a range of different ERFs for maximum model flexibility. This methodology is motivated by a new study quantifying the impact of air pollution concentrations on self-rated health in Scotland, using data from the recently released 2022 national census."

K2.5 emphasizes the joint optimization of text and vision so that two modalities enhance each other. This includes a series of techniques such as joint text-vision pre-training, zero-vision SFT, and joint text-vision reinforcement learning. Building on this multimodal foundation, K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, a self-directed parallel agent orchestration framework that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into heterogeneous sub-problems and executes them concurrently. Extensive evaluations show that Kimi K2.5 achieves state-of-the-art results across various domains including coding, vision, reasoning, and agentic tasks. Agent Swarm also reduces latency by up to $4.5\\times$ over single-agent baselines.

However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation."

Utilizing a unified information-geometric framework, we introduce (Kalman)-Wasserstein-based KL analogues by replacing the Fisher-Rao geometry in the dynamical formulation of the KL with transport-based geometries, and we derive closed-form values for common distribution families. These divergences remain finite under support mismatch and yield a geometric interpretation of regularization heuristics used in Kalman ensemble methods. We demonstrate the utility of these divergences in KL-regularized optimal control. In the fully tractable setting of linear time-invariant systems with Gaussian process noise, the classical KL reduces to a quadratic control penalty that becomes singular as process noise vanishes. Our variants remove this singularity, yielding well-posed problems. On a double integrator and a cart-pole example, the resulting controls outperform KL-based regularization."

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of treatment effect over time is a fundamental aspect of many scientific and medical studies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach under a continuous-time reinforcement learning framework for testing a treatment effect. Specifically, our method provides an effective test on carryover effects of treatment over time utilizing the average treatment effect (ATE). The average treatment effect is defined as difference of value functions over an infinite horizon, which accounts for cumulative treatment effects, both immediate and carryover. The proposed method outperforms existing testing procedures such as discrete time reinforcement learning strategies in multi-resolution observation settings where observation times can be irregular. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can capture treatment effects of a shorter duration and provide greater accuracy compared to discrete-time approximations, through the use of continuous-time estimation for the value function. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistics and apply it to OhioT1DM diabetes data to evaluate the cumulative treatment effects of bolus insulin on patients' glucose levels."

We study $α$-decay half-lives of 178 even-even nuclei within a semi-classical WKB framework using a phenomenological Woods-Saxon $α$-nucleus potential. The potential depth is determined by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition (BSQC), ensuring a physically consistent description of the quasibound $α$-daughter system. To facilitate large-scale calculations, a global parametrization of the BSQC-constrained potential depth is constructed. The resulting half-lives reproduce experimental data with comparable accuracy for both the direct BSQC approach and the fitted prescription, providing a first step toward a global and computationally efficient description of $α$ decay."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis.

Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning."

Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies."

Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow."

In particular we will show how the intersection matrix can detect hidden linear dependencies of the iterated integrals resulting from an $\\eps$-factorized differential equation, which are difficult to find otherwise. Furthermore, we will explain how the intersection matrix can help in deriving (polynomial) relations between the transcendental functions occurring in the rotation to the canonical basis. This allows us to simplify the rotation, and furthermore leads to simplifications in the final result.

This platform is realized using a single-layer dielectric metasurface designed through an end-to-end, task-driven inverse design framework. By tailoring the spatial-frequency components of incident image wavefronts, the metasurface implements analog operations such as edge detection and pattern recognition across a 200nm wavelength bandwidth in the visible spectrum. Furthermore, we develop a compact processor architecture that integrates imaging and computation within a reduced optical footprint. These results establish a flexible and compact metasurface-based optical processor with strong potential for integration into practical imaging and optical computing systems."

This system contains of a compressible Navier-Stokes system for the density and momentum of a fluid, and a transport equation for the potential temperature of the fluid. In stark contrast to the well-known Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system where the temperature satisfies a parabolic type equation providing dissipative effect for the temperature and the density, the temperature in our NST system enjoys a transport equation which precludes a dissipative mechanism for the density, leading to significant different effects to the whole system. We first establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions to the compressible NST system in critical Besov spaces over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 2$. Furthermore, by introducing the Mach number $\\varepsilon > 0$, we rigorously prove the low Mach number limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, showing that the solutions converge to that of the incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system. This singular limit holds globally in time, even for {\\it ill-prepared} initial data. To address the challenge posed by the lack of dissipation on the density and temperature, we develop a refined energy analysis and establish optimal time decay rates for strong solutions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 3$.

Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior. We propose VeriFY, a training-time framework that teaches LLMs to reason about factual uncertainty through consistency-based self-verification. VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source. The source code, training data, and trained model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance."

Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced."

To understand this failure mode, we identify \\emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\\rightarrow$ outputs $\\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions.

To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

    "abstract": "We introduce a general Bayesian framework for graph matching grounded in a new theory of exchangeable random permutations. Leveraging the cycle representation of permutations and the literature on exchangeable random partitions, we define, characterize, and study the structural and predictive properties of these probabilistic objects. A novel sequential metaphor, the position-aware generalized Chinese restaurant process, provides a constructive foundation for this theory and supports practical algorithmic design. Exchangeable random permutations offer flexible priors for a wide range of inferential problems centered on permutations. As an application, we develop a Bayesian model for graph matching that integrates a correlated stochastic block model with our novel class of priors. The cycle structure of the matching is linked to latent node partitions that explain connectivity patterns, an assumption consistent with the homogeneity requirement underlying the graph matching task itself. Posterior inference is performed through a node-wise blocked Gibbs sampler directly enabled by the proposed sequential construction. To summarize posterior uncertainty, we introduce perSALSO, an adaptation of SALSO to the permutation domain that provides principled point estimation and interpretable posterior summaries. Together, these contributions establish a unified probabilistic framework for modeling, inference, and uncertainty quantification over permutations."

Specifically, we report findings from two studies: (1) a reflexive thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses (n = 160), surfacing 38 lived interventions across four categories: environment, organization, task shaping, and personal readiness; and (2) a quantitative online survey (n = 121) that validates this repertoire, identifies which interventions are broadly endorsed versus polarizing, and elicits visions of technological support. We contribute empirical insights into how digital workers cultivate flow, situate these lived interventions within existing literature, and derive design opportunities for future digital flow interventions."

Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware."

We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $ω=-iω_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points. These results highlight Lifshitz holography as an efficient framework for anomalous transport in strongly coupled non-relativistic quantum matter."

    "abstract": "While large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities, they typically operate as static systems, lacking the ability to evolve through lifelong interaction. Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution."

    "abstract": "People navigate complex environments using cues, heuristics, and other strategies, which are often adaptive in stable settings. However, as AI increasingly permeates society's information environments, those become more adaptive and evolving: LLM-based chatbots participate in extended interaction, maintain conversational histories, mirror social cues, and can hypercustomize responses, thereby shaping not only what information is accessed but how questions are framed, how evidence is interpreted, and when action feels warranted. Here we propose a framework for sustained human-AI interaction that rests on invariant features of human cognition and human--AI interaction and centers on three interlinked phenomena: entanglement between users and AI systems, the emergence of cognitive and behavioral drift over repeated interactions, and the role of metacognition in the awareness and regulation of these dynamics. As conversational agents provide cues (e.g., fluency, coherence, responsiveness) that people treat as informative, subjective confidence and action readiness may increase without corresponding gains in epistemic reliability, making drift difficult to detect and correct. We describe these dynamics across micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. The framework identifies four metacognitive intervention points and psychologically informed interventions that provide metacognitive scaffolding (boosting and self-nudging). Finally, we outline a long-horizon research agenda for scientific foresight."

However, existing approaches often fail to generalize in complex, real-world settings due to the highly database-specific nature of SQL reasoning, which requires deep familiarity with unique schemas, ambiguous semantics, and intricate join paths. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage LLM-based framework that decouples knowledge acquisition from query generation. In the Exploration Stage, the system autonomously constructs a database-specific knowledge base by navigating the schema with a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired strategy, generating triplets of schema fragments, executable queries, and natural language descriptions as usage examples. In the Deployment Stage, a dual-agent system leverages the collected knowledge as in-context examples to iteratively retrieve relevant information and generate accurate SQL queries in response to user questions. This design enables the agent to proactively familiarize itself with unseen databases and handle complex, multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy over strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability."

To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks."

Traditionally, position control is assigned to the macro manipulator, while the micro manipulator handles the interaction with the environment, limiting the achievable interaction control bandwidth. To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control. Further we propose surrogate models for a more efficient controller design and easy adaptation to hardware changes. We validate our approach by comparing it against the other control schemes in different experiments, like collision with an object, following a force trajectory and industrial assembly tasks."

Understanding and ultimately mitigating these errors calls for real-time detection of quasiparticle tunneling events on individual devices. In this work, we simultaneously detect quasiparticle tunneling events in two co-housed, charge-sensitive transmons coupled to a common waveguide. We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated. These bursts have a characteristic lifetime of 7 ms and induce a thousand-fold increase in the quasiparticle tunneling rate across both devices. In addition, we identify a rarer subset of bursts which are accompanied by a shift in the offset charge, at approximately one event per hour. Our results establish a practical and extensible method to identify quasiparticle bursts in superconducting circuits, as well as their correlations and spatial structure, advancing routes to suppress correlated errors in superconducting quantum processors."

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

    "abstract": "Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models."

    "abstract": "Important quantum algorithm routines allow the implementation of specific quantum operations (a.k.a. gates) by combining basic quantum circuits with an iterative structure. In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This protocol is called Numerical Error Extraction by Quantum Measurement Algorithm (NEEQMA). NEEQMA concepts are tested on specific instances of Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Hamiltonian Simulation by Trotterization. Knowing theexact convergence constants allows for selecting the smallest convergence parameters that enable reaching the required gate approximation accuracy, hence satisfying the quantum algorithm's requirements."

Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects."

Learning a representation for each node in a knowledge graph allows us to capture topological and semantic information, which can be processed in downstream analyses later. In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks."

    "abstract": "Facial beauty prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to the inherent subjectivity and cultural variation of human aesthetic perception. Conventional deep learning models approach FBP as a standard regression problem, predicting a single, deterministic score for each face. This approach fails to capture the natural disagreement among human raters and can be sensitive to biases within the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that reframes FBP as an uncertainty-aware learning problem. Our method leverages a deep convolutional neural network with dual prediction heads to estimate not a single score, but a full Gaussian probability distribution over the beauty scores, parameterized by its mean (μ) and variance (σ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>). The variance explicitly models the aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the subjective labels. By optimizing the model with a Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss, our framework learns to predict both the most likely beauty score and its associated confidence. This approach provides a richer, more interpretable output, where higher variance indicates greater ambiguity or disagreement in aesthetic ratings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark that our uncertainty-aware model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods, but also provides valuable insights into the subjective nature of facial attractiveness. We achieve a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.925, a Mean Absolute Error of 0.187, and a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.241."

    "abstract": "Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is critical for ensuring software security and reliability; however, current approaches often fall short in capturing comprehensive program semantics. Existing methods typically rely on isolated code or structural embeddings; others apply naive strategies to combine these embeddings, which limits their effectiveness—particularly in complex scenarios such as cross-architecture and cross-optimization binary comparisons. To address these limitations, we propose BinFuse, a lightweight framework designed for high-performance BCSD through the efficient fusion of code and structural semantics. BinFuse introduces a novel Markov matrix construction for fine-grained code feature extraction and employs an enhanced concrete autoencoder (CAE) for optimal feature selection. These extracted features are then assigned as node attributes to construct a fused semantic control flow graph (FSCFG), which is then jointly modeled by a Siamese network to enable accurate and efficient code similarity detection. Experimental results show that BinFuse achieves an impressive accuracy of 96.3% in complex scenarios, significantly outperforming established baselines such as Asm2Vec and Gemini in multiple evaluation metrics. Notably, BinFuse achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art IoTSim while reducing the detection time by 15%. The favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency achieved by BinFuse underscores its potential as a practical and scalable solution for BCSD in complex scenarios, thereby contributing to the development of more secure and trustworthy software systems."

The antenna is formed by two coaxially nested QHA radiators, resulting in a compact size, and each band corresponds to an independent port, avoiding additional diplexers. Unlike previous designs, an analysis method based on generalized multimode (GMM) is developed to evaluate radiators' reflection and inter-radiator coupling, effectively overcoming the coupling analysis complexity of single-end, improving radiation efficiency, and addressing the low-gain issue in conventional nested coaxial QHAs. A prototype operating at 1.575 GHz and 1.995&2.185 GHz achieves more than 17 dB port isolation without additional filters, peak gains of 5.5 and 5.4 dBic, and radiation efficiencies of 81.5% and 80.5%, in close agreement with simulations. More importantly, the proposed design and its analysis method are readily extendable to multi-band, multi-port nested coaxial QHAs, providing a compact, high-performance antenna solution for ASVs and other small-scale autonomous platforms."

The proposed method, which is approximation-free, confines transient performance within a preassigned more flexible region (rather than merely a funnel one) by employing unified performance functions (instead of monotonic functions) to facilitate the output tracking error transformation, the underlying problem is reduced to purely stabilization control for the newly transformed system. By integrating the robust integral of the sign of error (RISE) technique with the backstepping approach, a continuous control law is developed that ensures asymptotic tracking and robustness against uncertainties and disturbances without employing neural or fuzzy approximators, which not only guarantees the boundedness of the closed-loop signals, but also remains the computation complexity at a low level. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through simulation."

Then, a dynamic neural network with nonconvex mappings (NCMDNN) is introduced by integrating structure learning with OMRM control to solve the DDORMPC problem. It employs a velocity-compensated gradient-descent update for accurate online estimation of the system Jacobian, theoretically driving the tracking error to zero.

    "abstract": "Accurate fault diagnosis of electric submersible pumps (ESPs) poses significant challenges, primarily due to two factors: the scarcity of labeled fault samples and the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-sensor monitoring data. To overcome these issues, we propose a Transformerembedded Discriminative Prototypical Network (TDPN). Within this framework, a multivariate time series Transformer encoder (MTSTE) is utilized to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-sensor correlations, thereby generating robust sequential representations under dynamic operating conditions. Based on these embeddings, an adaptive discriminative loss (ADL) is further designed to refine the metric space for few-shot classification. Specifically, ADL minimizes intra-class dispersion through center-based constraints and introduces adaptive interclass margins to enhance discrimination among prototypes. By jointly leveraging MTSTE and ADL, TDPN effectively addresses both the scarcity of labeled data and the complexity of temporal dependencies. Experimental results on real-world offshore ESP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach."

The study responds to a gap in existing maturity models, which are weakly connected to the needs of managers responsible for improving organizational processes, insufficiently practical, and rarely empirically validated. The proposed assessment method integrates diagnostic and recommendation functions and is designed to support both the evaluation of the current state and the identification of actionable steps leading to higher maturity levels. The research follows a design-oriented methodology and combines a systematic literature review, expert assessment, pilot studies, and a empirical evaluation among organizations of different sizes and sectors. The resulting method introduces a structured set of obligatory and optional criteria, as well as tailored recommendations that can be further adapted to the context of specific organizations. Empirical findings demonstrate that users perceive the method as clear, useful, and aligned with organizational practice, and that the recommendations provide meaningful guidance for improvement. The study shows that integrating prescriptive mechanisms with maturity assessment reduces the gap between diagnosis and implementation and enables the design of realistic development trajectories. The article concludes with a discussion of limitations, practical implications, and directions for future research, including sector-specific validation and digitalization of the assessment tool."

    "abstract": "The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-ofthe-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks."

Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information.

The proposed network effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and computationally efficient design. To address class imbalance and enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 by up to 3%. It also has approximately 10 times fewer parameters than the second best benchmark network.

To address the inherent sensitivity limitations of conventional protection schemes based on steady-state quantities, this paper presents a detection mechanism utilizing transient information. A transient zero-sequence equivalent network for single-phase-to-ground faults is established, from which the differential equation of the fault loop is derived to quantitatively analyze the mathematical relationship between transient voltage and current. Based on this analysis, a transient zero-sequence power is defined, and a directional criterion based on short-window integration is developed. This method identifies the fault by leveraging the flow characteristics of electromagnetic energy during the initial fault stage, effectively overcoming the attenuation effect of transition resistance on fault signatures. Theoretical analysis and validation with measured data demonstrate that this technique can significantly enhance the detection capability for high-impedance faults in the $10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ range, providing effective technical support for wildfire risk prevention and control."

However, the link quality (LQ) in mmWave bands is highly sensitive to signal blockage caused by obstacles, making it necessary to predict future LQ and adaptively control wireless communication to maintain stable connectivity. Deep neural network (DNN)-based LQ prediction using physical space information, such as the positions of user equipment (UE) and surrounding obstacles, enables proactive control by anticipating user movement and blockage events. However, the number of blocking obstacles is generally unknown in advance, and conventional supervised learning approaches require separate models for each environment, limiting their scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a common LQ prediction model that can flexibly adapt to environments with varying numbers of blocking obstacles. As an evaluation scenario, we considered an indoor 5G environment where one UE holder and several pedestrians walk, causing two types of LQ degradation: self-blocking due to UE holder and blocking due to pedestrians. Experimental results from indoor commercial 5G experiments under three pedestrian-density scenarios demonstrate that the proposed single model can accurately predict future LQ in all cases. We also analyze the contribution of physical space information, showing that position, direction, and velocity are important for the UE holder, whereas position alone is sufficient for pedestrians."

    "abstract": "Pre-training based deep learning has been used for improving the accuracy of malicious traffic detection. When users use pre-trained encoders to avoid pre-training cost, they may suffer from backdoor attack. In other words, attackers can inject backdoors into these encoders, and trigger backdoors to evade malicious traffic detection. Thus it is necessary to detect the backdoors of these encoders before they are deployed. However, it is challenging, because: (1) traffic triggers are generated dynamically, (2) and encoders output embedding vectors. We hope to use the explanation collapse phenomenon (i.e., backdoor injection changes explanation results) to overcome these challenges. However, existing explanation algorithms are not suitable, because: (1) encoders output embedding vectors, (2) and encoders have no detection boundary. Thus it is necessary to design a special explanation algorithm. We propose MEB, a backdoor detection framework for pre-training based malicious traffic detection. In the detection framework of MEB, we use detection datasets and the explanation algorithm to calculate detection features, and input them into meta classifiers. We detect backdoors according to the prediction results of meta classifiers. In the explanation algorithm of MEB, we calculate the distance between the embedding vectors of explained samples and the embedding vector centroids of benign/malicious samples. We use the gradients of explained samples to the distance to calculate the explanation results. We implement and evaluate MEB in two typical malicious traffic datasets and two typical pre-training algorithms. Experiment results show that MEB can achieve higher detection accuracy and efficiency than baseline detection algorithms."

Among such information, Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) information is particularly critical – without it, reverse engineering and firmware simulation cannot be carried out. However, currently there is no effective tool for identifying the ISA of monolithic firmware. This paper presents an new identification method based on a filter mechanism to address the issue of ISA identification for monolithic firmware. By studying multiple instances of instruction set architectures, our key observation is that certain instructions appear in pairs, and we summarize the concept of Instruction Pairs and develop a mechanism to extract and filter binary blocks, which integrates instruction pairs and the logical correctness analysis of the P-Code Intermediate Representation (IR). Furthermore, we build a prototype of FBFISADetector, a monolithic firmware ISA identification system based on the filter mechanism. This system uses the aforementioned methods to extract and filter binary blocks and determines the ISA of tested firmware by the number of remaining binary blocks. Finally, we evaluate our work, and the results show that: In the test of 870 ARM-Cortex M architecture samples from the monolithic firmware dataset, the identification accuracy reaches 98%; in the test of more than 15,000 ELF files covering 5 ISAs (ARM, RISC-V64, MIPS, POWERPC, TRICORE), the overall identification accuracy is as high as 99%. Meanwhile, we verify the code region hit effect of the instruction pair filtering mechanism and the IR analysis filtering mechanism based on the above ELF file dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the final binary blocks have high credibility regarding their attribution to the current ISA."

    "abstract": "The accurate and dimension-aware modeling of magnetic core loss is fundamentally limited by a trade-off: model-driven approaches are inherently dimension-aware but are often inaccurate; purely data-driven methods are often accurate but lack dimension-transferability. This paper resolves this dilemma by introducing a novel neural-enhanced physics (NEP) paradigm, which enables highly data-efficient adaptation to different physical core dimensions while maintaining high fidelity. We demonstrate this paradigm with the neural-enhanced dynamic circuit model (NE-DCM), where a physics-based circuit handles dimension-aware electromagnetic dynamics while a data-efficient neural network accurately captures complex material hysteresis. This architecture, based on a principled decoupling of physics and material behavior, yields a key practical advantage: a highly data-efficient workflow. The neural network is trained only once using quasi-static data for a given material, while the physics-based model requires only minimal calibration for new core dimensions. Validated on TDK N87 toroidal cores of different sizes under diverse excitations, the NE-DCM demonstrates superior accuracy, waveform generality, and—most critically—data-efficient transferability across core dimensions, outperforming both purely model-driven and purely data-driven models. The extensibility of the paradigm is further confirmed through successful validation on a second, distinctly different ferrite material (TDK T65). This work establishes the NEP paradigm as a robust and extensible foundation for the next generation of magnetic component design tools."

Nevertheless, ICVs have simultaneously emerged as prime targets for cyber adversaries, confronting substantial risks from malicious vehicular attacks. Consequently, establishing robust methodologies to evaluate vehicular trustworthiness and promptly detect malicious entities represents a critical research imperative. To address these security challenges, this work introduces an integrated framework for identity authentication and trust evaluation in ICVs. The proposed solution comprises two core components. The initial component is a privacy-preserving authentication mechanism that safeguards the vehicle’s real identity through the dynamic generation of pseudoidentities, partial keys, and message signatures. Subsequently, a multidimensional trust evaluation model is established, incorporating direct, indirect, contextual, and comprehensive trust factors. This model is enhanced by an adaptive threshold mechanism designed to dynamically discriminate between anomalous and malicious behaviors. Empirical evaluations under common attack vectorsincluding man-in-the-middle, selective misbehavior, and coordinated attacksdemonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. When benchmarked against established algorithms such as BTCMV, MSTFM, and TOW, our method achieves consistently higher performance, with precision, recall, and F-score metrics all sustaining values above 82 percent."

The interface is organized into interconnected dashboards that support two modes of interaction: distant reading, for statistical comparison of corpora, subcorpora, and user-defined sets; and close reading, for detailed visualizations of individual melodies and their associated texts. Synchronized visualizations — including rhythm course plots and sentiment polarity diagrams — allow dynamic filtering by metadata, musical parameters, or lyrical content. Emotion-based analysis, largely independent of language, further opens possibilities for comparative research across culturally diverse collections. Designed for accessibility, the system enables scholars without programming expertise to engage deeply with digitized sources. Grounded in UX research with 47 musicologists and five music theorists, the project demonstrates how integrating text analysis into music digital libraries can enhance search, navigation, and classification, transforming repositories into active research environments that foster discovery, interpretation, and cross-disciplinary inquiry."

    "abstract": "The remote desktop is widely used in enterprise environments. To improve its security, Zero Trust is generally introduced to replace the traditional perimeter-based model with dynamic trust evaluation and continuous verification. However, for the remote desktop system, where access chain topology can be abstracted as a graph consists of users, terminals, VMs and connections between them, classical dynamic trust evaluation approaches rely simply on users’ features collected from user-terminal interactions. They ignore features from remained parts of graph, such as terminal itself (as access medium) and status of virtual machines (as access target). Recent graph neural network (GNN) models are dedicated to fusing features from multiple sources in graph structure; however, they are often designed for low-heterogeneity domains and are thus not well suited to the heterogeneous interactions in remote desktop access. To address these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) framework for trust evaluation in remote desktop systems. In particular, we model users, terminals, and virtual machines as distinct node types and represent their interactions as a heterogeneous graph, upon which we apply HGNN to aggregating multi-type relational information. This enables comprehensive and adaptive trust estimation tailored to the characteristics of remote desktop environments. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in the trust-level prediction task, confirming the effectiveness of heterogeneous graph modeling and neural-based aggregation in improving trust evaluation performance."

This paper develops a comprehensive physical model for a TEC module. Designed with MATLAB Simscape's thermal and electric blocks, it is capable of realistically modeling the thermal behavior for the device with particular interest in cooling performance at disparate ambient temperatures. A critical simplification assumption is to maintain the hot side heat sink fixed at 50°C, thus removing the complexities of temperature regulation on the cold side. To rein in the TEC's operational disturbances and instabilities emanating from the external environment, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control structure is introduced and optimized. Simulation results confirm the PID controller's ability to control the cold-side temperature with superior stability and fast response to setpoint variations and high precision even when subjected to variations in ambient conditions. This work substantiates the validity of the model by employing Simscape to carry out design studies and points out the viability of the PID controller towards realizing high-quality thermal management with TEC-based systems."

Traditional safety evaluations often fail to detect these subtle, context-dependent flaws. To address this, we introduce a scalable red-teaming framework designed to systematically attack and expose latent gender bias vulnerabilities in foundational models. Our framework operationalizes bias as an exploit, leveraging three distinct attack patterns—Latent Bias Elicitation, Forced-Choice Discrimination, and Stereotype-Amplifying Narrative Generation—to bypass safeguards and compel biased outcomes. We deployed this framework in a large-scale offensive campaign against a cohort of globally significant models, including the GPT, Claude, Gemini, and leading Chinese foundational model series. The attacks successfully manipulated all targets into producing statistically significant discriminatory outputs, proving that inherent bias is an operationally exploitable vulnerability. We discovered asymmetric weaknesses: English-centric models were attacked to exhibit strong male bias in Chinese contexts, while Chinese-centric models were vulnerable to similar male-biased exploits across both languages. This work provides concrete demonstration of socio-cultural bias as a potent and scalable attack vector, establishing the necessity of adversarial red-teaming for building trustworthy AI. All attack data and scripts are open-sourced to facilitate further security audits."

    "abstract": "Deep learning compilers are essential for deploying deep learning applications across heterogeneous hardware platforms. To improve execution efficiency, they employ sophisticated optimizations, which inevitably introduce bugs due to their considerably large code size and complex logic. Therefore, effectively detecting optimization bugs is essential to guarantee the correctness and trustworthiness of deep learning compilers.In this paper, we present ORThrus, an automatic approach to effectively detect optimization bugs in deep learning compilers. Conceptually, our approach develops a non-optimizing reference compiler to an optimizing compiler, then to detect optimization bugs by comparing the discrepancies in the two compilers’ outputs. Obtaining a non-optimizing reference compiler is challenging, because existing deep learning compilers provide limited control over optimizations. We thus propose a novel approach dubbed optimization resistance transformation that structurally transforms an input deep learning model from an optimizable form to an unoptimizable form that the deep learning compiler can no longer perform the potential optimizations. We build a prototype for our approach and evaluate it in an extensive testing campaign on two widely-used deep learning compilers TVM and ONNXRuntime. ORThrus detects 21 bugs, of which 9 are non-crash optimization bugs and 1 is missed by the state-of-the-art tool NNSmith even with its cross reference feature enabled. Meanwhile, ORThrus introduces negligible execution overhead."

The digital shadow, a data-driven representation of a physical product, offers the opportunity to capture and analyze these lifecycle data. This paper introduces a methodology to leverage digital shadows for the determination of residual value. By enabling data-driven residual value assessments, the framework supports informed decision-making for economically viable utilization strategies within the circular economy."

In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees."

    "abstract": "With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure l earned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEX- based Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy."

Notably, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where adversaries craft malicious inputs to induce harmful or unethical outputs. In this paper, motivated by the unique effectiveness and scalability of In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs, we explore its potential to modulate the safety alignment of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the In-Context Attack (ICA), which employs harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs' safety, and the In-Context Defense (ICD), which bolsters their resilience through examples that demonstrate refusal to produce harmful responses. By adjusting the distribution of safety in LLM outputs through adversarial demonstrations, our proposed in-context attack and defense facilitate effective manipulation of their alignment. We first provide theoretical insights to illustrate how minimal in-context demonstrations can efficiently alter safety alignment. Empirically, we validate ICA and ICD across multiple models, datasets, and attack baselines, showing their efficacy and scalability for red-teaming evaluations and robust safeguards for real-world deployment. Overall, our work unveils the pivotal yet understudied role of ICL in LLM safety, opening new avenues for understanding and improving them."

Parallel HEVs, in particular, depend on intelligent control strategies to manage the power split between the internal combustion engine and the electric motor, as well as to regulate the state of charge of the battery (SoC). This work aims to evaluate and compare two EMS schemes for an ADVISOR-simulated parallel HEV. One, 'Fuzzy Emissions Mode,' is a rule-based scheme that comes pre-installed in ADVISOR. The other is a fuzzy logic EMS optimized by the author using a genetic algorithm. Simulations were conducted using a programmed driving schedule to measure key performance metrics, including the required torque, power split between the electric and combustion powertrains, evolution of the battery state of charge, and exhaust emissions. The results show that the GA fuzzy-optimized EMS outperforms the benchmark by providing a more balanced torque delivery, improved state-of-charge management, and lower emissions. These findings demonstrate the potential of intelligent optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and sustainability of energy management in parallel hybrid vehicles, supporting the advancement of environmentally friendly transportation technologies."

Our approach constructs a high-quality dataset of 15K Solidity-BPMN pairs through embedding-based clustering, prompt engineering, and multi-template augmentation. We fine-tune DeepSeek-Coder using LoRA for efficient domain adaptation, enabling the model to generate syntactically valid and semantically faithful BPMN structures. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model outperforms GPT-4o, Gemini, and baseline LLMs in both structural precision and semantic fidelity.

Inspired by these advantages, this article investigates the potential applications of IRS in future satellite constellations. We first provide a comprehensive review of satellite communication systems and IRS, along with their capabilities.

    "abstract": "In today’s software development environment, third-party libraries (TPLs) enhance productivity but also introduce security risks. Effective Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is crucial for managing these risks. Yet, existing SCA tools for C/C++ projects struggle with challenges like detecting modified and nested TPLs, precise version representation, and comprehensive TPL databases. In modern software development, third-party libraries (TPLs) are commonly used to boost functionality and save development time. However, this convenience introduces security risks. We introduce OSSDetector, a new SCA tool that addresses these issues. OSSDetector uses sliding window and fuzzy hashing techniques to generate detailed signatures, improving detection of modified TPLs. It features a \"Nested TPL Function Filtering\" algorithm to accurately identify and filter nested TPL functions, and a \"TPL Recognition\" algorithm based on import ratios and function paths to determine the TPLs used in the software. It also addresses version representation by using function weights and release times. To overcome the lack of a comprehensive TPL database, we have developed a large database with 29,416 C/C++ TPLs and 767,405 versions. Experimental results demonstrate that OSSDetector surpasses state-of-the-art tools, achieving better precision (85.52%), recall (79.82%), and F1 score (82.57%), and higher precision (84.27%) at the library version level."

    "abstract": "For pursuing advantages from using branded mobile apps, customers may intuitively, actively, or passively disclose personal information despite privacy risks. The privacy paradox in branded mobile apps is much more severe than in social network sites. We consider contextual factors because privacy protection settings are too complex to be understood. It is a trade-off between outcomes of privacy issues and efforts to deal with them. We consider customers’ need to use branded mobile apps. It is a trade-off between essential/optional benefits and required/additional personal information. Results are from analyzing 482 valid data collected by an online survey. The influence of contextual factors (habit) has the greatest impact, followed by monetary rewards and perceived risks. Habit is external to users’ calculations of privacy risks and benefits. Users may unconcern privacy disclosure because of their habits, they may feel more comfortable and engagement more. Perceived benefit has no significant effect. Privacy fatigue directly and indirectly influences engagement thru perceived risks. Perceived relevance directly influences engagement and perceived benefits. This study presents implications for both academia and practice based on analysis results."

To realize this approach, emulsification, a chemical principle, was applied. This principle allows objects that are difficult to mix, such as water and oil, to coexist. Applying this idea, the study proposes a tool, named learning priority diagram (LPD), with a tree diagram that assists workers in acquiring new knowledge based on their experience. The research begins with describing the concept model to mix knowledge and experience based on the original emulsification process, and then proceeds to develop LPD and initially implement it. Finally, the above trial also confirms the utility of the proposal. The obtained results shows that LPD is effective to a certain extent for initial research purpose, and the requirement of improving the method within a range that do not interfere with the learning process are discussed as future study focus."

However, existing methods often lack fine-grained control over perturbation localization and fail to effectively exploit structural and semantic priors. In this paper, we propose a multimodal adversarial framework termed structure-aware entropy masked attack (SEMA) that integrates structural entropy-guided masking and semantic alignment. By leveraging multimodal information and diffusion-based generation, the method injects perturbations into high-entropy regions to maximize structural disruption while maintaining perceptual fidelity. Furthermore, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis from both topological and embedding perspectives to interpret the adversarial generation process. Experiments indicate SEMA outperforms previous methods on diverse face recognition models, with the attack success rate improved by up to 18.6% in the best case."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack, a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines."

In this study, we demonstrate how Explainable AI methods (LIME, SHAP and SHAP Interaction Quantification) can help maintenance practitioners in refining the understanding of failure mechanisms and root-causes in energy-based maintenance schemes. Using a physically tractable case study of plastic extrusion, we perform fault detection (Autoencoder) and diagnosis (XGBoost) and interpret the results.

TSDs serve as facilities where an external TT can decouple a tractor and chassis with container loaded, with unmanned tractors transporting the containers to the CT, reducing external TT dwell time. In this study, a container drayage model incorporating chassis operations and a CT dwell time measurement model was developed and used in numerical experiments to evaluate the strategy. The results revealed that the strategy reduces CT dwell time and improves TT operational efficiency. The effects were particularly significant in scenarios with severely limited TT availability. Moreover, the study demonstrated that inadequate management of chassis reallocation could result in chassis accumulation within the depot, potentially creating new bottlenecks in the transportation process."

A prominent search-based method, Search-Based Matching with Validation (SBMV), underperforms on citation styles that omit article titles. First, by analyzing large-scale bibliographic data, we quantitatively demonstrate that bibliographic fields, such as author, title, and journal, possess unique lexical features that can be statistically distinguished without syntactic parsing. Based on this finding, we define two new metrics, Candidate Coverage and Reference Coverage, to evaluate the similarity with candidate records. Our framework improves robustness against title-less citation styles, which are challenging for SBMV. Our method predicts the presence of a title based on the lexical features of the reference string and adaptively modifies the validation logic. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional ones, particularly for title-less references. This study represents a step toward a more robust and scalable scholarly information infrastructure."

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of public computing devices (e.g., shared kiosks, medical IoT terminals) in semiopen environments raises critical security challenges for data access control. While Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) enables fine-grained policy enforcement, existing schemes face two key limitations: high computational overhead on resource-constrained client devices and the lack of efficient verification mechanisms for outsourced decryption results from semi-trusted cloud servers. In this paper, we propose VO-PABE (Verifiable and Optimized Public-device ABE), an efficient outsourced CP-ABE scheme with authority-auditable verification. Our approach leverages an optimized bilinear group structure combined with enhanced hash and pairing computation techniques to concentrate most operations within smaller groups, significantly improving encryption/decryption efficiency. Under the public equipment environment framework, VO-PABE achieves secure outsourced computation via novel conversion keys. Furthermore, we design an authoritative verification mechanism using ciphertext-embedded verifiable parameters to ensure the correctness of outsourced decryption results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-PABE reduces user-side computational overhead by 30% compared to state-of-the-art schemes while successfully enabling verifiable outsourcing. Importantly, VO-PABE achieves adaptive security under the Generic Group Model (GGM)."

In this work, we propose Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm that defines security in terms of structurally verifiable resilience against real-world attack surfaces during deployment. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present SEER (Secure and Efficient Encryption-based Erasure via Ransomware), a file destruction system that repurposes and reinforces the encryption core of Babuk ransomware. SEER incorporates key erasure, entropy validation, and execution consistency checks to ensure a well-constrained, auditable attack surface. Our evaluation shows that SEER achieves strong irrecoverability guarantees while maintaining practical performance. This work demonstrates a shift from abstract theoretical models toward practically verifiable implementation-layer security."

Furthermore, the multiple consistent factors are manipulated by a connectivity constraint and fused into a consensus graph with different weights, making the explicit clusters structural and the salient difference between views effectively leveraged. Substantial experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TOOTS model outperforms state-of-the-arts."

We consider a two-tier offloading framework, where each multi-antenna terminal can optionally offload its local tasks to either multiple mobile-edge servers for distributed computation or the cloud server for centralized computation. The above offloading problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming and non-convex problem, which can be decomposed into three sub-problems, namely, distributed offloading decision, beamforming design, and execution scheduling mechanism. First, the continuous relaxation and penalty-based techniques are applied to tackle the distributed offloading strategy. Then, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based lower bound are utilized to design the integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) beamforming. Finally, the other resources can be judiciously scheduled to minimize the maximum latency. A rigorous convergence analysis and numerical results substantiate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate the benefits of multi-point cooperation in cell-free massive MIMO-enabled ICCS and reveal the trade-off between the number of involved APs and the resulting latency, highlighting the inherent interplay among communication, sensing, and computation."

However, Rust programs are susceptible to memory and thread safety issues, making dynamically analyzing Rust issues imperative. Unfortunately, a dynamic analysis framework for Rust is still lacking, hampering the advancement of dynamic analysis for Rust and posing security risks for the language.In this paper, we present RuDyna, the first Rust native dynamic analysis framework to the best of our knowledge. Our framework aims to instrument Rust programs and provide a set of hooks for monitoring runtime events. To this end, we first propose instrumenting the Rust MIR with three rules designed for satisfying its constraints. We then present four instrument strategies to inject various runtime events on MIR. Finally, we develop a hierarchical strategy to instrument configurable hooks to reduce overheads. We implement RuDyna by extending Rust’s official rustc compiler and hooks are provided as a Rust library. We conduct evaluation on a set of micro-benchmarks and 4 real-world large Rust projects. Experimental results indicate that RuDyna preserves the original semantics of programs, with an acceptable runtime overhead ranging from 1.1 × to 3.6 ×, which aligns with built-in instrumentation in rustc and similar frameworks for other languages. Moreover, we implement six analyses based on RuDyna, demonstrating its practical usability."

To address this, we introduce a novel cryptographic protocol ZQ-WMA that enables verifiable and privacy-preserving online learning. Our method integrates zero-knowledge proofs with a quantized version of the Weighted Majority Algorithm, allowing a central aggregator to publicly prove it is honestly combining expert advice and updating weights according to the agreed-upon rules, all without revealing any confidential model parameters.This approach ensures that expert contributions are evaluated fairly and protects valuable intellectual property. Our analysis reveals that the quantization necessary for the zero-knowledge proofs can counter-intuitively enhance prediction accuracy, a phenomenon we attribute to the maximal entropy random walks. Furthermore, our benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of this method, showing proof generation complexity less than 10% of a standard SHA256 hash function, with O(1) proof size and verification time.

To train effective models to effectively predict reproducibility-oriented sentiments and further systematically study their correlation with reproducibility, we introduce the CC30k dataset, comprising a total of 30,734 citation contexts in machine learning papers. Each citation context is labeled with one of three reproducibility-oriented sentiment labels: Positive, Negative, or Neutral, reflecting the cited paper’s perceived reproducibility or replicability. Of these, 25,829 are labeled through crowdsourcing, supplemented with negatives generated through a controlled pipeline to counter the scarcity of negative labels. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis datasets, CC30k focuses on reproducibility-oriented sentiments, addressing a research gap in resources for computational reproducibility studies. The dataset was created through a pipeline that includes robust data cleansing, careful crowd selection, and thorough validation. The resulting dataset achieves a labeling accuracy of $\\mathbf{9 4 \\%}$. We then demonstrated that the performance of three large language models significantly improves on the reproducibility-oriented sentiment classification after fine-tuning using our dataset.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of deep learning-based video forgery, known as DeepFakes, poses a significant threat to information integrity and digital security, particularly in real-time communication scenarios. Existing detection methods often struggle with three critical challenges: performance degradation due to video compression, a limited capacity to detect subtle audio-visual semantic inconsistencies, and excessive computational latency for real-time deployment. This paper introduces a lightweight, multi-modal framework designed to address these limitations. Our method employs a dual-stream architecture for parallel analysis of visual and auditory signals. Key contributions include: a novel dynamic frequency band selection module that adaptively isolates and enhances faint forgery artifacts from heavily compressed video streams; a phoneme-aligned cross-modal verification system that precisely quantifies lip-audio temporal desynchronization to detect semantic mismatches; and a lightweight hybrid architecture integrating ResNet3D and Mamba for efficient spatiotemporal modeling. Validated on benchmarks like CelebDF and FaceForensics++, our method achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off, delivering accuracy competitive with leading methods at a fraction of the computational cost, thus enabling practical real-time deployment."

Experimental validation also illustrates very high test accuracy of 97.97% under 15 N.m load conditions, far superior to traditional classifiers such as Random Forest and Decision Tree, which demonstrate lower performance of 89.19-95.69%, while comprehensive performance metrics comprise precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, further confirming the strength of the framework and its industrial applicability in predictive maintenance systems for high-power rotating machinery in various industrial applications."

The framework acquires voltage, current, temperature, and time-domain waveform data via onboard sensors; performs cleaning, synchronization, and normalization; then feeds the processed streams into a fusion network that uses attention to adaptively weight modalities according to reliability. The diagnostic core is an improved deep model enhanced with transfer learning to remain effective under small-sample regimes and distribution shifts across boards and process corners. In experiments with twelve representative fault types (short, open, and parameter drift among others), the framework achieves 98.7% average accuracy, an 11.3 -point improvement over a single-feature baseline, while keeping end-toend latency under 5 ms on an industrial edge GPU. These results indicate the framework’s suitability for high-reliability, real-time IC testing and maintenance with practical deployment paths in production lines and in-system monitors."

    "abstract": "Binary Code Similarity Detection (BCSD) identifies functions with similar functionality across binaries. Reverse engineers leverage BCSD techniques to locate critical functions in software, thereby compromising associated functional modules. This poses significant challenges for software protection. Although code obfuscation can counter BCSD, existing methods typically apply global, undifferentiated obfuscation, leading to unnecessary code size and runtime overhead. This paper proposes ReinObf, a reinforcement learning-optimized method for lightweight and differentiated obfuscation. In the LLVM intermediate representation of functions, we implement a custom pass to extract statistical and structural features from basic blocks and construct Attributed Control Flow Graphs (ACFGs). A hierarchical RL agent encodes ACFGs using graph neural networks, selects critical blocks and optimal obfuscation methods, then iteratively generates optimized obfuscation sequences that maximize evasion effectiveness while minimizing overhead. Experimental validation demonstrates that ReinObf effectively evades BinDiff, jTrans, CLAP, and Gemini, with an average similarity of 0.391. Compared to OLLVM’s combined obfuscation, it reduces code size overhead by 66.3% and runtime overhead by 34.7%, achieving a favorable security-performance tradeoff."

Combined with the torque balance and energy conversion relationship during the braking process, calculation models for braking distance, temperature change, and braking duration were constructed. Simulation verification shows that the established model can accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of the braking system, providing theoretical support for the optimization of braking performance in flight tests."

Traditional Three-Dimensional (3D) localization methods remain costly due to their reliance on large-scale specialized infrastructure deployments. Achieving a favorable balance between positioning accuracy and infrastructure cost presents persistent challenges in developing practical 3D localization systems. To address the limitation, this paper proposes a low-cost 3D localization algorithm based on error optimal estimation. Firstly, a novel 3D error model is established which uses pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) step-length drift and heading drift to characterize error sources. Secondly, a multi-data fusion adaptive extended Kalman filter (DA-EKF) is proposed which dynamically adjusts error parameters in real-time to enhance positioning accuracy. Additionally, an absolute initial position estimation technique combining PDR and Round-Trip-Time measurements is provided which enhances stability and convergence speed of the absolute initial position prediction. Finally, experiments show 0.081 m line-of-sight (LOS)/1.75 m non-line-of-sight (NLOS) accuracy with 75% fewer base stations (BSs), reducing errors by 77.35% versus baselines."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a popular paradigm enabling clients to jointly train a global model without sharing raw data. However, FL is known to be vulnerable towards backdoor attacks due to its distributed nature. As participants, attackers can upload model updates that effectively compromise FL. More critically, existing defenses are mostly designed under independent-and-identically-distributed (iid) settings, hence neglecting the fundamental non-iid characteristic of FL. Here we propose FLBuff for tackling backdoor attacks even under non-iids. The main challenge for such defenses is that non-iids shorten the distance between benign and malicious updates, rendering them harder to separate. FLBuff is inspired by our insight that non-iids can be modeled as omni-directional expansion in representation space while backdoor attacks as uni-directional. This leads to the key design of FLBuff, i.e., a supervised-contrastive-learning model extracting penultimate-layer representations to create a large in-between buffer layer. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FLBuff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Code is at https://github.com/xingyushu/FLBuff."

To address this issue, a multi-scenario scheduling optimization method for VPP equipment based on association rules is proposed. By analyzing equipment operating data under different scenarios, concepts such as confidence are used to understand association rules, clarifying the operating laws and correlation characteristics of equipment. Using the mined association rules, a multi-scenario scheduling optimization model for VPP equipment is constructed with the goals of minimizing economic costs and maximizing environmental benefits. Based on the optimization model, combined with real-time scenario changes and data feedback, methods such as the roulette selection method are adopted to formulate a rolling optimized scheduling plan, ensuring the reliability and economy of energy supply. Experimental results show that in terms of gas energy output, the total gas energy output in period 1 under high, medium, and low scenarios is $150 \\mathrm{~kW}, 300 \\mathrm{~kW}$, and 500 kW respectively, effectively utilizing energy and ensuring power supply; in terms of user comfort loss, the average loss under the three scenarios is about 4 yuan, 6 yuan, and 8 yuan respectively; in the scenario of high renewable energy output + low load, the incentive cost is mostly between 50 and 150 yuan in each period with small fluctuations, effectively reducing operating costs."

The focus was on 189 final-year students from ten universities, all of whom had taken entrepreneurship and innovation-related courses. The results of data analysis using multiple regression suggests that an entrepreneurial attitude and perceived behavioural control had the strongest and most significant effect on student intention and were the most significant predictors of learning outcome. These findings have implications for improving the design of courses in entrepreneurship to better address the needs of those students who are considering starting their own businesses."

Although full parameter fine-tuning is powerful, it is resource-intensive and can easily overfit on imbalanced data. We propose Adaptive Progressive Fine-Tuning (APFT), a strategy that automates this complex process. APFT employs a staged layer unfreezing process guided by an event-triggered mechanism; instead of relying on a fixed schedule, phase transitions are automatically initiated based on real-time training stability metrics like loss volatility and performance plateaus. Upon transition, a cosine annealing scheduler is re-initialized, and weight decay is adaptively increased to regularize the newly trainable parameters. Experiments on the long-tailed HISTORY-X4 archival dataset indicate that APFT significantly outperforms all baselines, including full fine-tuning and LoRA. The advantage is most pronounced on tailed labels, where our APFT method achieves a $19.9 \\%$ relative improvement in text-to-image $m A P \\text{@} 10$ over the strongest baseline, demonstrating its ability to effectively adapt to new domains while preserving foundational knowledge."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate an air-to-ground (A2G) wireless network system where multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide downlink communication coverage for mobile ground users (GUs). This system accounts for UAVs progressively depleting their energy during coverage provision, ceasing operations when their energy reserves fall below a predefined threshold. We aim to maximize cumulative system throughput over the task period while satisfying the minimum fairness requirement through joint trajectory control and resource allocation (JTCRA) optimization. To meet the fairness requirement, enhancing system robustness is critical; energy-sufficient UAVs must autonomously assist GUs that lose connectivity when their serving UAVs terminate operations. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with a parameter-sharing architecture to solve this problem. As conventional parameter sharing is restricted to homogeneous agents with identical observation-action spaces, we design a dual-agent structure: a trajectory agent (Traj-agent) and a communication agent (Comm-agent) are deployed for each UAV. This separation organizes the heterogeneous tasks of trajectory control and resource allocation into distinct homogeneous agent groups, facilitating effective parameter sharing within each type. Based on this framework, we apply two alternative algorithms: an MAPPO-based JTCRA algorithm and a QMIX-based JTCRA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed JTCRA algorithms, which maintain service continuity for GUs through intelligent trajectory control, thereby minimizing the adverse impact of coverage gaps."

These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a ‘full-stack’ solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools’s ability to meet each step of the full-stack’s requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other’s work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers – providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack."

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for secure medical data sharing and accurate insurance premium assessment, privacy, trust, and interoperability have become pressing challenges in healthcare digitalization. Existing solutions often suffer from centralized control, inflexible access policies, and weak privacy guarantees. To address these, we propose a blockchain-based, privacy-preserving scheme that integrates threshold proxy re-encryption and zero-knowledge proofs. Patients’ encrypted medical records are stored in private cloud environments, while access control is enforced through a threshold proxy re-encryption mechanism. Dynamic rekeying and delegation are supported through re-encryption key redistribution. For insurance verification, we generate zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) based on arithmetic circuits that represent the insurance policy requirements. These proofs are verified on-chain without revealing any underlying medical information. Security and performance analyses demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system. Experimental results show that our scheme supports sub-100 ms re-encryption cycles, reduces zero-knowledge proof generation time by over 90% compared to other zk-SNARK schemes, and imposes low on-chain computational overhead. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and potential suitability for real-world privacy-preserving medical data sharing and insurance evaluation."

    "abstract": "In the formal modeling and verification of trusted concurrent systems (such as distributed trusted computing platforms and secure communication protocols), the complex inter-leaving of behaviors easily triggers state space explosion, greatly reducing the efficiency of model checking. Although Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) can effectively represent concurrent behaviors and data interactions, their models often contain a large number of redundant structures irrelevant to the properties to be verified, thereby impairing the efficiency of verifying the core properties of trusted systems. This paper proposes a CPN model reduction method based on Unrelated Transitions—transitions in the model that have no data relationship with the properties to be verified. By identifying and eliminating behaviors irrelevant to the properties to be verified, the method achieves efficient state space reduction while ensuring the consistency of property verification results, thus providing technical support for the verification of trusted systems. Specifically, through data-flow analysis of property formulas, Unrelated Transitions with no data interaction with the target properties are identified. Then, all behaviors of the reduced model elements are integrated into adjacent model components. On the premise of preserving the model behaviors and their relationships (such as sequence, choice, and concurrency) unchanged, operations including arc expression encapsulation, conditional transfer, and arc redirection are employed to reduce the number of irrelevant nodes while ensuring the model remains connected and executable. Experimental results show that the state space of the reduced model is significantly compressed, and the verification results of the properties to be verified remain completely consistent before and after reduction, which demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method in improving the efficiency of modeling and verification for trusted systems."

    "abstract": "This work investigates thrust vector control (TVC) systems for space launch vehicles using state-feedback techniques and optimal control methods. Classical approaches, including pole placement and the Ackermann method, demonstrated satisfactory stability and control performance. However, optimal strategies, particularly Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Integrator (LQI), significantly outperformed them by yielding lower RMS errors, enhanced stability, improved tracking accuracy, and superior drift reduction. Overall, the study highlights that while state-feedback controllers can ensure acceptable performance, optimal control methods provide more effective and reliable solutions for precise trajectory tracking and mission success in launch vehicles."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "The study explores how the prior interpersonal familiarity in a two-person team influences team situation awareness (TSA) and perceived cooperation during a manufacturing monitoring task. Grounded in TSA theory, it tests whether familiar teams achieve higher situation awareness (SA) and teamwork perception than unfamiliar ones. 20 pairs of participants (10 unfamiliar groups; 10 familiar groups) were recruited to complete a manufacturing monitoring task. Familiar groups outperformed unfamiliar groups in level 1 SA (perception), likely due to shared expectations and coordination habits. Unfamiliar teams demonstrated significantly higher level 3 SA (projection) after collaborative discussion, as they engaged in a more deliberate communication and active coordination under stress. While familiarity supports early-stage cue detection, unfamiliarity may promote deeper information processing and adaptability in complex tasks. Practical implications include combining the stability of familiar teams with structured communication strategies to optimize TSA."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract IMFs, which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-Based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder’s output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score."

To improve the accuracy of the simulation model for bias risk assessment, this paper proposes a sensitivity analysis method for DC bias risk in large power grids. By solving the sensitivities of two key bias risk indicators, the degree of bias risk and its influencing factors have been analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Finally, a case study has been conducted to apply the proposed method. Taking the sensitivity of total DC intrusion amount as the indicator, the degree of DC bias risk has been analyzed, and specific risk management schemes has been discussed."

    "abstract": "Conventional PID and fuzzy PID controllers, the predominant methods for main steam temperature control in thermal power plant boilers, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance in practical applications, characterized by poor step response and inadequate disturbance rejection. This paper proposes a novel control strategy utilizing a Fractional-Order PID (FOPID) controller combined with a Smith predictor. The system was modeled and subjected to one-dimensional simulation in Simulink. The core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of the FOPID controller, which enhances adaptability to complex dynamics through non-integer-order calculus for refined regulation, and the Smith predictor, which effectively compensates for inherent time-delay effects, thereby improving stability, response speed, and disturbance rejection. Simulation results confirm the superior control characteristics of the proposed system. Experimental validation demonstrates a marked reduction in overshoot and significant improvements in both response speed and control accuracy compared to conventional methods."
