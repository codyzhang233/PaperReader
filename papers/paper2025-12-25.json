    "abstract": "This article studies the robust optimal formation control problem of networked fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under communication uncertainties and external disturbances. A learning-based observer–feedforward–feedback control framework is constructed. A resilient self-triggered (ST) observer is designed to estimate reference data while enabling intermittent communication under communication uncertainties. By integrating reference estimation with a backstepping technique, the cooperative formation control problem is reformulated as a robust optimal regulation problem. The robust optimal feedforward control law is learned via an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that exploits the collected internal system data and external disturbance inputs. The stability of the constructed closed-loop control system is guaranteed, and Zeno behavior in the ST rule is avoided. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an experimental study of multiple fixed-wing UAVs."

    "abstract": "WiFi indoor localization plays an important role in many real-world applications and has gained widespread attentions from both academia and industry over the past decade. While existing works have already achieved remarkable performance under various practical scenarios, they solely utilize multiple WiFi Access Points (APs) to achieve a higher accuracy and do not deeply explore the intrinsic relationships among them. To further unleash the potential of multiple APs and reach the limits of WiFi indoor localization, in this paper, we propose Qidi, a novel multi-APs collaboration based localization system. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly reveal three underlying relationships among multiple spatially distributed APs, i.e., consistency, continuity, and non-uniformity. By combining these three basic principles with the unique characteristics of specific tasks, a series of long-lasting practical challenges, such as automatic phase offset calibration, bilateral angle ambiguity, elevation angle estimation with Uniform Linear Array (ULA) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), can be efficiently resolved. Extensive experiments in various complex environments are provided to demonstrate that Qidi can achieve 2.4°, 3.2° median errors of joint azimuth and elevation angle estimation, and 0.4<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i> localization median error even in 20<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>×20<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i> exhibition hall.

    "abstract": "Smart clothing has emerged as a promising IoT-based healthcare platform by enabling distributed physiological sensing through body sensor networks (BSN). However, most systems rely on embedded chips and batteries, increasing complexity, weight, and cost that limit practicality. We present a battery-free chipless smart clothing that integrates thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-encapsulated passive LC relay networks to establish magnetic coupling between an external sensor reader and underlying arteries. Arterial pulsations induce resonant frequency shifts in the coupled system, enabling real-time pulse signal detection. Each sensing coil of passive LC relay networks is positioned at carotid, heart, radial, and femoral arteries, and four pickup coils are routed to a centralized hub on the upper left arm. A lightweight wireless reader with four channels simultaneously acquires multi-site physiological signals. Importantly, passive LC relay networks serve as magnetic field repeaters, enhancing magnetic coupling across extended distances. By matching resonant frequencies of passive LC relay networks and sensor reader at 7.3 MHz, the system achieved a power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 46.56 %, clearly outperforming the capacitor-free configuration, which yielded only 6 %. Notably, a minimum PTE threshold of 0.24 % was established for distinguishable pulse detection. The system showed robustness after water-spray exposure and supported signal acquisition through outer garments up to 21.22 mm thick between sensor reader and centralized hub, confirming resilience to sweat and compatibility with layered clothing. Overall, our battery-free chipless BSN offers lightweight, low-cost, and disposable smart clothing solutions for simultaneous multi-site hemodynamic monitoring, potentially calculating pulse wave velocity for peripheral vascular stiffness assessment."

In this article, a discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) based linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulse waveform is proposed as the ISAC waveform for both uplink and downlink. The generation procedure for this waveform is introduced, and the advantages of it are analyzed and demonstrated by simulation results.

    "abstract": "Due to their stability and robustness properties, Stable Dynamical Systems (SDS) have received considerable attention as a means of representing motions in learning from demonstration tasks. Designing vector fields that fit complex trajectories while ensuring stability still remains a key challenge; although recent deep learning-based methods have shown substantial progress in this direction, their tendency to overfit to demonstration trajectories often leads to undesirable behaviors, particularly as tasks deviate from demonstrations. At a fundamental level, the only reliable way to address this lack of generalization is to provide supervision in out-of-demonstration regions. Focusing on two types of general behaviors, mimicking and contracting, we propose a Behavior-Controllable Stable Dynamics Model (BCSDM), a one-parameter family of SDS that allows users to adjust the system's overall behavior depending on user intent. We show how to extend BCSDM to accommodate demonstrations of multiple tasks, and also propose a Deep Operator Vector Field (DeepOVec) for memory-efficient encoding of multiple dynamical systems. Extensive experiments on tasks that involve mimicking or contracting behaviors demonstrate the advantages of BCSDMs over existing state-of-the-art SDS learning methods."

    "abstract": "Seaweed is one of the leading commodities in the marine sector. The quality of seaweed significantly affects its price and usability, making sorting an important step. However, manual sorting is inconsistent, time consumption, and reliance on human subjectivity. This research aims to design and develop an automated system using a robotic arm equipped with image processing technology based on the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) algorithm. The designed system involves capturing seaweed images, extracting features, classifying the quality using deep learning, and controlling the robotic arm to move the seaweed to containers according to its category. Test results showed that the system could classify good quality seaweed with an accuracy of $93.67 \\%$ (207 out of 221 samples) and poor-quality seaweed with an accuracy of $81.48 \\%$ (176 out of 216 samples). Additionally, the system achieved an operational success rate of $73.33 \\%$ for good quality and $60 \\%$ for poor-quality seaweed. One obstacle encountered was the gripper’s insufficient strength in gripping the object. This system demonstrates that the application of artificial intelligence and robotics can significantly enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of the seaweed sorting process, contributing to the advancement of Indonesia’s seaweed industry."

Efficient multi-class classification algorithms are used, which demonstrate high performance in various tasks. In this report, the problem of multi-class classification of text with the following algorithms was examined, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Network (NN). Mathematical models are created that classify input data into multiple classes. For the implementation of the empirical study, pre-processing of data, feature extraction, and three algorithms for text classification were selected. A comparative analysis of the results was made. The results of the classification show an accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.83, with a maximum of 1. Among the three evaluated classifiers, two of them, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network (NN) have an accuracy of 0.83. The results show that the methods are effective for classifying news by topic."

    "abstract": "Non-technical end-users increasingly rely on AI code generation to perform technical tasks like data analysis. However, large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable, and it is unclear whether end-users can effectively identify model errors - especially in realistic and domain-specific scenarios. We surveyed marketing and sales professionals to assess their ability to critically evaluate LLM-generated analyses of marketing data. Participants were shown natural language explanations of the AI’s code, repeatedly informed the AI often makes mistakes, and explicitly prompted to identify them. Yet, participants frequently failed to detect critical flaws that could compromise decisionmaking, many of which required no technical knowledge to recognize. To investigate why, we reformatted AI responses into clearly delineated steps and provided alternative approaches for each decision to support critical evaluation. While these changes had a positive effect, participants often struggled to reason through the AI’s steps and alternatives. Our findings suggest that business professionals cannot reliably verify AIgenerated data analyses on their own and explore reasons why to inform future designs. As non-programmers adopt codegenerating AI for technical tasks, unreliable AI and insufficient human oversight poses risks of unsafe or low-quality decisions."

A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline was applied, including duplicate removal, filtering of Latin-script entries, elimination of comments without ratings, stop word removal, and stemming, resulting in a clean corpus of 87,884 unique records distributed across five sentiment categories. To address the substantial class imbalance, under sampling was applied, producing a balanced dataset suitable for robust evaluation. The classification task was performed using a stacked ensemble model that integrates Support Vector Machines (SVM), a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with lexicon-based features, and a Random Forest meta-classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that while overall accuracy decreases in the balanced setting, class-level performance becomes more consistent, particularly in minority categories. Moreover, preserving original (non-stemmed) word forms consistently outperforms stemming, especially for mid-range sentiment classes, indicating that morphological richness plays a crucial role in Bulgarian sentiment analysis."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a compact, coefficient-based workflow to transfer wind-tunnel data of a truck-like bluff body to realistic atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) exposure. A neutral log-law wind profile is combined with vehicle motion via rigorous vector composition; integrating the relative-wind kinetic energy over height yields the height-averaged dynamic pressure ${{\\bar q}}$ and the effective center-of-pressure height hcp. The operative yaw β is the sensed angle at hcp, not the meteorological azimuth. Using a stationary Uniform reference with identical (U10, βm) enables transparent ABL-to-Uniform comparisons. For a full-scale truck (H = 4.0 m, B = 2.55 m, L = 12.0 m), ABL shear reduces ${{\\bar q}}$ for given U10 and raises hcp; for moving vehicles the reduction in ${{\\bar q}}$ dominates so roll moments are generally lower under ABL than under Uniform flow at the same external conditions. The method supports engineering assessments, parametric studies, and risk-aware design checks under crosswind."

Dark patterns are UI design choices crafted to manipulate or trick users into actions that are not intended. Scholarship on dark patterns is vastly increasing-however, there is limited work on how dark patterns impact users’ perceptions and interaction with applications. Furthermore, research has yet to investigate dark patterns from the perspective of software engineers who implement UI designs. We explore users’ and developers’ perceptions of dark patterns using a mixed-methods approach, surveying each stakeholder group ($N_{\\text {user }}=66$ and $N_{\\text {developer }}=38$) and mining GitHub data $(N=2556)$. Our findings reveal that dark patterns encountered online leave users with limited or no options for avoidance. Developers report that external pressures influence their decisions to implement dark patterns, and most recognize their adverse effects on trust and user experiences (UX), often reflecting negative sentiments in software projects. Our findings shed light on mitigating deceptive designs in online interfaces that are increasingly essential in people’s daily lives.

In this manner, main idea consists in the differences between probability respect to previous ones, and how it is harnessed for an optimal quantum walk. Essentially, the walk is associated to those space-time where particle is approaching to some target or being far away of it. Thus, the definition of quantum mechanics evolution operator is exploited in order to orient to particle in a most stable state. Because of this, particle’s energy would vary while particle is passing over the allowed space-time points. When energy is much more than allowed to particle, the trajectory is adjusted and the subsequent steps are efficiently reconfigured to the ones where particle would optimize its total energy. An algorithm is proposed and tested."

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ of up to 0.9, ensuring reliable performance.

    "abstract": "District Heating Systems (DHSs) are integral to the energy infrastructure of urban areas, particularly in cold-climate countries where reliable and efficient heating is essential for both residential and commercial purposes. As these systems evolve with the advent of 4th and 5th-generation district heating, traditional reliability analysis methods must adapt to address the complexities of modern DHSs. Therefore, utilities require effective assessment approaches to evaluate the system’s reliability for planning and optimization applications. In today’s context, customer satisfaction is increasingly prioritized, with utilities striving to enhance the reliability of heating supply systems to meet this demand. While reliability indices are widely employed for analyzing the technical reliability of DHSs, they often fall short in assessing the system’s impact on consumers. This paper examines the characteristics of various reliability indices used in system-wise assessments, highlighting the difference between the reliability of heating systems and other energy sectors. Additionally, it introduces new indices designed to evaluate DHS reliability with a focus on consumer-centric aspects. The indices have been used in an illustrative example. The analysis of results demonstrates that the proposed indices effectively assess the customer-centric reliability in different simulated scenarios compared with other system-wise reliability indices. The proposed indices can be integrated into planning and maintenance strategies, offering a more comprehensive approach to the reliability assessment of modern heating systems."

    "abstract": "Remote collaboration software (RCS) tools are widely adopted for global teamwork across professional, educational, and personal contexts. However, no method currently assesses RCS tools for coordination, communication, and collaboration (3C) dynamics regarding cognitive and social complexities that shape user interactions. To address this gap, we developed RemoteCollabEval, a novel inspection method refined through iterative design, combining personas with a specialized walkthrough to identify interface issues hindering effective collaboration, such as differing leadership or communication styles. Unlike user studies, which are costly and time-consuming, our method provides a practical alternative through feedback from interdisciplinary stakeholders during multiple action research phases, including case studies and workshops. Participants found the method thorough and thought-provoking, though some noted the repetitive nature as a potential limitation. This work underscores the need for RCS tools that better support nuanced collaboration dynamics, reinforcing the importance of user-centered design."

We also propose a data-efficient LDM pipeline centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.070. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% and outperforms classifiers trained on images generated by prior state-of-the-art. Classifier training solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to real image training. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric pipeline enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility."

    "abstract": "Automatic detection of motor failures, such as bearing faults, is essential for predictive maintenance across various industries, as bearing faults alone account for up to 51% of motor failures. While vibration-based diagnostics remain the de-facto standard, acquiring reliable vibration data is costly and sensitive to variations of the sensor model and quality, location, mounting and many other factors. To address this, we propose a novel sound-to-vibration transformation method that eliminates the need for onboard vibration sensors. Using any audio recorder (e.g., a mobile phone) and the proposed machine learning model, realistic vibration signals can be synthesized directly from the acquired sound under diverse operating conditions and fault scenarios. Experimental results on the Qatar University Dual-Machine Bearing Fault Benchmark (QU-DMBF) dataset show that the classification accuracy achieved with synthesized signals differs from real vibration data by less than 0.5%, demonstrating negligible loss in performance. This approach offers a low-cost, practical, and scalable alternative for accurate fault detection. The QU-DMBF benchmark dataset, results, and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed sound-to-vibration transformer are publicly available for further research."

    "abstract": "This article presents the mechanism design, balanced walking control strategy, and experimental implementation of a self-balancing bipedal exoskeleton (SBBE) AutoLEE-G3. Based on the anatomical structures of the lower limbs of human, we developed a bioinspired 12 actuated-joint prototype, AutoLEE-G3, which can assist all lower limb joints of the wearer, with motions including hip abduction/adduction, hip flexion/extension, hip internal/external rotation, knee flexion/extension, ankle inversion/eversion, and ankle dorsi flexion/plantar flexion during walking. Subsequently, a viscoelastic-compliance-based balance controller (VCBC) was proposed to reduce the detrimental influence of impact forces on the SBBE's balance performance. Furthermore, the VCBC is based on centroid dynamics, and its control performance is independent of the distributed mass of the exoskeleton and the wearer, which is highly advantageous for the balance control of SBBEs, as the distributed mass of the exoskeleton, particularly that of the wearer, is difficult to measure accurately. Finally, the validity of the self-balancing and locomotion capabilities of AutoLEE-G3 is successfully confirmed through straight-line and turning walking experiments involving both a dummy subject and two human subjects."

The GFEM basis enables the method to deliver high-order convergence rates for this class of problems while adopting uniform meshes. A variational mass lumping method is used to define block-diagonal mass matrices for the GFEM. This approach is not limited to polynomial shape functions like in the FEM and can be used with any element topology. Numerical experiments show that when applied to problems with singularities, the GFEM provides faster convergence than the SEM with interpolation nodes and quadrature located at Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto points (SEM-GLL). It is also shown that the critical time step of the GFEM is larger than for the SEM-GLL on non-uniform meshes designed to recover the optimal rate of the SEM-GLL."

However, due to the uncertainty and scarcity of underwater acoustic target (UWAT) signals, complicated deterministic attention modules increase the risk of model overfitting, resulting in limited improvement or even degradation in the performance of UATR. This letter proposes a Bayesian Hybrid Attention Module (BHAM) that enhances UATR based on time–frequency (T–F) features. BHAM models attention weights as random variables following Beta and Dirichlet distributions to capture uncertainty of UWAT signals and mitigate overfitting, while strengthening T–F feature representation via Bayesian channel attention and Bayesian T–F attention. By learning attention distributions in a Bayesian manner, BHAM effectively models complex dependencies in UWAT signals. Experiments on the DeepShip dataset demonstrate that BHAM alleviates overfitting and generalizes well across different network backbones."

    "abstract": "This study develops and empirically validates an integrative model explaining how firms achieve digital innovation through the interplay among digital strategy, absorptive capacity, digital technology deployment, and environmental dynamism. Drawing on the content-context-process-outcome framework, digital strategy provides the guiding content; absorptive capacity and environmental dynamism act as contextual enablers; and digital technology deployment functions as the central process driving innovation outcomes. Survey data from 250 Chinese firms were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and contextualized and externally validated through cross-case and cross-industry validation. The findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between digital technology deployment and innovation, challenging the linear assumption of prior research. While deployment is essential, overinvestment without strategic alignment leads to diminishing returns, underscoring the need for strategic coherence and absorptive alignment. Digital strategy and absorptive capacity directly and indirectly enhance innovation through digital technology deployment, while environmental dynamism amplifies the strategic-innovation linkage. Theoretically, the study contributes to the engineering management literature by advancing a holistic, dynamic, and nonlinear understanding of digital innovation as an optimization and orchestration process rather than a purely technological one. It offers a generalizable framework that strengthens integrative and system-oriented perspectives in engineering management research."

The model operates with elements called Frames and Channels which depend on each other to the least extent possible. The frame is a self-contained reactive software module that is activated by depending on incoming messages. As the frame is activated, it performs the business logic inside the frame and generates outcoming messages that may activate other frames. The channels are an abstraction for modelling the data exchange mechanism. Each frame may bound to several input channels. The frame is activated/rendered because of receiving the stipulated message from the input channel. Similarly, the frame generates and forward messages into the output channels. One and the same channel can serve as an input channel for a certain frame and the output channel for others. The model has a clear graphical notation that is called the Frame-Channel diagram and therefore facilitates the collaborative development of big software applications."

The proposed control scheme enables a group of three TurtleBot3 Burger robots to maintain a predefined circular formation by tracking virtual leaders defined through geometric coordination laws. The controller computes desired acceleration references for each follower agent using a Laplacian matrix that captures the inter-agent communication topology. These acceleration commands are then mapped into linear and angular velocities through inverse kinematics to actuate the mobile platforms. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategy to correct initial formation errors, ensure inter-agent stability, and suppress oscillatory behaviors along the trajectory."

A large number of normal state samples are used to assist in training to solve the problem of inaccurate prediction caused by the “small-sample” characteristics of the defective state. Then, taking the prediction error as the criterion, a transformer state mutation detection method is proposed to determine the transformer state for selecting the required model during online prediction. Finally, the online monitoring data of dissolved gas concentration in transformer oil collected on site is used for testing. The results showed that the proposed method can adapt to the prediction tasks under normal and defective states at the same time.

    "abstract": "The ARINC-429 data bus remains a widely adopted communication standard in avionics due to its robustness, simplicity, and long certification history. Verification of ARINC-429 devices typically requires laboratory analyzers, FPGA-based controllers, or SoC-based platforms which, are often costly, non-portable, or demand significant development expertise. This paper presents the design and validation of a compact USB-based ARINC-429 verification module that addresses these limitations. The system integrates a Holt HI-3220 transceiver with an FTDI FT4222HQ USB–SPI bridge, omitting FPGA or SoC devices to minimize cost and complexity. A dedicated C# graphical user interface provides plug-and-play usability, real-time bus monitoring, word configuration, and error detection, making the tool accessible for laboratory testing, field diagnostics, and training environments. Experimental validation confirmed full compliance at both 12.5 kbps and 100 kbps modes, with correct signaling, low-latency response, and 99.6% fault detection accuracy. Compared to commercial analyzers, the module is over ten times cheaper, requires less than two minutes setup time, and offers greater portability. The novelty of this work lies in delivering a low-cost, user-friendly verification platform that bridges the gap between traditional analyzers and complex FPGA / SoC-based implementations, making it suitable for laboratories, field diagnostics, and training environments. Results demonstrate that ARINC-429 compliance testing can be performed efficiently using widely available components and an open, accessible design approach, providing a viable alternative to complex or proprietary solutions."

The proposal is developed using a Design Science Research methodological approach, utilizing open-source tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, and Grafana, deployed in a modular architecture with microservices within a virtualized environment that emulates enterprise networks segmented by VLANs. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to consolidate a comprehensive, flexible, and scalable solution that offers features comparable to commercial platforms, while significantly reducing operating costs. The prototype was evaluated using metrics such as resource consumption, ease of use, response capacity to simulated failures, and estimated financial savings. The results confirm the technical feasibility of the solution, highlighting its ability to represent real-time metrics, generate automatic alerts, and improve cybersecurity through proactive visualization of network behavior. Furthermore, the system was positively evaluated by nonexpert users, supporting its potential for adoption in production environments.

    "abstract": "This theoretical study contends that strengthening cybersecurity resilience in developing countries necessitates more than merely technological advancements; it requires a comprehensive understanding of the broader socio-technical landscape. The rapid integration of emerging technologies, including blockchain, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, has created substantial opportunities for social and economic progress, particularly in developing regions. However, this digital transformation is accompanied by significant cybersecurity challenges, such as vulnerabilities to data breaches, ransomware attacks, and the exploitation of inadequately secured networks. This research investigates strategies to enhance cybersecurity resilience by addressing the distinct socio-economic and infrastructural constraints that characterize these regions. Utilizing Activity Theory as a conceptual framework, the study examines cybersecurity not as an isolated technological issue but as a systemic challenge shaped by the interactions between technology adoption, human factors, and policy frameworks. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the necessity of cybersecurity strategies that effectively balance innovation with security while accounting for resource limitations, knowledge disparities, and cultural considerations. The primary contribution of this paper is the application of Activity Theory as an analytical lens for understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks associated with emerging technologies in developing contexts. The findings indicate that prioritizing the development and implementation of scalable, cost-effective, and community-driven security strategies is imperative. Additionally, fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration—encompassing governments, the private sector, and academic institutions—is essential for building a resilient cybersecurity infrastructure. The study advocates for a robust cybersecurity ecosystem that not only mitigates risks but also facilitates sustainable technological growth in developing countries."

Key features include product discovery, shopping cart, payment channel, subsidy distribution, and ASN expenditure monitoring. A usability test with 25 participants showed that the core functionality worked well, as all could complete the task. However, the current study remains at the prototype stage and has not yet been implemented. Further research is needed for larger scalability, longer-term sustainability, and engagement with national MSME systems."

    "abstract": "This work presents a Robust Null Space (RNS) control strategy for hierarchical task execution in multi-robot formations under reference changes. The controller integrates a task-priority null-space framework with a PI-based Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) to enhance tracking performance during reference changes. The proposed scheme addresses two hierarchical tasks: (i) posture regulation as the primary objective and (ii) shape preservation as the secondary objective. Unlike traditional approaches, the RNS controller employs a PI sliding surface to improve convergence and reduce steady-state errors. A Lyapunovbased analysis guarantees the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Experimental validation with a triangular formation of three Turtlebot3 robots shows that the RNS controller achieves up to $26.10 \\%$ improvement in IAE and $4.43 \\%$ in ISE over a traditional Null Space controller, demonstrating its robustness and practical effectiveness. These results not only demonstrate the potential of hierarchical control approaches in multi-robot coordination but also provide relevant tools for real-world applications in logistics, cooperative exploration, and collaborative load transportation, where robustness against disturbances and reference changes is critical."

In this context, the studied company faces difficulties in meeting customer orders due to factors that reduce efficiency, such as machine downtime and rework caused by garment defects. This study aims to increase sewing line efficiency by implementing Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) with IoT to reduce mean time between failures, Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) to decrease setup times, and IoT-enabled Poka-Yoke systems to minimize rework. The proposed model integrates a real-time monitoring system equipped with sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) services, linking Lean Manufacturing practices with Industry 4.0 technologies. As a result, the model improved efficiency in the sewing area from $\\mathbf{7 2. 6 5 \\%}$ to $\\mathbf{8 1. 9 3 \\%} \\boldsymbol{(}+\\mathbf{9. 2 8 \\%)}$). Additionally, mean time between failures increased by $53 \\%$, setup time was reduced by $40 \\%$, and the rework rate decreased by $35 \\%$.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the early identification of businesses at risk of ceasing or limiting their use of point-of-sale (POS) services, resulting in decreased transaction volumes—a key indicator of customer churn. In the highly competitive POS market, customer retention is essential, as acquiring new clients is typically more costly than retaining existing ones. Early detection of potential churners enables targeted retention strategies, enhancing user experience, increasing loyalty, and mitigating revenue loss. To tackle this problem, businesses were first s egmented u sing u nsupervised l earning t echniques, specifically Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and K-Means, based on transaction volume and average amounts. GMM outperformed K-Means and was selected for clustering. Following segmentation, transactional data were analyzed across card types and network levels. Due to the dataset’s class imbalance—with significantly fewer churners—unsupervised anomaly detection methods were used: One-Class support-vector machine, Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). LOF showed the best results, achieving PR-AUC scores of 0.99 and 0.96 for the Micro and Pequeño segments, with recall values of 0.99 and 0.95. For Masivo, Grande, and Mediano segments, lower PR-AUCs (0.71, 0.52, and 0.53) were obtained due to higher false positive rates. Still, their absolute number was small, and they can serve as early warning indicators for proactive retention efforts."

Using a qualitative document analysis of academic literature, DAO governance documentation, IT governance standards (COBIT, ITIL, ISO/IEC 38500), and Indonesian regulatory texts issued by Bappebti, Bank Indonesia, and the Financial Services Authority (OJK), the study identifies critical areas of convergence and divergence. Findings indicate that DAOs demonstrate strong transparency due to on-chain records, but remain weak in accountability, stakeholder alignment, risk management, and compliance. These weaknesses generate friction with Indonesia’s fragmented regulatory landscape, where crypto assets are classified as commodities, prohibited as payment instruments, and inconsistently taxed. Stakeholder management emerges as a pressing concern, as token-weighted voting privileges large holders while Indonesian retail investors face governance literacy gaps. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a hybrid governance framework that integrates IT governance principles with DAO structures, supplemented by compliance mechanisms tailored to Indonesian regulations. Recommendations include the introduction of accountability representatives, adoption of quadratic voting, adaptation of COBIT-based risk management, and establishment of regulatory sandboxes. The study contributes to the discourse on DeFi governance by offering a conceptual model for reconciling decentralized innovation with national regulatory frameworks in emerging markets such as Indonesia."

    "abstract": "Reliable failover performance is a critical factor in maintaining the availability of site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs). This study presents a comparative analysis of failover times among four leading firewall vendors: Fortinet, Check Point, Palo Alto Networks, and Cisco. A controlled test environment was designed to evaluate how different configuration parameters and default settings influence the time required for VPN tunnels to recover after a link or device failure. The results highlight significant variations in failover behavior across vendors, with differences attributed to IPsec rekeying mechanisms, detection timers, and session handling strategies. By identifying the configurations that achieve the lowest failover times, this research provides practical guidance for network administrators and security engineers seeking to optimize high-availability VPN deployments. In addition, the study emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning IKE parameters to minimize downtime. The findings suggest that vendor specific optimizations play a greater role than hardware capacity in achieving fast recovery. Future work may extend this analysis by incorporating cloud-based firewalls and hybrid WAN environments for a broader perspective."

    "abstract": "In the era of information technology, the issue of the relationship between humans and machines becomes particularly relevant. One of the promising approaches in this field is the concept of IT identity. Despite the potential of the concept, it has not gained wide popularity in Russian science: measurement methods have not been adapted for use on Russian-speaking samples, the term is not integrated into the system of psychological concepts, and the relationship between IT identity and related psychological phenomena has not been identified. This study aims to address this gap by adapting the IT Identity Scale to a Russian sample and exploring the relationship between IT identity and temporal focus. The correlation analysis results $(N=195)$ show moderate positive relationships between IT identity and current focus ($\\mathrm{r}=0.195$, $p=0.007$) and future focus ($r=0.191, p=0.008$), but not past focus. Expressed future focus $(\\beta=0.307)$ and reduced past focus ($\\beta=-$ 0.276) make a more significant contribution to the shaping emotional connection with information technologies as a component of IT identity. The results suggest that IT identity represents a completely new type of identity with fundamentally different properties and functions, connecting individuals not with the past, but with the future, shaping interest and readiness for uncertainty. The adapted IT Identity Scale for the Russianspeaking sample opens up opportunities for international research, including its predictors and effects."

Mechatronics, as a transversal field, faces challenges in preparing professionals to design, analyze, and integrate complex systems in dynamic industrial contexts. This paper proposes the Four-Component Instructional Design model ($\\mathbf{4 C}$ /ID), complemented by Cognitive Task Analysis, as a framework for redesigning mechatronics curricula. Existing approaches often emphasize fragmented knowledge or narrow technical training, whereas the proposed framework structures whole-task learning sequences that integrate mechanical, electronic, computational, and control-system knowledge. This fosters cognitive integration, transfer of expertise, and readiness for professional practice. Empirical evidence across STEM disciplines demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of this model. An instructional blueprint is presented to align mechatronics education with industry demands, while recognizing challenges of resource intensity and curricular adaptation. We argue that can enhance student performance, innovation capacity, and professional readiness for complex engineering environments."

The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed human existence and working conditions, particularly within enterprises, by reducing human intervention, thereby increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Despite these benefits, IoT introduces cybersecurity risks that can be exploited by cybercriminals. This study examines IoT and cybersecurity impact in the Namibian mining industry. A qualitative approach was adopted, with data collected through semi-structured interviews with eight mining personnel. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the findings, and four key themes were revealed as follows: IoT deployment in the mining sector, risks and vulnerabilities of IoT devices, challenges posed by cyber-attacks, and cybersecurity strategies for IoT in mining operations. Findings identified IoT devices such as voice hubs, smart TVs, smartwatches, automation systems, and smart lighting as commonly used in the mining industry. The findings also, highlighted key threats including physical tampering, firmware manipulation, and vulnerability exploitation, with challenges ranging from financial losses to reputational damage and risks to individual safety. The study concluded that there is a need for cohesive strategies to improve IoT cybersecurity which must include education and training, contractual agreements, and adherence to policy standards."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel lightweight neural network-PID composite control method to address the challenges of stability in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) wireless communication for UAVs, which are severely affected by nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances in variable-pitch propeller control. On one hand, traditional PID controllers are widely used in variable-pitch systems, but their adaptability to varying flight conditions and external disturbances is limited, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic environments. On the other hand, existing machine learning approaches, while offering better adaptability, often suffer from high computational complexity, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications, particularly for UAVs with limited onboard resources. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in the integration of a lightweight backpropagation (BP) neural network with a PID controller. This architecture leverages the self-learning ability of the neural network to dynamically adjust the PID parameters in real-time, thus improving adaptability and robustness without incurring high computational costs. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a separation strategy for offline training and online inference, significantly reducing the computational load during operation. Additionally, an event-triggered mechanism is employed to optimize the frequency of neural network updates, minimizing unnecessary calculations. By using this proposed system, we achieve better dynamic performance, reduced overshoot, and faster settling times compared to conventional PID controllers. In particular, our method demonstrates superior performance in mitigating speed fluctuations under sudden gust disturbances and adapting to diverse flight conditions. In contrast to traditional methods, which rely on fixed control parameters, the adaptive nature of our approach ensures continuous optimization during flight, guaranteeing improved thrust response precision and communication stability. Experimental validation through simulations and UAV flight tests confirms that the proposed method outperforms traditional PID control in terms of adaptability, robustness, and efficiency."

Pre- and post-test assessments measured confidence, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction using a five-point Likert scale. In the anatomical ultrasound group, confidence improved from 3.08 to $4.53(\\mathrm{p}(\\lt)0.01)$, and satisfaction from 3.68 to $4.48(\\mathrm{p}(\\lt)0.01)$. In the obstetric group, confidence increased from 3.13 to $4.58(p(\\lt)0.01)$, while satisfaction improved slightly from 4.83 to 4.96, not statistically significant. Objective video-based assessments showed a mean score of $2.92 / 3$ among trained students versus $1.47 / 3$ in the control group. Sentiment analysis revealed predominantly positive perceptions: 58% positive in obstetric and 55% in anatomical ultrasound, with overall sentiment scores of 3.5/5 and 3.8/5, respectively. These findings underscore the strong potential of combining high-fidelity simulation and immersive technologies to enhance diagnostic training in medical education."

The framework is composed of five sequential phases-initial definition, regulatory grounding, collaborative construction, refinement, and finalization-and is designed to guide interdisciplinary working groups in producing actionable Policy Papers. These outputs are intended to inform strategic policy innovation blueprints and support sustained dialogue between diverse institutional actors. By combining theoretical insights with operational clarity, the framework contributes to the broader literature on participatory policy design and provides a useful tool for institutions engaged in digital transformation policy development.

Recent incidents of malicious models on repositories like Hugging Face demonstrate that machine learning model platforms are increasingly vulnerable to the same supply chain attacks that have plagued traditional software ecosystems. This paper presents the vision and architectural design for AI4DVault, a comprehensive registry architecture that addresses the unique security, provenance, and integrity requirements of AI4D ecosystems. While implementation remains a work in progress, our proposed architecture defines a cryptographically secure verification protocol that would allow stakeholders to trace model provenance from creation through deployment, protecting against namespace squatting, typosquatting, model confusion attacks, and unsafe serialization formats. The envisioned system would integrate with existing workflows through a standardized command-line interface while providing automated vulnerability scanning and integrity verification to prevent the distribution of compromised models. Our design adapts techniques from established supply chain security frameworks, including SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) and Sigstore, extending them to address AI-specific challenges such as dataset provenance tracking and model lineage verification. We present this architectural vision as a foundation for future implementation efforts, with the aim of establishing a roadmap toward more secure and trustworthy AI4D systems, particularly in resource-constrained environments where traditional security infrastructure may be limited."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in financial transactions is a critical challenge for mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities. This work proposes a robust framework tailored to the cooperative financial sector, leveraging unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalous behavior in transaction data. Hierarchical clustering is first applied to segment users into distinct behavioral groups, enabling the identification of patterns indicative of both normal and suspicious activity. Subsequently, a One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for anomaly detection, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of up to 0.90 in clusters with well-defined transactional patterns. Visualization using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) reveals minimal overlap between normal and anomalous transactions within these clusters, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the model. However, performance decreases in clusters exhibiting higher behavioral variability, highlighting the challenges inherent to diverse financial data. This research underscores the importance of domain-specific anomaly detection strategies and offers practical insights for enhancing fraud prevention in financial systems-particularly within underrepresented sectors such as cooperative banking. Future work will focus on improving scalability and model interpretability to enhance applicability in real-world operational environments."

In response to this situation, the PSICO Research Group set out to design a digital dictionary accessible to the entire Ecuadorian population, including people with visual and hearing disabilities. To this end, several working teams were formed: a group of IT professionals, a team of lexicographic writers, and an advisory group composed of people with visual and hearing disabilities. The dictionary was developed in multiple stages and validated by both users without disabilities and individuals with visual and hearing impairments. The main result of this process is a dictionary composed of $\\mathbf{5, 0 0 0}$ words, each accompanied by definitions and textual citations, 500 of which include Ecuadorian sign language interpretation through videos embedded in a website designed according to screen reader accessibility standards."

    "abstract": "Dementia affects the structure and function of the brain, which significantly impacts the well-being of older adults. Recent research shows that power spectrum and functional connectivity features can serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing and classifying dementia. However, there is still limited research on gender-specific changes in the power spectrum in dementia, especially in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). This paper examines differences in absolute power between male and female participants within each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). First, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) was estimated using Welch’s method. Absolute power was calculated by integrating the PSD within the frequency bands. The analysis was carried out on a publicly available resting-state (RS) eyesclosed (EC) electroencephalographic (EEG) dataset from 88 age-matched subjects. The dataset includes three groups: 36 (12 male) with AD, 23 (14 male) with FTD, and 29 (18 male) cognitively normal (CN) participants. Statistical comparisons were performed using Welch’s two-sample t-test to find significant differences in group-averaged absolute band power between males and females within each band. The results showed distinct band power patterns between genders in each group. Notably, the average absolute power for females in the AD group was higher across all frequency bands except delta, which was lower compared to males. Furthermore, significant gender differences in absolute power were observed within the AD group in the theta $\\left(p=0.02, d=0.59, \\eta^{2}=0.17\\right)$, alpha $(p= 0.01, d=0.73, \\eta^{2}=0.16$), and beta ($p=0.01, d=0.69, \\eta^{2}=0.17$) bands, all reflecting large effect sizes. In the CN group, males exhibited higher absolute mean power in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands; however, in the delta and theta bands, the values were lower compared to females. In the FTD group, males consistently showed higher absolute power than females across all frequencies except in the alpha band, where values were comparable. These gender-based changes in overall absolute power revealed a spectral pattern, highlighting the influence of gender on EEG characteristics in AD and FTD."

This survey synthesizes insights from over 15 peer-reviewed academic sources across sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and medical devices to present a comprehensive framework for service-oriented NPI planning. We identify six core DfS principles, introduce a consolidated set of serviceability metrics, and examine enabling technologies including augmented reality (AR), digital twin platforms, and PLM-integrated feedback systems. The paper contributes a Serviceability Integration Matrix that maps design principles to implementation strategies and measurable field outcomes. By bridging fragmented research domains and quantifying downstream service impact, this survey supports NPI teams in embedding DfS principles early in the product development lifecycle to improve scalability, technician efficiency, and customer satisfaction."

Among critical enabling technologies, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) combined with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has gained considerable attention. In this paper, we address the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem for short-packet communications in UAV-mounted IRS-assisted RSMA networks operating under finite block length (FBL) conditions. Unlike traditional scenarios optimized for long packets, our approach explicitly incorporates the significant impact of decoding errors and strict latency constraints inherent to short-packet transmission. We propose a comprehensive framework that jointly optimizes UAV deployment, IRS phase shifts, transmit precoding vectors, and common rate allocation. The formulated non-convex optimization problem is effectively solved via iterative decomposition and efficient approximation methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in SEE compared to existing benchmark methods, underscoring the efficacy of UAV-mounted IRS and RSMA integration in addressing practical constraints of short-packet communication."

To enhance imaging performance, super-resolution (SR) methods from array signal processing are introduced, enabling high-resolution forward-looking imaging. Among SR approaches, compressed sensing (CS) combined with array radar offers a promising approach. However, conventional CS reconstruction algorithms require prior knowledge of sparsity, which is often unavailable in practice. Although some algorithms, like the sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP), do not require sparsity, their performance can be hindered by ineffective stopping criteria. To address this, we propose a modified algorithm based on SAMP, named MSAMP. MSAMP employs a novel stopping criterion and a more suitable reconstruction process tailored for airborne radar FLI without requiring sparsity. Comparing to some existing FLI algorithms, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and iterative adaptive approach (IAA), MSAMP demonstrates low time complexity and competitive reconstruction performance."

In this article, we propose a novel infrastructure-based anomaly detection framework to identify cyberattacks on CAVs under time interference attacks and vehicle-to-everything communication attacks. The optimal attack strategies are generated using a Pareto optimization that jointly maximizes safety risk and stealthiness. To detect the attacks, a transformer-based trajectory prediction model is developed to predict normal driving behaviors. An XGBoost classifier is then developed to detect anomalies by comparing predicted and observed vehicle trajectories. We validate the proposed framework using real-world trajectory data. The results show that the proposed anomaly detection model achieves high accuracy with low false positive and false negative rates in both offline and online settings. These results demonstrate that smart infrastructure can significantly improve the safety of CAVs by enabling timely and accurate detection of cyberattacks."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the widespread application of Vision Transformer (ViT) in visual trackers, their robustness has received increasing attention. However, by focusing on global interactions between image patches, ViT reduces sensitivity to local noise, posing new challenges for adversarial attacks. Meanwhile, existing decision-based adversarial attack methods often overlook the differences in noise sensitivity between different patches, further limiting the compression efficiency of adversarial noise, especially in ViT. In visual tracking, existing adversarial attack methods primarily target Siamese network-based trackers, and research on adversarial attacks against Transformer-based trackers, particularly decision-based black-box attacks, is still relatively limited. To implement effective black-box attacks on Transformer-based trackers, this paper innovatively proposes patch-based adversarial noise compression (PANC), a decision-based adversarial attack method. This method effectively compresses adversarial noise patch by patch, significantly improving compression efficiency and attack concealment. PANC also introduces a noise sensitivity matrix that dynamically adds and reduces adversarial noise, optimizing the spatial distribution of noise while decreasing the number of queries. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed PANC attack method on several Transformer-based trackers, including OSTrack, STARK, TransT, and MixformerV2, and three public large-scale benchmark datasets: GOT-10k, TrackingNet, and LaSOT. Experimental results show that compared to the existing state-of-the-art adversarial attack method, the IoU attack, PANC compresses the noise level to 10%, improving the attack effectiveness by 162% with the number of queries of only 45.7%. Furthermore, PANC can serve as an initialization or post-processing optimization strategy for other adversarial attack methods, providing a more flexible and efficient mechanism for adversarial example generation. Our work reveals the vulnerabilities of existing Transformer-based visual trackers and offers new ideas for further improving the efficiency and concealment of adversarial attacks."

However, the vastness, complexity, and inaccessibility of these ecosystems significantly challenge their monitoring and conservation. This study introduces an innovative approach developed in the XPRIZE Rainforest competition, combining advanced robotics, environmental sensors, and machine learning to enable rapid and non-invasive biodiversity assessments. The proposed solution integrates ground and aerial robotic platforms with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, bioacoustic recorders, environmental deoxyribonucleic acid (eDNA) collectors, and high-resolution cameras to collect and analyze data on water resources, the forest floor, and the canopy. The methodologies were validated in a 100-hectare tropical rainforest, where they demonstrated scalability, efficiency, and the ability to deliver real-time insights into biodiversity and ecosystem health. The research outlines pathways for empowering local communities and enhancing conservation policies through the acquisition of high-resolution data. As a testament to its impact, the proposed approach earned the Brazilian Team third place in the XPRIZE Rainforest competition, announced at the G20 meeting in November 2024.

    "abstract": "Surgical Visual Question Localized Answering (Surgical-VQLA) is an emerging task that supports surgical education by generating accurate answers and localizing relevant anatomical regions based on visual content and textual queries. This task requires precise spatial reasoning and tight semantic alignment across modalities, which remain challenging for current models due to limited spatial sensitivity and insufficient semantic integration. Mitigating these limitations, we propose EndoVisLoc, a dedicated framework that enhances visual-textual interaction through structured attention and gated fusion. Specifically, we design a Parallel Multi Attention Module (PMAM) to capture different visual features, improving the perception of anatomical structures. We further develop a Dynamic Gated Fusion Module (DGFM) to adaptively inject semantic priors into visual features via gated control, facilitating robust cross-modal fusion. Finally, we introduce a Hierarchical Classifier Head (HCH) to refine the fused representations and jointly optimize answer prediction and spatial localization. Extensive experiments on the EndoVis-18-VQLA and EndoVis-17-VQLA datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EndoVisLoc, surpassing the state-of-the-art OTAS model by +5.72% ACC, +5.73% F-score, and +1.82% mIoU on EndoVis-18-VQLA and by +1.59% ACC, +2.48% F-score, and +0.33% mIoU on EndoVis-17-VQLA. These results confirm the consistent advantage of EndoVisLoc in both answer accuracy and precise anatomical localization.

    "abstract": "For the first time, a novel IGZO channel-based 3D NAND Flash structure with an embedded p-type poly-Si injection layer is proposed, using integrated structural, material, and operational modifications to address the limitations of the conventional IGZO channel-based 3D NAND Flash with p-type poly-si [23, 24]. First, the round shaped tunneling oxide (TNO) was applied to improve program characteristics by suppressing hole tunneling at the cell center. Second, SiO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>/HfO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>/SiO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> tunneling layers were applied to improve erase characteristics through valence band energy offset to suppress hole back tunneling. The erase characteristics were optimized to improve program characteristics by reducing the top oxide thickness (TTO). As TTO decreases, the ISPP voltage required for V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>= 2 V is reduced due to the thinner electron tunneling barrier. Lastly, the optimization of pass voltage to suppress lateral hole spreading further improved the ISPP characteristics by reducing the ISPP voltage required for V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>= 2 V without the pass disturbance. With these combined modifications, the proposed structure achieved the reduction in the ISPE voltage required for V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>= -2 V by -1.5 V and the ISPP voltage required for V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>= 2 V by -7.7 V, compared with the conventional IGZO channel-based 3D NAND Flash memory with p-type poly-Si [23, 24]. As a result, the program and the erase characteristics of the proposed structure were sufficiently improved with the integration of 1) structural, 2) material and 3) operational optimizations compared to the characteristics of the poly-Si channel structure. These results demonstrate that the proposed structure is promising for next-generation 3D NAND Flash memory with more than 500 layers."

    "abstract": "In this study, we introduce MedVisioneer, a lesion-aware deep vision framework designed for enhanced diagnostic assistance in CT image recognition and adaptation, addressing the challenge of identifying clinically significant regions and incidental findings within complex medical imagery. Our approach integrates multi-channel radiological feature representations to effectively characterize scans with intricate anatomical structures. The core contribution is a multi-layer hierarchical model, which simulates radiological search behavior by leveraging lesion-sensitive attention mechanisms. This enables efficient identification of diagnostically relevant regions across varied scales and contexts. Through locality-preserved learning, our model generates clinically plausible scan paths that preserve spatial coherence and prioritize areas aligned with expert visual attention. These attention-guided deep features are incorporated into a probabilistic model for pathological categorization. Extensive empirical validation on our in-house clinical CT dataset and six public medical imaging benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, with significant improvements in lesion classification and image adaptation, as well as superior performance in diagnostic assistance tasks."

    "abstract": "Due to the inherent immutability of blockchain technology, smart contract updates require their deployment at new addresses rather than modifying existing ones, thus fragmenting version histories and creating critical blind spots for analyses. Indeed, for example, this fragmentation severely hinders security researchers’ ability to track vulnerability lifecycles across contract versions. While platforms like Etherscan provide detailed information about Ethereum smart contracts, they lack crucial functionality to trace predecessor-successor relationships within smart contract lineages, preventing systematic analysis of how vulnerabilities emerge, propagate, and potentially remain unresolved across versions.To address the challenge of tracing smart contract lineages, we adopt a Design Science Research (DSR) approach and introduce ContractTrace, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies and links versions of smart contracts into coherent lineages. This tool enables the construction of lineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset specifically designed to support security research on vulnerability, defect or any other property’s evolution patterns in smart contracts.Through a security-focused case study we demonstrate how ContractTrace reveals previously obscured vulnerability lifecycles within smart contract lineages, tracking whether critical security flaws persist or get resolved across versions. This capability is essential for understanding vulnerability propagation patterns and evaluating the effectiveness of security patches in blockchain environments. In the evaluation phase of our DSR approach, we validated our lineage detection methodology against an alternative approach using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to cluster contract versions, confirming the security relevance and accuracy of our technique."

    "abstract": "The acceptance from the end-user of university information systems is an important factor for successful implementation and long-term use. While the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been widely applied to examine this issue. The majority of applications are designed statically, thus failing to account for the shifting relationships between behavioral constructs over time. This paper introduces the use of a system dynamics methodology to represent and simulate the components of TAM within the higher education setting. Using Vensim, a model was developed based on key variables such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward use, behavioral intention, and actual use. Two scenarios were simulated: baseline adoption without intervention, and adoption with a training-based intervention aimed at improving perceived ease of use. The simulation highlights that implementing intervention at the right time greatly accelerates adoption rates. Through this study, it is demonstrated that system dynamics serves as a valuable tool for providing insights that support strategic and policy decisions in implementing digital systems in university."

Here we address the gap by examining whether the combined use of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), digital financial analytics, and E-Commerce is associated with superior firm outcomes. We aim to quantify performance changes and to explain organizational enablers and barriers. We use a concurrent mixed-methods design: a survey of n = 152 textile firms and 12 executive interviews; measurement diagnostics and regression models complement thematic analysis. We find that ERP and digital financial analytics adoption are positively associated with operating margin and inventory turnover; pre/post comparisons suggest higher ROI and lower operating costs in adopters. E-Commerce adoption is associated with higher sales and customer satisfaction, while under-investment in training and cybersecurity persists. We contribute empirical evidence from a Latin American manufacturing context, practical guidance on sequencing investments, and policy-relevant insights for SME digitalization."

    "abstract": "New technologies are consistently integrated into the educational sector to improve its processes and improve learning outcomes. This paper presents a systematic review of the use of robots and artificial intelligence (AI) in education, with a particular focus on systems that incorporate voice recognition or conversational interaction. Educational robots have increasingly supported learning environments, from primary schools to higher education, enhancing motivation, engagement, and participation. Robots with humanoid features and voice capabilities, such as chatbots or speech recognition modules, are especially effective at capturing student attention and fostering interactive learning experiences. The review includes 30 peer-reviewed articles published in the last decade, identified using a PRISMA-based methodology. Studies were selected based on clear methodologies, measurable outcomes, and relevance to general education, excluding medical or highly specialized STEM applications. Mixedmethod analysis combines quantitative assessments of learning gains with qualitative insights into student perceptions. The findings highlight consistent improvements in motivation and classroom dynamics, although cognitive benefits vary depending on educational level, robot design, and integration with pedagogical goals. Limitations include a high reliance on simulations, a strong geographical bias toward English-speaking countries, and a lack of local data sets. In addition, some studies did not find significant learning improvements, highlighting that these technologies should complement rather than replace human teachers. The review identifies future research needs, such as domain adaptation for real-world applications and more extensive studies in underrepresented regions such as Latin America. In general, voice-enabled educational robots demonstrate great potential as interactive learning assistants when thoughtfully implemented, contributing to more engaging, adaptable, and effective educational environments."

It employs a mixed-methodological approach, designing and applying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) tailored to the context of remote work to measure their impact on staff performance. The study combined structured surveys, semi-structured interviews, and statistical analysis of data collected using digital tools, including SPSS, ATLAS.ti, and Google Forms. The results show an improvement in the perception of productivity, work quality, and job satisfaction, specifically in areas related to autonomy, flexibility, and time management. However, challenges related to connectivity, performance feedback, and clarity in the definition of objectives were identified. As a main contribution, a system of indicators adaptable to the human resources department in similar contexts is presented, including quantitative metrics (task completion, absenteeism rate) and qualitative metrics (wellbeing, communication). It is therefore concluded that the use of digital tools and well-structured indicator systems allows for the monitoring and improvement of productivity in remote environments in the post-COVID era."

The main objective is to design and train the robot to perform manipulation tasks in a dynamic environment, using only visual feedback provided by a camera mounted on the end-effector. For the learning process, the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm was implemented, achieving an efficient balance between exploration and exploitation in continuous action spaces. The reward function encourages the proximity of the end-effector to the target plane, correct alignment with it, and collision avoidance. The results obtained after 5000 simulation episodes using the MuJoCo physics engine demonstrated that the robot learned a stable and precise control policy, achieving a success rate above $85 \\%$ and reducing the distance to the target plane to less than 2 cm. Furthermore, the number of collisions decreased significantly during training, indicating that the robot learned to plan efficient and safe trajectories. The proposed approach enables the robot to adapt to variations in the environment without requiring predefined models, enhancing its ability to perform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured scenarios. The contributions of this work open up new possibilities for applying RL in collaborative robotics, with potential for implementation in real-world environments. Future research could focus on the experimental validation of the system on physical robots and the integration of additional sensors to improve environmental perception."

Four compositions were prepared: a control sample with no additive, and three mixtures containing 16%, 24%, and 32% rice husks by volume. Thermal conductivity (λ), volumetric heat capacity (ρ•c), and thermal diffusivity (a) were measured using a transient heat flow method (Izomet 2114 analyzer) under standardized laboratory conditions. The results show that increasing the rice husk content significantly improves thermal insulation. The 24% composition achieved a 29% reduction in thermal conductivity compared to the control (λ = 0.512 W/(m•K)), while the 32% mix yielded the lowest conductivity value of 0.313 W/(m•K), accompanied by a noticeable decrease in thermal diffusivity. These changes indicate improved thermal inertia and slower heat transfer, contributing to more stable indoor temperatures. The findings confirm the potential of rice husk–modified unfired clay bricks as effective, low-carbon, and thermally efficient materials suitable for energy-conscious construction in warm climate regions. Future research will address the mechanical strength and long-term durability to assess their broader structural applicability."

    "abstract": "In recent years, computer vision has emerged as a key technology for autonomous mobile robots and transportation systems, enabling their ability to perceive the environment and make real-time decisions. One of the most critical and widely demanded tasks is object detection, which is essential for navigation, collision avoidance, and the execution of mission-specific operations. This paper examines experimental studies of computer vision algorithms used for object detection in mobile robots. The focus is on the analysis and comparison of modern methods, including classical image processing algorithms and deep learning-based neural network approaches. The experimental study was conducted in a pipeline system to detect in-pipe defects, which requires high accuracy and robustness of algorithms given the limited computing resources of mobile platforms. Experiments were conducted using various object detector architectures (YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN) and lightweight models, such as MobileNet, designed for resource-constrained environments. Algorithm performance was evaluated based on accuracy and processing speed. The results of the study enable the identification of optimal solutions for integrating computer vision systems into mobile robots, ensuring a balance between detection quality and operational efficiency. Furthermore, the study explores the potential adaptation of these architectures for specialized scenarios, such as pipeline inspection, where detecting complex-shaped defects within confined spaces is required."

The applied methods for reactive power compensation and the types of compensating device installed in TPSs were analyzed and relevant conclusions and recommendations are formulated. The main reasons leading to the need to implement reactive power compensators, as well as the criteria for selecting devices, are systematized. In conclusion, dynamic compensation devices are a more correct technical and economic solution, leading to an improvement in the average PF and a reduction in reactive energy costs. For TPSs with suboptimal compensation devices, a detailed study of the electricity consumption should be carried out and options for installing additional modules or replacing the compensation devices with new, more efficient ones should be studied."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a practical and theoretical approach for optimizing the parameters of feeding devices based on the required productivity and specific part geometry. In machine and automation design, selecting suitable parameters, such as the length of linear feeders, is often a complex task. Machine designers commonly rely on empirical knowledge due to the absence of reliable predictive algorithms. A major challenge is ensuring the real productivity of the feeding system matches the projected productivity during the design phase. Systems with higher productivity allow for shorter linear feeders, while lower-productivity systems require longer tracks to provide a sufficient buffer. The paper presents a practical method based on experimental trials to determine the mean productivity and the resulting optimal feeder length. Furthermore, it develops a theoretical framework to estimate feeder parameters when experimental data is not available, considering part geometry, the number of stable states, and the probability of correct orientation. Additional recommendations are provided for selecting appropriate types of linear feeding tracks based on part properties and requirements. Key influencing factors such as part symmetry, surface conditions, and gravitational effects on linear tracks are discussed. Practical advice is offered on how to ensure system reliability by introducing safety margins in the design parameters. The study underlines the importance of early practical validation with real parts to avoid costly design errors. The proposed methodology is applicable across a wide range of industrial feeding systems and supports designers in achieving more compact, reliable, and efficient machine solutions."

In this experimental approach the vehicle-drone system uses near vehicle imagery to assess the situation and to decide, which view the drone must provide for the driver to be shown in a vehicle display. In this procedure, the drone is autonomously flying around the car, creating footage and finally moving to the spot of best view. A field study with off-road drivers will investigate selected critical driving situations, optimal viewpoints and other requirements for a seamless operation. The system created will be used to understand operational challenges of drone-based support of ground vehicle drivers in difficult off-road driving situations."

    "abstract": "The paper aims to present a conceptual model for the evolution from automation to lights-out manufacturing, by combining engineering principles with organizational-behavioral approaches. It is based on the integration of existing theoretical frameworks, models and empirical data from industrial cases published in peer-reviewed journals and industrial reports. The basic idea is that automation is not a static process. The model describes five sequential and interconnected stages (mechanization, automation, digitalization, intelligent automation and lights-out manufacturing) that are rather spiral-like, as each subsequent phase builds on and refines the previous one through feedback loops. In this sense provides a basis for the analysis of real industrial practices that reflect different stages of this transition. The author aims to compare the model with empirical cases and discuss the critical factors for a successful transformation to autonomous production, and examines the practical experience of FANUC, Siemens Electronics Works and Tesla Gigafactory. The comparison of the developed model with the real industrial cases demonstrates a high degree of correspondence in terms of the phases, also the technological, organizational and human axes and the spiral evolution. However, a systematic discrepancy is observed in the social and ethical integration aspects. Most practices emphasize efficiency at the expense of the human-centric approach which requires additional research in the context of Industry 5.0. The application of the model to real cases confirms its validity and analytical value, while highlighting the areas in which the human factor remains crucial - creativity, interpretation and ethics."

This paper presents a structured methodology to detect HIF using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). A realistic distribution feeder from the La Libertad substation in Ecuador was modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, and HIF events were simulated under various non-conductive surface conditions using the Emanuel arc model. The CNN-based model achieved the highest detection accuracy of $99.98 \\%$, with an inference time of 40 ms on a Raspberry Pi 4 embedded platform. The MLP-based model reached an accuracy of $95.03 \\%$, while reducing the inference time to 16.9 ms, making it more suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Also, the implemented algorithms were validated using real oscillographic relay data. The outcomes of this study validate the feasibility of embedding Artificial Intelligence-based HIF detection in edge computing devices, offering a practical and scalable solution to enhance protection capabilities in mediumvoltage distribution networks where traditional schemes often fall short."

The system overcomes fundamental limitations of conventional half-duplex ISAC by eliminating time-division switching overhead and sensing blind zones. Key innovations include: 1) Dynamic waveform adaptation for Doppler-resilient operations in 3D environments, 2) Multi-stage interference cancellation achieving >120dB suppression, and 3) Superimposed waveform enhanced echo analysis in urban multipath scenarios. Extensive simulations and hardware prototypes verification demonstrate significant throughput gains and sub-meter ranging accuracy during high-speed mobility. We further identify critical challenges in volumetric interference management, airborne hardware integration, and cross-domain security, providing a research roadmap for next-generation aerial networks.

    "abstract": "Smart clothing has emerged as a promising IoT-based healthcare platform by enabling distributed physiological sensing through body sensor networks (BSN). However, most systems rely on embedded chips and batteries, increasing complexity, weight, and cost that limit practicality. We present a battery-free chipless smart clothing that integrates thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-encapsulated passive LC relay networks to establish magnetic coupling between an external sensor reader and underlying arteries. Arterial pulsations induce resonant frequency shifts in the coupled system, enabling real-time pulse signal detection. Each sensing coil of passive LC relay networks is positioned at carotid, heart, radial, and femoral arteries, and four pickup coils are routed to a centralized hub on the upper left arm. A lightweight wireless reader with four channels simultaneously acquires multi-site physiological signals. Importantly, passive LC relay networks serve as magnetic field repeaters, enhancing magnetic coupling across extended distances. By matching resonant frequencies of passive LC relay networks and sensor reader at 7.3 MHz, the system achieved a power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 46.56 %, clearly outperforming the capacitor-free configuration, which yielded only 6 %. Notably, a minimum PTE threshold of 0.24 % was established for distinguishable pulse detection. The system showed robustness after water-spray exposure and supported signal acquisition through outer garments up to 21.22 mm thick between sensor reader and centralized hub, confirming resilience to sweat and compatibility with layered clothing. Overall, our battery-free chipless BSN offers lightweight, low-cost, and disposable smart clothing solutions for simultaneous multi-site hemodynamic monitoring, potentially calculating pulse wave velocity for peripheral vascular stiffness assessment."

    "abstract": "Robotic rotational nanomanipulation is crucial in fields like nanomaterial defect detection, nanoscale three-dimensional observation, and nanomaterial twisting characterization. In-situ rotation within a scanning electron microscope is challenging due to restricted workspace, limited field of view (FOV), depth of field (DoF), and large position shifts from rotation axis misalignment. Conventional solutions primarily employ nanorobots with extra structures to align the object with the rotation axis. However, this requires additional motion or observation units for the nanorobot, which either occupies multiple linear degrees of freedom or significantly consumes the limited workspace, thereby greatly impeding the dexterity. The novelty of this article resides in developing a control-oriented discrete time state-space model coupled with systematic calibration methodologies for axis and misalignment quantification. Through kinematic modeling rather than dynamic analysis, this approach enables real-time compensation of positional drift via outer-loop control strategies while maintaining compatibility with confined work space. Subsequently, we propose an iterative learning-based controller to enhance the response in subsequent iterations, thereby achieving high-precision off-axis in-situ rotation. Finally, a Barrier Lyapunov Function ensures the end-effector remains within the FOV and DoF, effectively mitigating visual servo singularities. Experimental validation against PID control and model predictive control demonstrates the strategy’s stability, reliability, and superiority."

    "abstract": "The detection of plant disease using deep learning models has a gain a significant success in computer vision tasks, but even though most models obtain good performance, the application of these models on resource-limited edge devices is challenging. Having a trade-off between accuracy outputs and low computational costs becomes crucial . This research uses transfer learning on the PlantVillage dataset to evaluate six representative architectures. From well know CNNs to the last trending Vit. Beside accuracy, we measure the most important deployment metrics : model size, FLOPs, Parameters, and CPU inference latency. The finding shows us that Swin-Tiny has the highest accuracy ( 98.65%) yet needs huge resources (105 MB, 4.37 GFLOPs) whereas, the lightweight CNN (EfficentNet-B0) gives the best accuracy trade-off. Provides high level accuracy (97.10%) with low computational complexity (15.76 MB, 0.38 GFLOPs)."

    "abstract": "Searching through large number of datasets to monitor the plant, busy and sometimes bad radio traffic, looking for documents and manuals and making knowledge-based plant control decisions are some of the fundamental challenges at field and control room level while running a plant, unit, or an equipment. A digital assistant in tandem with plant control systems, Management Execution System (MES) can play a significant role to address these challenges to run plants efficiently, reduce human efforts and increase the work efficiency. Plant personnel like plant managers, plant operators, control room operators and service technicians in the field benefit from digital assistants by getting the right data anywhere with a single-entry point. Using interaction options such as chat dialogues, QR codes, NFC Tags or voice input enables efficient and system-independent access which enables its users to better focus on the task to be done by choosing the most appropriate method."

    "abstract": "Understanding public perception is crucial for the successful implementation of government policies. This study employs established Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to gauge public sentiment of government policies in Indian context and identify key themes related to policies in the South Karnataka region of India. Traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) along with deep learning techniques such as DistilBERT were explored in uncovering public opinion on government policies under very low training data conditions. Latent themes in the public discourse were identified using K-Means Clustering and BERTopic. Our findings reveal a clear performance trade-off for the highly nuanced task of perception mining, as all the chosen models under-performed under lowdata settings with SVM emerging as the best performing model with a 41.5% accuracy slightly higher than the deep learning model DistilBERT with an accuracy of 40.4%. For thematic clustering, K-Means produced highly coherent and separable topics with 94.6% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying keyword-driven themes, whereas BERTopic identified more semantically nuanced topics that were less distinct."

We analysed 8174 posts from 48 media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (1 Jan-29 Jun 2025). Spanish texts were cleaned, embedded with a RoBERTa model, reduced via UMAP and clustered with BERTopic-HDBSCAN. Thirty-one topics emerged (mean coherence $\\mathbf{C}-\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{0. 5 0}$; diversity $=\\mathbf{0. 8 4}$); five hold 47.5% of the corpus and centre on Daniel Noboa and territorial voting patterns. Posting spikes on 9 Feb, 23 Mar and 13 Apr coincide with the first round, the presidential debate and the runoff, confirming an event-driven agenda. A document map shows dense central clusters for high-volume themes and scattered points for marginal narratives. Content production remains concentrated: three outlets generate nearly one-third of posts and Facebook carries over half the traffic, suggesting that social-platform affordances have not displaced traditional logics of centralisation and candidate-centric framing in Ecuadorian electoral journalism."

    "abstract": "CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are widely used to prevent spam and automated bot attacks. Among these, image-based CAPTCHA services such as hCAPTCHA are increasingly being solved using advanced Deep Learning techniques, notably Residual Networks (ResNet) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). Despite significant advancements, there is a continuing demand for solutions that offer higher accuracy and faster processing times. In this paper, we explore the performance of YOLOv3 and YOLOv10, both sophisticated object detection algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). YOLOv3, leveraging a modified version of Darknet as its backbone, features 53 convolutional layers and effectively addresses image-based CAPTCHA challenges with high success rates. On the other hand, YOLOv10, built on a PyTorch backbone, innovates by eliminating the need for Non Maximum Suppression (NMS) in post-processing. This enhancement, coupled with a novel NMS-free training approach using dual label assignments, significantly improves inference speed without compromising accuracy. We evaluated the performance of both models with over 300 image-based CAPTCHA challenges daily, using a web-integrated hCAPTCHA for login purposes. YOLOv3 achieved a 98% accuracy rate, with an average challenge-solving time of 3.5 seconds, while YOLOv10 achieved 99% accuracy, solving challenges in an average of 2.7 seconds. Remarkably, both systems operated on a local machine equipped only with Intel Core i5-4300U CPUs and 16 GB of RAM, demonstrating their efficiency even without GPU acceleration. To our knowledge, this study is the first to implement an automated hCAPTCHA challenge solver using the YOLO family of models, marking a contribution to the field."

The system aims to support more accurate forecasting of financial aids needs and fund allocation through the integration of descriptive and predictive analytics. The descriptive analysis module presents historical patterns related to applicant demographics, financial status, and regional location, providing valuable insights into past trends. The predictive analysis component employs Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average, Linear Regression, Compound Annual Growth Rate, and Simple Moving Average models to forecast key metrics, including application volumes, levels of study, and fields of interest. The prototype empowers the foundation to make proactive, data-informed decisions by offering reliable forecasts that support strategic resource planning. It marks a shift from reactive reporting to pre-emptive governance in financial aid management. While the current implementation is based on static historical data, the system’s architecture allows for future enhancements such as real-time data integration, broader data sourcing, and machine learning algorithms for improved predictive performance. This work contributes to the ongoing evolution of data-driven educational management, particularly within resource-constrained environments."

To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving machine unlearning (MU) framework tailored for MaaS using the Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) approach. Our framework supports efficient removal of specific user data from trained ML models without requiring full retraining. Our evaluation shows that our framework can achieve high model utility, while effectively handling deletion requests (e.g., achieving a KL divergence of 0.0060–0.0068 and inference false positive rates of 17%–18%)."

The CLC mix was engineered using Portland cement combined with selected chemical admixtures. Thermal conductivity (λ), thermal diffusivity (a), and volumetric heat capacity (c•ρ) were measured to evaluate and compare the two materials. Results show that CLC has slightly higher thermal conductivity (0.1179 W/(m•K)) compared to AAC (0.0906 W/(m•K)), along with greater thermal diffusivity. In contrast, AAC exhibits a significantly higher volumetric heat capacity. All differences between the materials were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Despite its marginally higher conductivity, CLC demonstrates stable thermal performance, low density, and straightforward production, making it a promising option for non-load-bearing or lightly loaded elements in energy-efficient buildings. This work contributes practical insights into the thermal efficiency of lightweight concretes with similar densities and supports informed material selection for sustainable construction applications."

    "abstract": "Programming instruction often focuses on syntax and algorithms. However, mastering programming also requires building strategic knowledge of skills such as debugging, problem solving, and program design. These critical skills are difficult to teach explicitly because they often involve tacit knowledge, context-specific understanding, and adaptive decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be effective in helping with syntactic and algorithmic questions but can fail to provide strategic knowledge. This is partly because strategic knowledge involves nuanced contexts that span code and runtime states, requires subjective judgments, and dynamically evolves based on the outcomes of users’ actions. We introduce Co-Advisor, a context-aware strategy recommendation tool that leverages LLM to evaluate problem context and monitor the programmer’s actions to provide personalized constructive feedback. Unlike prior work, Co-Advisor can dynamically align expert strategies with real-time programmer actions and code context, offering actionable, personalized strategic knowledge. In a formative evaluation with 14 programmers involved in two debugging tasks, we found that those using Co-Advisor to receive context-related feedback alongside expert strategies were significantly more successful than those without context-related feedback. They demonstrated greater engagement and had an improved learning experience, gaining insight into the reasons behind their mistakes, correcting them, and understanding the rationale behind their actions. Thus, Co-Advisor enhances conceptual understanding and strategic problem-solving."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining traction in various hiring-related tasks for both candidates and employers. For instance, employers are increasingly using LLMs to rate applicants based on the match between their resume content and job description requirements. Meanwhile, candidates use LLMs to write cover letters and tailor resume content. However, research shows LLMs can impart biases for LLMgenerated content and against minorities, such as disabled candidates in hiring contexts. Thus, we conduct an observational study to investigate how widely used LLMs - OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude - perform in supporting resume tasks for employers and candidates. Using a real-world dataset of job descriptions and resumes from disabled ($n=$ 209) and non-disabled (n = 209) candidates, we examine the capabilities of these models across resume rating and resume generation tasks in a zero-shot setting. Our main findings show moderate alignment across models for resume matching and no significant differences in ratings between disabled and nondisabled candidates. However, we did observe increased ratings for LLM-generated resumes for GPT-4 and Claude. We discuss the implications for both candidates and employers based on our findings, aiming to promote non-biased and equitable AIbased hiring processes and motivate human-AI collaboration in the design of future hiring systems."

    "abstract": "The general objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between entrepreneurial competence and financial literacy in engineering students from Ecuador and Peru, identifying the differences in their entrepreneurial orientation and the factors that influence the conversion of entrepreneurial intention into action. The research problem lies in the lack of effective integration between entrepreneurial and financial education in university education, which could limit the ability of students to manage successful ventures. A quantitative methodology based on structural equation models (PLS-SEM) and difference of means tests using the Student $\\mathbf{T}$ test was used, with a sample of 384 students (192 from each country). The results show that in Ecuador students have a higher entrepreneurial orientation and financial knowledge than in Peru ($\\mathbf{p}\\lt 0.001$). However, PLS-SEM analysis revealed that the relationship between entrepreneurial competence and financial literacy is weak in Ecuador ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\mathbf{0. 1 6 6}, \\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}=\\mathbf{0. 0 2 8}$) and negative in Peru $\\left(\\beta=-0.233, \\mathrm{R}^{2}=0.054\\right)$, suggesting that financial education is not adequately integrated into entrepreneurial training in both countries. The findings indicate the need to strengthen educational programs so that financial education and entrepreneurial training are complementary, ensuring that students develop entrepreneurial skills along with sound financial knowledge."

    "abstract": "This paper conducts a small-signal stability assessment of power systems with high photovoltaic (PV) plants operating in grid-forming (GFM) mode. The focus lies in comparing two GFM control strategies, droop and virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control, that are implemented in two-stage PV power plants. Modal analysis is performed on a testbed to evaluate the impact of both GFM control strategies. Comparison metrics include eigenvalue trajectories, damping ratios, oscillation frequencies, and participation factor analysis. The effects of the dispatch, weakness, and frequency control parameters on the stability of small signals is studied. Results have shown that both strategies introduce additional oscillatory modes that differ from those in power systems dominated by synchronous generators. Modes near 3 Hz are observed, which respond to systemic interactions of multiple PV operating in GFM. These types of oscillations are novel and can only be identified when the DC side is represented, as they interact with the frequency control in both the droop and VSG control strategies. Furthermore, for all case studies on the testbed, the results demonstrated that VSG allows better dynamic performance in PV plants. These findings underscore the importance of selecting suitable GFM strategies when designing future power systems dominated by inverter-based resources."

    "abstract": "The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is one of the most prominent and extensively studied nonlinear optimization challenges in the field of electric power systems. This study proposes a hybrid algorithm that integrates the heuristic Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) technique with the deterministic Newton-Raphson method, tailored to a multiobjective optimization framework based on non-dominated solutions. The proposed algorithm is applied to solve the multiobjective Optimal Power Flow problem in the IEEE 30-bus test system. The incorporation of the Newton-Raphson method ensures the physical feasibility of the solutions by satisfying equality constraints and maintaining system operability, while the SOS-based heuristic efficiently explores the search space to identify a diverse set of high-quality solutions. The resulting two- and three-dimensional Pareto fronts demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to effectively capture both diversity and optimality across the defined objectives. Additionally, the derived control variables remain within the prescribed operational limits, thus ensuring technical feasibility and system security. The algorithm presents fast convergence towards optimal trade-off solutions, which highlighting its effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation within complex multi-objective search spaces. Overall, the results validate the potential of the hybrid approach to deliver technically sound and energy-efficient solutions to nonlinear, multi-objective optimization problems in electric power systems."

This research proposes a noninvasive approach to early infection detection using daily seed temperature data via deep learning. Three architectures, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), and Latent Ordinary Differential Equation (Latent ODE) were comparatively evaluated. The dataset comprises daily temperature sequences (H0-H7;H=observation day since the experiment began) from three rice varieties: Ciherang, IR64, and Mekongga, labeled as infected or uninfected. The analysis focused on early detection scenarios with observation windows $\\mathbf{H 0 - H 3}$ (days $\\mathbf{0 - 3}$) and $\\mathbf{H 0}-$H4 (days $0-4$). Results show that the critical detection phase occurs at $\\mathbf{H 0}-\\mathbf{H 3}$, where Latent ODE achieved an accuracy of 0.98 with precision and recall above 0.97 across all classes. At $\\mathrm{H} 0-\\mathrm{H} 4$, performance reached perfection with 1.00 in accuracy, precision, and recall. These findings confirm the superiority of Latent ODE in modeling temporal dynamics from the early infection phase and demonstrate its potential as a reliable, rapid, and non-invasive detection system for Fusarium-infected rice seeds."

    "abstract": "Machine translation has advanced considerably in recent years yet producing accurate and natural translations remains challenging for languages with limited digital resources. The scarcity of high-quality parallel data particularly hampers the performance of models in low-resource languages. This study introduces a preference-based learning approach grounded in reinforcement learning principles to improve translation quality by incorporating human feedback during the fine-tuning of the multilingual mT5-Large model. Two optimization techniques are employed: Direct Preference Optimization, which aligns model outputs with human preferences through pairwise comparison, and Hypergeometric Gamma Reward, a novel method proposed in this work that generates reward signals based on semantic similarity scores computed using Sentence-BERT. These rewards are integrated into the translation model through reward-weighted loss optimization. The approach is evaluated on translations from Dogri, Kashmiri, and Konkani into English using two standard test sets, IN22-Gen and IN22-Conv. The enhanced model achieves BLEU scores of 49.81 and 57.21 for Dogri to English, 43.57 and 46.57 for Kashmiri to English, and 38.75 and 34.56 for Konkani to English on IN22-Gen and IN22-Conv, respectively. All reported improvements were validated through the Approximate Randomization Test and repeated-measures Analysis of Variance, both confirming that the observed gains are statistically significant. The statistical analysis further demonstrates that the combined Direct Preference Optimization and Hypergeometric Gamma Reward model consistently achieves the strongest improvements in both syntactic accuracy and semantic similarity across all datasets. Despite using significantly less training data than the state-of-the-art IndicTrans2 model, the proposed method delivers superior or comparable performance to transformer-based architectures and other large language models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating human feedback through the combined use of reinforcement learning-inspired preference learning and reward-based optimization, highlighting their potential to enhance translation quality for low-resource and underrepresented languages."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced significant innovations in healthcare, yet its adoption has been slower compared to other industries. A key barrier lies in concerns over trustworthiness, as healthcare stakeholders often express skepticism stemming from the opacity of AI systems, risks of privacy breaches, potential biases that exacerbate social inequities, and unresolved safety issues. Ensuring trustworthy AI is therefore essential for its safe, effective, and responsible integration into clinical practice. This integrative review examines four fundamental dimensions of trustworthy AI in healthcare: transparency and explainability, privacy and security, robustness and safety, and bias and fairness. Unlike prior surveys that either addressed trustworthiness in AI broadly or focused narrowly on traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), this work extends the discussion to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI, both of which are poised to play transformative roles in healthcare. We also explore the intersections among trustworthiness dimensions and highlight the often-overlooked roles of user trust and organizational accountability in shaping real-world adoption. Finally, we provide targeted recommendations, outlining practical tools, frameworks, and strategies tailored to different model classes to address concrete trustworthiness challenges in healthcare AI."

    "abstract": "Biomedicine datasets often contain noisy, imbalanced, and high-dimensional features, which makes the choice of neural network training strategy a decisive factor for clinical decision support. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied to medical diagnosis tasks, comparative analyses across a broad spectrum of training algorithms remain limited. This study addresses this gap by evaluating twelve distinct ANN training algorithms on sixteen publicly available biomedicine datasets. The performance of each method was assessed according to training duration, loss metrics, and classification accuracy. During the testing phase, essential metrics such as F-measure, G-mean, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision were evaluated. A Friedman test was performed to statistically verify the performance discrepancies among the algorithms. The findings indicated that the selection of the training algorithm significantly influences classification efficacy. The results reveal that Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularization consistently achieve high predictive performance on complex datasets, whereas the Variable Learning Rate method demonstrates robust and scalable performance across heterogeneous data conditions. Importantly, the findings indicate that no universal “best” algorithm exists; optimal selection depends on dataset characteristics such as size, dimensionality, and noise distribution. By mapping algorithm strengths and weaknesses across diverse diagnostic scenarios, this work provides actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to design reliable and efficient ANN-based decision support systems in healthcare. Compared to baseline gradient descent variants, advanced training algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularization achieved up to 25% higher accuracy (e.g., on the Skin_Nonskin dataset) and 20% higher F-measure (e.g., on the Saheart dataset) across multiple biomedicine datasets."

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are key biomarkers and therapeutic targets due to their role in regulating biological processes and disease progression. Traditional identification of miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) is costly and slow, motivating computational approaches. In this study, we propose HGNNMDA, a hybrid prediction model applying graph neural networks (GNNs) for predicting MDAs. The key novelty of HGNNMDA lies in its interactive dual-branch architecture, where each branch integrates both graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph attention networks (GATs) to extract robust features from diverse biological data sources. This design generates complementary feature representations by leveraging GCNs to capture structural associations through neighborhood aggregation, while employing GATs to prioritize the most relevant interactions via attention mechanisms, effectively overcoming limitations of single-architecture GNNs. The obtained feature vectors are then processed by XGBoosts to generate predictive scores, which are subsequently combined for final predictions. HGNNMDA outperforms seven recent methods in experimental validation on three datasets (HMDD v2.0, HMDD v3.2, and an independent dataset) and shows strong results in de novo validation and case studies.

    "abstract": "Sparse arrays offer a promising solution for reducing the data volume required to reconstruct ultrasound images, making them well-suited for portable and wireless devices. However, the quality of images beamformed from a limited number of transducer elements is significantly degraded. This study proposes a deep learning-based inpainting technique to estimate complete radio frequency (RF) signals (before beamforming) from downsampled RF signals obtained using a subset of transducer elements. This approach allows for quality enhancement without the need to beamform images, offering flexibility particularly beneficial for applications such as speed-of-sound estimation algorithms. We introduce a model-based loss function that combines the signal and image domains by incorporating a measurement model associated with image reconstruction. We then compare this loss with another that accounts solely for the RF signal domain. Additionally, we train our network exclusively in the RF image domain, mapping images beamformed from downsampled RF signals to those from complete signals. We compare these approaches qualitatively and quantitatively, with all enhancing image quality. The proposed method with the modelbased loss achieves superior detail and quality metrics. Although trained on downsampled RF signals simulating sparse arrays in reception, all methods-especially our inpainting approach with the model-based loss-demonstrate strong adaptability to ultrafast acquisitions with reduced transducer elements in both transmission and reception. This highlights their potential for reducing the number of transducer elements in ultrasound probes. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits superior generalization performance when evaluated on a different probe than the one used to acquire the training dataset."

    "abstract": "Satellite images have gained considerable traction for near-real-time and rapid flood mapping because they are agnostic to flooding mechanisms and their drivers, hence applicable to any floods, whether pluvial, fluvial, or both (i.e., compound flood). However, flood mapping using satellite images is challenging due to cloud cover and shadows, particularly in regions where floods typically occur during monsoon seasons with frequent and extensive cloud cover (e.g., South Asian countries). Generally, optical images (e.g., Landsat) are used alone or in combination with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (e.g., Sentinel-1) under the multisource flood mapping (MSFM) framework for rapid flood detection. However, clouds often affect optical images, limiting their ability to provide reliable flooding information. Additionally, the MSFM requires diligent (and often manual) identification of a pre-flood image, which may be challenging when automatically delineating multiple floods. Moreover, using a unique permanent water body for flood delineation may be erroneous for regions like northeastern Bangladesh, where the water extent climatology varies significantly for monsoon months (when floods usually occur). In contrast, this work presents a rapid, simple, and comparable thresholding algorithm for flood delineation using Sentinel-1 SAR images, where backscatter coefficient values are used to identify the watered pixels, and the flooded pixels are determined by comparing them with the monthly climatology of water extent. The method is applied to map the surface water and flood extents for catastrophic back-to-back flood events in the northeastern part of Bangladesh in 2022 caused by heavy local precipitation and upstream discharges (i.e., compound flood), leveraging the cloud based computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results (i.e., surface water and flood extent maps) are comparable to those obtained using the recently developed sophisticated MSFM and existing SAR-based methods. Besides, our thresholding algorithm provides reliable flood maps for instances where MSFM miscalculates flood extent due to significant cloud cover. The technique developed in this study will enable decision makers and emergency responders to obtain precise information rapidly during time-sensitive flooding events, supporting informed decision-making for resource allocation and rescue planning."

    "abstract": "Robotic automation in high-mix, low-volume settings often relies on structured workcells where fixtures, workpieces, and procedures are well defined, but tasks must be reconfigured quickly across variants. This paper presents the Design and Learning Research Group's solution to the euROBIN Manipulation Skill Versatility Challenge (MSVC) at IROS 2024, in which a standardized electronic task board is operated through a fixed sequence of subtasks. We deliberately adopt a simple, industry-style implementation: each subtask is taught by recording an open-loop Tool Center Point (TCP) and gripper trajectory in the task-board frame, a wrist-mounted depth camera is used once per run to localize the board and a few key features, and a web dashboard exposes the resulting motion primitives as reusable code blocks that can be reordered and reparameterized. With this pipeline, our system completes the benchmark in 28.2 s in the lab (37.2 s on-site), compared to a human baseline of 16.3 s and an average of 83.5 s for previous teams, closing a large part of the performance gap without advanced learning or feedback control. We further demonstrate limited skill transfer by retargeting the same subtask library to a smoke-detector battery replacement scenario required by the competition. Finally, we release our implementation as open source and discuss how competition design and benchmark structure influence the balance between simple engineered solutions and richer sensing and learning."

    "abstract": "For the pulsed power load (PPL) with low frequency, which requires single-phase ac input voltage, such as ground radar, its input power presents double-line-frequency fluctuation and output power is pulsed, resulting in high input current harmonic and ripple. To balance the instantaneous power difference, the required storage capacitor is usually large, which leads to an increase in the size of the converter. A two-stage single-phase ac–dc PPL converter is proposed in this article, with the high fluctuation over than the hundred volts of bus capacitor voltage, which greatly reduces the capacitance and size. The causes of input current distortion were derived from the harmonic transmission in detail, and the bus capacitor design process considering the phase shift between input and output power is given. To suppress the input current harmonic and ripple, a low input current harmonic control strategy is proposed by replacing the outer-voltage loop with the proportion of the average load current, and verified by an experimental prototype with 1 kW peak power. The results show that the proposed converter and control strategy have a good performance, obtaining the lowest total harmonic current distortion (THDi) of 2%, the efficiency is up to 92.9%, and the power factor (PF) remains above 0.99 with the pulse repetition frequency of 100–500 Hz."

The SRRMs were modified by connecting an interdigital capacitor with two pairs of fingers to the center of the resonator. Moreover, the opening in the ground plane of the sensor serves as a sensitive area because the discontinuity in the ground plane generates controllable radiation leakage with the size of the slit, allowing the analysis of various sections of a structure. The sensor uses two SRRMs with different maximum penetration depths to analyze the base of the container and the contents. Several design parameters affecting the maximum penetration depth were analyzed, including the slot width and the number of fingers on the interdigital capacitor. Subsequently, the SRRMs were designed to present resonance frequencies close to 1.78 GHz and 1.95 GHz and maximum penetration depths of 1.5 mm and 12.0 mm respectively. Various containers were manufactured and tested with different materials and base thickness. Moreover, non-uninform containers were analyzed with air bubbles and inclination.

    "abstract": "Over the years, researchers have proposed numerous Twin Support Vector Machines (TSVM) variants aimed at addressing diverse challenges. These variants encompass sparse TSVM models, robust TSVM models as well as those designed to exhibit noise resilience through the modification of loss functions, among other enhancements. However, there is a lack of an approach that can address multiple problems comprehensively. This motivates us to introduce a modular TSVM framework capable of addressing many challenges in a unified sense. Through this paper, we propose Unified-TSVM (Uni-TSVM), which enables efficient handling of any convex as well as non-convex, Least Squares type Difference of Convex (LS-DC) loss functions. We expand the list of LS-DC loss functions by adding a noise-resilient loss and introduce a versatile trick capable of bounding any loss function. The unified framework leverages low-rank property to introduce sparsity into Unified-TSVM, thus accelerating computation for large-scale applications. Moreover, by utilising matrix calculations, the Unified-TSVM framework facilitates explicit classification across binary, multiclass, and multilabel domains while also enhancing computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a thresholding mechanism to avoid training the second hyperplane, further reducing computational complexity. Experiments on many large binary, multiclass and multilabel datasets, with and without noise, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication is increasingly recognized as a promising paradigm for enhancing the communication capabilities of wireless systems in the 6G era. Existing deep learning (DL)-based semantic methods typically enhance system robustness through module-centric strategies, where additional components are integrated into the model. Due to the significant computational overhead, these strategies are often unsuitable for resource-limited systems, such as the emerging low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs). Moreover, most existing methods are optimized for fixed channel models and lack architectural adaptability across diverse environments, leading to repeated retraining and increased maintenance complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Branch Architecture (DBA) for semantic communication. DBA employs a training-only auxiliary decoder branch to provide noise-free supervision for the main decoder, thereby enhancing robustness without adding deployment or inference overhead. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning mechanism to align the outputs of the noisy and noise-free branches, reinforcing semantic consistency. Building on this, we further propose the Extensible Multi-Channel Architecture (EMCA), a multi-branch design that incorporates multiple decoder branches optimized for different channel models and jointly trains them with a shared encoder and auxiliary branch, improving scalability without duplicating model parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that DBA and EMCA consistently outperform existing baselines in terms of semantic fidelity across additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh, and Rician fading channels, without incurring any additional inference cost. Additionally, experiments conducted using a software-defined radio (SDR)-based platform with universal software radio peripheral (USRP) further validate the robustness and practicality of the proposed methods in practical environmental applications."

    "abstract": "Autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles require accurate perception of their surrounding environment to ensure safe operation, yet onboard sensors frequently encounter occlusion challenges that result in incomplete dynamic environmental maps. Infrastructure-to-vehicle cooperative perception addresses this by deploying infrastructure nodes that monitor scenes and share reliable environmental maps with nearby vehicles via technologies like C-V2X. However, existing infrastructure perspective datasets lack diverse multi-modal data and aerial footage, which are crucial to determine effectively the necessary sensors for safety-critical infrastructure node applications. This paper introduces G-MIND, a multimodal infrastructure node dataset supporting research into sensor suitability for infrastructure-assisted safety-critical applications. G-MIND is the first dataset to incorporate this comprehensive range of sensing modalities for infrastructure-based perception: RGB, FIR, and neuromorphic cameras, LiDARs, RADAR, and aerial drone footage. With 91,500 annotated frames, G-MIND offers a larger scale than existing infrastructure perception datasets such as Ko-PER (10k frames), CoopScenes (40K frames), and DAIR-V2X (71k frames), enabling more comprehensive training and evaluation. The dataset captures day and night scenarios featuring cars, pedestrians, and cyclists across diverse traffic scenarios. Beyond standard perception benchmarking, G-MIND includes specialized collections designed to test perception system boundaries: maximum detection distance scenarios, far and occluded object scenarios, and pedestrian action prediction scenarios that challenge current algorithms. Additionally, this paper analyzes what constitutes effective ITS infrastructure node sensors from a practical perspective, comparing modalities against technical criteria (field of view, spatial resolution, low light performance, adverse weather resilience) and pragmatic criteria (cost, durability).

In this context, this work proposes a new approach to dynamic lighting control that combines two key parameters: maintaining a melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (mEDI) of approximately 250 lx at eye level (1.2 m, seated position) and controlling the color temperature (CCT) in predefined time windows between 07:00 and 17:00. The system uses sensors to measure spectral characteristics and intensity, integrated into an IoT-based architecture. This ensures not only visual comfort but also biologically effective light exposure, consistent with medical evidence for morning stimulation and subsequent neutrality during the day. This work offers an integrated consideration of mEDI and CCT time profiles as a method for creating a favorable and healthy learning environment that follows the body's circadian rhythm."

This process depends on numerical methods since analytical equations are often limited due to the complex properties of tissues. In this paper, the method of moments (MoM) is employed to solve the electric potential distribution within muscle tissue modeled as an isotropic and dispersive medium excited by a point current source placed at the surface. For verification, the numerically calculated results are compared with analytically obtained values for an identical representative system."

    "abstract": "In recent years, technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning, have enabled the automation of tasks once thought impractical. However, many public sector organizations continue to rely on manual processes, especially in areas like vehicle fleet management, where critical operational data remains underutilized. This study addresses that gap by proposing a machine learning model aimed at improving vehicle fleet management in public enterprises. The model focuses on classifying drivers based on their risk levels, leveraging behavioral data, individual driver characteristics, and patterns of vehicle usage to provide actionable recommendations for fleet optimization. A key innovation of this work is the integration of web scraping techniques to automatically collect and update data related to drivers, vehicles, and fleet operations. This significantly reduces the dependency on manual data entry and supports the automation of processes such as vehicle registration validity control. The proposed system also includes the development of driver risk classification models, with results visualized through an interactive dashboard and geospatial map to facilitate strategic decision-making. This approach enhances the efficiency, transparency, and data-driven decision-making capabilities of public entities managing transportation assets."

A total of 4,432 student surveys containing 12 questions with five-point Likert-type scales are analyzed. Based on nine behavioral indicators, the responses are classified into six categories: regular responding, three types of inattentiveness (midpoint responding, straight-lining, random responding), and two extreme response styles (negative and positive). For classification, Random Forest and XGBoost are applied, evaluated by stratified k-fold cross-validation and balanced with SMOTE. The results indicate high effectiveness of both models, with balanced accuracy exceeding 0.93. Regular responding and extreme response styles are distinguished with the highest accuracy, the inattentive categories also showed reliable classification performance. The methodology demonstrates the potential of machine learning as a tool for improving survey data quality and can be adapted to diverse research contexts."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of e-commerce in Indonesia has made it difficult for consumers to determine which products are worth purchasing. To address this issue, a real-time sentiment analysis system based on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) was developed to extract consumer opinions based on product aspects. This system focuses on clothing product reviews with three main aspects: material, stitching, and product conformity, which are considered essential in consumer decision-making. The IndoBERTweet model is used for aspect-based sentiment analysis, achieving an F1-score of 0.88, demonstrating good performance in understanding informal and context-specific language frequently found in online reviews. Furthermore, the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method is employed to calculate product recommendation scores based on the combination of aspect weights and normalized differences between positive and negative reviews. The system was designed to operate automatically starting from review crawling, pre-processing, sentiment classification, scoring, up to visualization of ranked product results. The implementation results show that the system is capable of performing sentiment-based reasoning and providing transparent recommendations, thus assisting consumers in making better and more confident purchasing decisions on e-commerce platforms."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end freespace optical (FSO) transmission framework that employs a filtered-OFDM (F-OFDM) transceiver for $\\mathbf{5 G}$ optical wireless backhaul and access. The architecture integrates an optical fiber front haul with an IM/DD FSO link and models the dominant impairments: atmospheric turbulence, pointing-induced misalignment, geometric divergence, front-end nonlinearities, and cochannel interference under multichannel operation. A composite statistical channel is formulated by coupling turbulence, pointing error, and geometric coupling into the received irradiance, from which closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, outage probability, and error performance are obtained. The transmitter leverages subband filtering to suppress out-of-band leakage and reduce peak-to-average power ratio, thereby improving nonlinear tolerance. The framework is validated through coordinated Op-tiSystem-MATLAB co-simulation with forward error correction, QPSK/16-QAM mapping, and FFT-based baseband processing. Performance is evaluated using bit error rate, PAPR complementary CDF, divergence loss, error vector magnitude, and outage as a function of SNR threshold across wavelengths, transmit powers, apertures, and ranges. Compared with conventional OFDM and UFMC under identical link budgets, the proposed transceiver consistently exhibits lower PAPR at fixed exceedance probability, reduced BER at practical transmit powers and ranges, and lower outage under degraded visibility, demonstrating improved robustness to turbulence/misalignment and mitigated divergence penalties for high-capacity 5G optical wireless links."

This leads to poorer performance on under-represented groups. We aim to explore the effectiveness of few-shot learning approaches to address this cross-domain problem. Four metric-based FSL meta-learners Prototypical, Matching, Siamese and Relation Networks sharing an EfficientNet-V2-S backbone are trained episodically on HAM10000, then compared with a conventional supervised baseline classifier across five domains. After selecting the best FSL model, we test it on the DDI dataset and compare its performance with benchmark metrics from the original study. Unlike prior studies, evaluation also uses imbalance-aware metrics (AUC-PR, F1, precision, and recall) instead of accuracy or AUC-ROC alone. In crossdomain evaluations on both HAM10000 and DDI datasets, the FSL models consistently outperform the conventionally trained benchmark. The Prototypical Network especially demonstrated superior balanced performance compared to all other FSL models. Performance also improved with higher shot counts, yielding more stable results across domains. Our findings suggest that FSL methods particularly those making use of holistic prototype approaches provide a more promising foundation for developing models for cross-domain tasks than the conventional supervised learning method."

    "abstract": "Surgical procedures can be decomposed into elementary units (tasks, surgemes, and dexemes) that represent the building blocks of surgical performance. Segmenting gestures at this level is crucial for objective skill assessment and for understanding how simple movements are concatenated to form complete procedures, ultimately supporting the development of training and evaluation systems. In this work, we present a pseudo-temporal modeling approach for surgical gesture segmentation using a 2D ResNet-50 convolutional network trained exclusively on RGB frames. During training, each video was divided into eight equal segments, which were used to feed the network and generate gesture-level probabilities. To optimize learning, an adaptive Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism was applied to stabilize weight updates and reinforce poorly performing gesture classes. At inference, complete surgical videos were processed with an overlapping sliding window of eight frames, where each frame could be evaluated multiple times in different contexts. Frame-level probabilities were averaged across overlapping windows and refined through a temporal mode filter, producing stable and coherent gesture sequences. The method was validated on the JIGSAWS dataset, which includes the Suturing, Knot Tying, and Needle Passing tasks. Results showed reliable recognition across all procedures: Suturing achieved 82.26%, Knot Tying 91.97%, and Needle Passing 79.35%. Training required approximately one hour, and inference on a complete video of 2950 frames was performed in about 45 seconds, also generating a labeled output video. By relying solely on 2D convolutions and RGB input, the approach achieves accurate and efficient segmentation with low computational cost, making it suitable for surgical training environments with limited resources and applicable in near real-time scenarios."

This study aims to enhance the user experience of the news portal by employing the User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology and Heuristic Evaluation. The main issues identified include unintuitive navigation, non-responsive design, and suboptimal user experience. The research methodology combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data collection was conducted using the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and the System Usability Scale (SUS) during the pre- and post-redesign stages. Heuristic evaluation by experts and user interviews complemented the analysis to identify user pain points and needs. A new design prototype was developed using the Figma application and tested through design iterations involving user feedback. The results showed a significant improvement in user experience. The SUS score increased from 60.75 (Grade D) to 89.25 (Grade B), while UEQ revealed enhancements in both pragmatic quality and hedonic quality. The novelty of this research lies in the comprehensive application of UCD and heuristic evaluation to create a responsive, intuitive, and user-centered interface. This study contributes to the development of mobile-based news portal designs in Indonesia, with practical implications for improving user satisfaction, loyalty, and competitiveness in digital news portals."

    "abstract": "In uplink 5G and beyond networks, efficient resource allocation is critical to meeting diverse service demands while reducing energy consumption. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle to handle the high complexity and dynamic nature of resource block (RB) and power allocation in multi-user uplink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems. This paper proposes a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based framework to optimize joint RB and discrete power allocation for uplink users. The objective is to maximize the minimum energy efficiency (EE) among all users, ensuring fairness and compliance with per-user power budget constraints. The proposed approach models the allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn policies without requiring explicit channel statistics. Simulation results demonstrate that the DQN agent outperforms the baseline while maintaining user Quality of Service (QoS). DQN with constant-time inference yields practical energy savings at the base station, enabling sustained, real-time EE improvements under realistic scheduling budgets."

DINOv2 embeddings visualization using PCA depicts Bromus Sterilis L. as a vertically elongated cluster, while the other plant embeddings are forming a tight cluster. Conversely, in UMAP visualization, the plant embeddings are more wellseparated, with a higher silhouette score, lower Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), and higher Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) compared to PCA (silhouette score 0.4401 vs 0.0905; DBI 2.9388 vs 3.8379; CHI 7910.6325 vs 3640.4362).

    "abstract": "Realizing that technology keeps changing every day must be terrifying for organizations that want to stay afloat. In the midst of digital transformation, there is one concept standing tall that offers assistance for companies to adapt by creating an Enterprise Architecture (EA). EA is a concept that bridges gaps between business and technology that ensures alignment. One of the main problems during EA drawing is redundancy. When the $\\mathbf{E A}$ drawing contains redundancies, it fosters a flawed design destined for poor decision-making. To avoid facing such problems, this research proposes using a model that combines similarity analysis and clustering to help identify relations and its components’ similarities. By using ArchiMate notation relations and its metadata, this study intends to develop a similarity-based algorithm for consolidation recommendation. This research found that using cosine similarity and spectral clustering generated adequate quality clusters with a Silhouette Score of 0.736, a DaviesBouldin Index of 1.061, and an Average Similarity Score of 0.881. Not only that, these combined models managed to reduce $63.28 \\%$ of the total initial redundancy. In the end, this study highlights that information system consolidation can be based on cosine similarity and spectral clustering techniques, with notes to explore other similarity analysis metrics for comparison and for practitioners to verify the results."

    "abstract": "For inertial measurement unit (IMU)/ ultra- wideband (UWB) integrated navigation systems, constructing the dynamics model based on additive errors is a common approach. However, the dependence of the error dynamics on the estimated navigation and bias states requires accurate initial state estimation, which may limit system application. To mitigate this limitation, several geometric navigation approaches have been proposed to decouple error dynamics from state estimation by introducing nonlinear error definitions. In this study, we firstly apply several nonlinear error representations, including two-frame group left- and right-invariant errors as well as tangent group errors to IMU/UWB integrated navigation to develop multiple distinct schemes. Furthermore, a novel left-invariant nonlinear error definition is proposed, wherein the error evolution of the navigation state achieves independent of navigation and bias estimation. The associated error dynamics and the integration scheme for the IMU/UWB-based navigation system are derived. The proposed methods are validated by using simulation data and a public dataset, demonstrating improved accuracy and reliability compared with the state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "The precise configuration of the axial ratio bandwidth is usually hindered by the structural limitations of linear-to-circular polarization (LP-to-CP) conversion. To overcome this challenge, this article proposes a synthesis method for an LP-to-CP converter based on the filter coupling matrix theory. This method can calculate the topological parameters for arbitrary AR bandwidths using the coupling matrix with a self-coupling offset. Consequently, the design of a converter in accordance with these topological parameters facilitates the realization of the corresponding AR bandwidth. To validate the proposed synthesis design, an LP-to-CP converter based on a fourth-order Chebyshev topology was designed, which can achieve different axial ratio bandwidths. The designed polarization converter is a planar structure consisting of a multilayer dielectric substrate. To obtain radiation beam control capabilities, an LP-to-CP converter with 1-bit phase modulation can be achieved by changing the coupling characteristics in the topology. The designed LP-to-CP converter, when combined with a horn antenna to form a transmitarray, is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the fabricated transmitarray based on the designed LP-to-CP converter achieves an AR bandwidth of 23.7–28 GHz and maximum gains of 21.66 dBic under RHCP radiation characteristics. The experimental results are in agreement with the synthesis results and the simulated results."

However, the heterogeneity of devices (e.g., varying computational capacity, stability, security requirements) can impact the performance of DFL applications. Our proposed SSAA, a secure aggregation scheme for DFL on heterogeneous devices, presented in this paper is designed to improve the efficiency of DFL while preserving privacy. Specifically, SSAA accelerates aggregation by synchronously coupling aggregation device-set formation with aggregation computation, and can cope with device availability and performance variability to maintain stable and efficient aggregation. By extending homomorphic encryption to support cross-round ciphertext continuity, SSAA enables reliable and secure decryption under large-scale dropouts in the original aggregation set, making it practical for dynamic DFL environments. In addition, we prove that SSAA is semi-honestly secure and resistant to device collusion attacks – fundamental security requirements for applications involving heterogeneous devices. We also implement SSAA and comprehensively evaluate its performance to demonstrate its practicability."

    "abstract": "Ocean exploration using acoustical 3-D imaging is gaining popularity as it provides information about the 3-D geometry of the targets even under mild turbid conditions. A major challenge in underwater 3-D imaging is the high cost of the planar arrays and the computational complexity of the image reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we introduce the use of a uniform rectangle array placed at the edges of a uniform planar array for underwater 3-D imaging. During reconstruction, an orthogonal combination of two linear arrays which forms an L-shape is used to perform two independent and parallel 2-D delay and sum beamforming and the 3-D image is reconstructed using the product of the resulting beams. Each quadrant in the imaging slice is reconstructed in parallel using different L-shaped arrays. This quadrant-based time domain receive beamforming focuses on achieving relatively low computational complexity for real-time 3-D imaging in underwater environments. The proposed method with 47 hydrophones has reduced the main lobe width by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{2}^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> with 6 dB increase in the peak side lobe level when compared to the conventional delay and sum beamforming using a uniform planar array of 576 elements. Although there is an increase in the side lobe level, the asymmetric beam pattern of the proposed L array and the quadrant-based beamforming restrict the side lobes within a quadrant. The proposed method achieves a reduction in computation time by a factor of 97 for 3-D imaging compared to the conventional method, while maintaining acceptable image quality. For qualitative analysis, the 3-D images of different underwater targets have been reconstructed and compared in simulation and experiment."

In contrast to point-to-point protocols, end-to-end secure quantum communication is particularly promising for large-scale quantum networks. Here, we propose a scheme for end-to-end secure communication with private message authentication. For practical purposes, we demonstrate the scheme in a quantum communication network with optical fibers or free-space links that integrate secure repeaters. Furthermore, we present a route proposal model for routing private messages in a quantum network based on the scheme. As messages are routed through a network, malicious nodes may tamper with the messages passing through them with some probability. Based on authentication results, we use machine learning methods to detect malicious nodes, including supervised and unsupervised algorithms. The simulation results in specific networks show that our methods can effectively detect malicious nodes under different tamper probabilities."

Tensor-based probabilistic graph methods address interpretability and stability concerns encountered in neural network approaches and allow tractable inference (e.g., marginal inference and conditional inference). In this paper, we introduce tensor ring decomposition for density estimation, which reduces the number of permutation candidates compared to existing methods, while simultaneously enhancing expressive power and maintaining tractable inference. Different non-negative strategies for density function results in two variants: Born TRDE offers simpler inference and sampling but with slightly lower accuracy, while Energy TRDE, though more complex, achieves superior performance. Furthermore, a mixture model that incorporates multiple permutation candidates with adaptive weights is designed, resulting in increased expressive flexibility and comprehensiveness. Unlike existing methods that focus on finding a single optimal permutation, our approach, inspired by ensemble learning, demonstrates that combining multiple suboptimal permutations can yield superior results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach excels in estimating probability density functions and sampling, capturing intricate details with competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) tractable density methods."

A single optical frequency comb can be used for both data modulation and distributed local oscillators. This comb-assisted architecture can be combined with integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) and silicon photonic traveling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators (TW-MZMs). We analyze two configurations for this combination, placing the SOAs either before or after the modulators. Our results show that positioning SOAs after the modulators enhances overall power efficiency, while longer (4 mm) modulators provide superior power handling due to lower total loss while providing a sufficient bandwidth. Furthermore, by adjusting the power-splitting ratio between the data carrier and the distributed local oscillator, the minimum achievable bit error rate (BER) can be tuned in the post-modulation SOA configuration. These findings offer design insights for optimizing coherent multi-wavelength transceivers based on silicon photonics for next-generation intra-datacenter links."

    "abstract": "An original method based on the radar bistatic technique (RBTech) is proposed to characterize key antenna parameters, with emphasis on radiation patterns. The bistatic configuration comprises two standard transmit/receive antennas, and the antenna under test. While the transmitting Tx antenna remains fixed, in front of the target (at normal incidence), the receiving Rx antenna rotates around with a bistatic angle. Rx measures the diffracted wave (i.e. backscattered field) as a function of the frequency, the wave polarization and the bistatic angle, for different terminal impedance; namely short-circuit, open circuit, and matched load. First, the antenna mode corresponding to the reradiated wave is recovered in the time domain by removing the structural mode. The structural mode is obtained by measuring the backscattered wave when the antenna is well matched, i.e., with a near-zero reflection coefficient. Second, time-gating and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processing are applied to extract the frequency spectrum of the recovered reradiated waves from the time-domain antenna-mode signal. By compiling these results as a function of the bistatic angle, the radiation pattern can be reconstructed in any cut-plane for both co-and cross-polarizations. Experimental measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber, based on an accurate wideband calibration procedure, along with full-wave simulations using the radar bistatic technique, were performed on a triband omnidirectional antenna and patch arrays. Very good agreement was observed between the reconstructed patterns and those obtained via conventional simulation and measurement methods. The developed radar bistatic technique demonstrates accuracy, potential for non-invasive operation, and remote applicability."

    "abstract": "A dual-band linear-to-circular polarization converter is presented for Ka-band mobile satellite communication antennas operating under variable incidence. The converter operates in transmission mode, providing left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) at 20 GHz for signal reception and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) at 30 GHz for signal transmission (or vice versa with a mechanical rotation of 90∘). The polarizer consists of three anisotropic metasurfaces separated by two identical dielectric layers, with low-loss impedance transformers on both sides to improve matching and maintain stable performance up to 60∘ incidence. The total thickness of the structure is 8.4 mm. Each metasurface unit cell integrates two distinct metallic inclusions: an electric-LC (ELC) split-ring resonator (SRR) and a meander-line element. The meander-line elements are oriented at 45∘ with respect to the incident linearly polarized electric field. The proposed methodology focuses on optimizing unit cells for oblique incidence, where mode coupling must be considered. The design targets angle-stable susceptances that enable linear-to-circular polarization conversion over two wide frequency bands. Prototypes are fabricated and experimentally characterized through S-parameter measurements over the 18–32 GHz frequency range. Measurement results exhibit excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. The polarizer achieves near-unity transmittance, high polarization conversion efficiency, insertion loss below 2 dB, and an axial ratio below 3 dB over bandwidths exceeding 2 GHz–namely, 19–21 GHz and 29–31 GHz. Furthermore, the structure maintains robust angular stability for incidence angles ranging from 0∘ to 60∘. These results demonstrate the designs suitability for a broad range of commercial and military applications."

    "abstract": "The evolution from fifth-generation (5G) networks to sixth-generation (6G) networks demands ultra-high data rates, low latency, and robust connectivity. Terahertz (THz) band offers broad bandwidth but suffers from severe path loss and high blockage sensitivity, making non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links challenging. While large antenna arrays mitigate attenuation, performance still depends on environmental surface interactions. In this context, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple output (XL-MIMO) systems provide a unique advantage by offering enhanced angular resolution for better characterization of surface interactions. Building on these insights, we propose a visibility region (VR)-based framework for surface identification in near field (NF) THz XL-MIMO systems. By incorporating surface scattering characteristics into VR modeling, we derive power-angle profiles (PAPs) that serve as unique signatures to distinguish smooth, medium, and rough surfaces based on their scattering power behavior and angular spread. Our analysis of VR power across antenna indices highlights how both proximity and surface characteristics affect the ability to identify surfaces. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated through root mean square error, and probability of detection analyses, with results compared against a conventional scattering-agnostic NF channel. The proposed method also achieves significantly reduced computational complexity, enabling real-time execution while maintaining high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, a Gaussian filter is applied to reduce diffuse scattering fluctuations, making the angular broadening from surfaces more obvious. In addition, capacity analysis is performed under single-and multi-surface scenarios, revealing trade-offs between path loss reduction at close distances and multipath richness due to multiple surfaces. The capacity analysis further demonstrate that the scattering-aware framework achieves higher overall throughput and approaches the analytical upper bound. The results confirm the practicality of the proposed approach and highlight surface characteristics as a critical design parameter for establishing robust NLoS connectivity in NF THz XL-MIMO while maintaining lower complexity."

To address this issue, this work presents a nonlinear control strategy based on a classical PID structure enhanced with a variable gain that depends on the tracking error. The gain increases when the error is large to improve transient response and decreases near the reference to reduce control effort, reverting to a linear PID behavior in steady state. The control law is formulated using inverse kinematics and evaluated through numerical simulation under an inclined square trajectory with abrupt changes and external disturbances, alongside a conventional linear PID for comparison. Performance is assessed using the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Squared Error (ISE), and the Total Variation of the control signal (TVu). The results show that the proposed controller reduces IAE and ISE by approximately $50 \\%$ compared to the linear PID, while maintaining acceptable levels of control effort, thus demonstrating the benefits of introducing a nonlinear gain to improve responsiveness and accuracy in PID-based structures."

    "abstract": "This work presents the implementation of a cascade control scheme for trajectory tracking of a mobile robot with an unknown dynamic model. The outer control loop is responsible for trajectory tracking, while the inner loop regulates the system velocity to compensate for the inherent nonlinearities of the dynamics. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is compared against a conventional PID controller, which also operates without requiring a system model. The robustness of the control approach is evaluated by subjecting the system to model perturbations, yielding an ISE of 1.073 and an ISCO of 106.75 for the PI controller, whereas the iPI achieved a lower ISE of 0.81 and an ISCO of $\\mathbf{1 0 0. 3 1}$. These results demonstrate that the modelfree controller exhibits superior performance in both trajectorytracking accuracy and disturbance rejection. Simulation tests were conducted using a dynamic model of the Pioneer 3-AT mobile robot, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy."

Instead, I hypothesize XAI can become more effective if treated as a type of education that can be used for educating users about AI’s decision-making processes. To explore this overall hypothesis, I plan to-1) conduct a literature review of educational theories and practices that can be applied for modifying an existing XAI system, 2) propose a set of hypotheses for testing the effectiveness of education-driven design changes in improving XAI, 3) apply educational theories and practices to modify an existing XAI system outside the education domain, and 4) conduct iterative qualitative evaluation with users and education specialists and then a quantitative lab study for testing the hypotheses to prove that education-driven design changes can improve XAI."

This study aims to evaluate user satisfaction levels with different urban transport cooperatives through a data-driven approach. A total of 123 responses were collected via a digitally distributed survey using QR codes, with a methodological focus on individuals aged 20 to 40 due to their higher digital literacy. The questionnaire included dimensions such as comfort and safety, risk perception, and punctuality. The analysis, conducted through Power BI, revealed differentiated levels of satisfaction across service dimensions. Comfort and safety received a mean rating of $41.5 \\%$, while risk perception reached $53.8 \\%$. Punctuality, evaluated through a single item, showed a favorable perception from $66.7 \\%$ of users. These findings indicate specific areas of concern, such as perceptions of security and cleanliness, which require attention from transport providers and local authorities. The results provide a scalable model for user satisfaction assessment that can be replicated in other urban contexts. Moreover, the integration of business intelligence tools facilitates evidencebased decision-making and supports future initiatives to enhance urban mobility systems in Ecuador and Latin America."

Based on a well-known textbook, that describes the factors influencing transient stability with a single-machine infinite-bus example, these examples were developed to show similar influences in an academic reduced model of the Spanish national grid. From the base case, taken as a reference for the comparisons, eight examples show the influence of the following factors on the results: a) fault clearing time; b) fault location; c) unit specified active power; d) unit excitation; e) unit inertia; f) grid voltage; g) selectivity of protections. This latter topic is included since it is explicitly mentioned in the master subject at UC3M (it is only implicit in the book explanations). The inclusion of other factors, such as generator reactance and fault type, was not considerable suitable from the perspective of the trade-off among complexity, effort and possible learning, in the particular case of the master subject at UC3M. However, the type of analyzed cases can be easily applied to another relatively complex grid taken as an example, since the concepts are general, and other factors can be properly and easily included in the analysis."

Traditional water systems often rely on unstable municipal supply and electrically powered pumping, increasing operational vulnerability. This paper presents the design and technical assessment of an integrated Rainwater Harvesting System (SCALL) powered by a standalone photovoltaic energy source for sanitary use in a higher education institution in Ambato, Ecuador. The system collects and stores rainwater via rooftop surfaces and distributes it using a 1 HP centrifugal pump coupled with a 60 liter hydropneumatic tank. Energy demands were met with three 580 Wp solar panels and a battery backup system delivering 7.46 kWh daily. Hydraulic simulations confirmed the system’s ability to cover $129.6 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ of annual demand, exceeding it with a capture potential of $166.65 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$-achieving a water savings rate of $112 \\%$. The design complies with NEC standards and integrates CONAGUA and SAAP methodologies for hydraulic and energy efficiency. With a total implementation cost of ${\\$}$ 4,294.79, the system demonstrates technical feasibility, resilience, and potential for replication in decentralized infrastructure.

Malware attacks on Android are increasing daily at a considerable volume, making Android users more vulnerable to cyberattacks. In response to this growing threat, researchers have developed numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect and mitigate these attacks. However, technological advances have led to an increase in the number of Android mobile devices, which are geographically dispersed, resulting in a distribution of data. This paper proposes an Android malware classification system based on federated learning (FL). To test our approach, we used four key datasets: Drebin, MalGenome, TUANDROMD and Kronodroid.We developed a neural network with a federated architecture and evaluated different algorithms, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network 1D (CNN Conv1D). The best-performing model is CNN Conv1D, achieving a precision of 97.62% and a recall of 98.15%. our federated approach maintains an optimal balance, effectively reducing false alarms while maximizing threat detection. The comparison of our approach with traditional centralized machine learning architecture reveals that it offers an optimal compromise between security, confidentiality and performance.This approach demonstrates that institutions can collaboratively train high-performance models on diverse and large-scale Android malware datasets without compromising user privacy. It brings key innovations, including a hybrid static and dynamic analysis, a comparative evaluation of multiple FL-compatible architectures, a contrastive study with centralized learning, and a real-world mobile deployment for on-device threat detection."

This study investigates the impact of hyperparameter tuning on deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs) for generating synthetic retinal fundus images to support eye disease classification (normal, cataract, glaucoma). We focus on two key research problems: determining suitable hyperparameter configurations for stable training, and assessing whether full-dataset training or class-specific training yields more representative synthetic images. Using Optuna for hyperparameter optimization, the DCGAN model was evaluated with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS). Results show that class-specific training better captures disease-relevant characteristics, while full-dataset training provides more balanced generalization. However, relatively high FID scores and low IS values highlight limitations in image sharpness and diversity, indicating the need for more advanced GAN architectures and larger datasets. This study contributes to the understanding of hyperparameter sensitivity in medical image synthesis and underscores the importance of generalizable approaches for real-world clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the important causes of cancer-related mortality globally, with most cases arising from undetected or misdiagnosed colorectal polyps. Accurate and timely segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is crucial for early detection and effective treatment. However, manual identification is challenging due to variations in polyp size, shape, color, and texture, as well as their resemblance to surrounding mucosa. To address these limitations, we propose DA-RDU-Net, a deep learning architecture that integrates a Double U-Net structure with Dual Attention mechanisms and Residual learning. The model incorporates both spatial and channel attention gates to highlight salient features, while residual blocks enhance gradient stability and feature propagation. Unlike conventional encoder–decoder networks, DA-RDU-Net adopts a two-stage segmentation strategy, where an initial prediction is refined through a second U-Net, improving boundary localization and contextual feature learning. We estimate the model on two benchmark datasets, CVC-ClinicDB, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrating its superior performance. DA-RDU-Net achieves state-of-the-art results, including a Dice coefficient of 0.9398 and mean IoU of 0.8864 on CVC-ClinicDB, with consistently high accuracy across other datasets. Comprehensive evaluation of Dice, IoU, Precision, and Recall confirms its robustness and strong generalization across diverse polyp morphologies and imaging conditions. These results highlight DA-RDU-Net as a highly effective and reliable framework for automated polyp segmentation, with strong potential for deployment in real-time clinical settings to support early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes."

Versions V1 and V2 were created without a comprehensive anatomical and biomechanical analysis of the ankle joint, which led to structural limitations, reduced comfort, and incomplete functional validation. A comparative review of these prototypes highlights the importance of considering joint anatomy, range of motion, and gait biomechanics at the early design stage. The study emphasizes that the absence of such analysis results in devices that are not fully adaptable to human anatomy and are less effective in rehabilitation scenarios. The findings suggest that integrating anatomical and biomechanical data into the design workflow, along with sensor-based feedback and adaptive control, is essential for achieving clinically viable ankle exoskeletons."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in modifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely studied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although “prompting” serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate intents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification introduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that natural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches have been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study investigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification: Direct Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in free-form language, and SummaryMediated Prompting, where changes are made by editing the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study with 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques across multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an iterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating outputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy presented tradeoffs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier to specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt scaffolding, and control. Developers’ choice of strategy was shaped by task goals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and code familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt interactions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summarycode traceability, and consistency in generated summaries."

Conventional practices often rely on generalized recommendations that neglect site-specific soil conditions, causing nutrient imbalances and inefficiencies. This study develops an intelligent fertilizer recommendation system that combines the Fuzzy Sugeno inference model with a Geographic Information System (GIS) for precision mapping. Soil macronutrients—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)—are used to generate optimized recommendations for urea, SP-36, and KCl. Calibration achieved high accuracy, with NPK sensor errors of 4.97% (phosphorus) and 3.39% (potassium), and GPS accuracy of 3.25 cm, while land area measurements showed negligible deviations. Field validation in rice and maize plots confirmed the effectiveness of site-specific recommendations, such as 34 kg urea, 17 kg SP-36, and 8.5 kg KCl for 0.17 ha of rice, and 18 kg urea, $9 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{SP}-36$, and 9 kg KCl for 0.09 ha of maize. WebGIS mapped 180 sampling points, calculated land area and perimeter, and produced spatial fertilization guidelines. The integration of real-time NPK sensor calibration with GIS-based fuzzy inference enables adaptive and crop-specific recommendations, offering a precise alternative to conventional methods. These results demonstrate the system’s readiness to support data-driven precision fertilization."

When including the ratios of deflection wave peaks in our feature set, accuracies of up to 89% and AUC of 0.95 were achieved. Our feature plot illustrates clear clustering between younger and older volunteers, specifically when using the peak ratios, confirming its discriminatory power and its significant potential as a non-invasive index for assessing vascular age.

These include:•Increase clinker substitution.•Reduce the use of fossil fuel and increase the adoption of alternative fuel.•Improve the efficiency in cement production.•Invest in technology and innovation.Cement companies have already started investing to reduce process carbon emission through new technology and among the most suitable to curb carbon emissions Waste Heat Recovery has been gathering momentum. In fact, cement is one of the manufacturing processes with higher potential for heat recovery as up to 40-45% of the heat produced is released as exhaust gases from preheater and clinker cooler.The fitting technologies for waste heat recovery in the cement sector are either steam Rankine Cycle, or Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). This paper will concentrate in describing Organic Rankine Cycle Waste Heat Recovery technology for cement sector outlining its advantages over a steam system in specific conditions and detailing with some business cases the economics and the environmental benefits deriving from installing a WHR systems."

    "abstract": "Current autonomous driving systems rely heavily on V2X communication data to enhance situational awareness and cooperation between vehicles. However, leveraging V2X data presents significant challenges due to communication impairments, primarily caused by delays and data loss in the wireless transmission channel. These impairments lead to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">impaired observability</i>, which must be carefully addressed when designing driving systems that rely on V2X data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Blind Actor-Critic</i> algorithm that ensures robust driving performance in V2X environments, even under conditions of delayed and/or lost data. The algorithm introduces three key innovations: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(i)</i> a virtual fixed sampling period, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(ii)</i> a hybrid approach combining <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Temporal-Difference</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Monte Carlo</i> learning, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(iii)</i> a numerical approximation of immediate reward values.

We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in a simulation environment and compare it with benchmark approaches. The results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior training metrics, notably lower residual variance and significantly improved reward stability, with the latter increasing by approximately 25%. Additionally, it ensures robust control performance, maintaining a zero accident rate even under challenging conditions of low V2X network reliability. Lastly, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can be effectively generalized across a variety of actor-critic frameworks."

    "abstract": "The exchange of information among distributed energy resources (DERs) in microgrids (MGs) relies on sensing and communication systems, which makes them vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. This article proposes an enhanced secondary control strategy based on an asynchronous self-triggered secure mechanism (ASTSM) for ac autonomous MGs operating under switching communication topologies and subject to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The proposed distributed edge-based resilient approach improves communication efficiency, reduces computational demands, and eliminates the continuous monitoring burden inherent in event-triggered schemes. Moreover, ASTSM is specifically designed to counter DDoS attacks launched by multiple adversaries while ensuring the exclusion of Zeno behavior. In the proposed framework, each communication edge between DERs is equipped with a local time-sequence update algorithm that pre-calculates the next triggering instant based on the most recent states, independent of other edges. This feature strengthens the resilience of the mechanism against DDoS attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in regulating voltage and frequency, achieving proportional active power sharing, and maintaining state-of-charge (SoC) balancing is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink under various operating scenarios."

    "abstract": "Robust low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability is a critical requirement for grid-forming (GFM) converters. While virtual impedance is a promising method to prevent overcurrent during faults, it does not fully mitigate the continuous divergence of the power angle under severe voltage sags. This deficiency results in transient instability and slow post-fault recovery. To address these issues, this article proposes a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>-axis current-based droop control strategy.

This adjustment establishes a new equilibrium point, thus guaranteeing transient stability regardless of the fault duration. Furthermore, the strategy facilitates a rapid post-fault recovery by naturally disengaging the current-limiting mode upon fault clearance. The proposed strategy offers significant practical advantages, as it eliminates the need for grid information or a phase-locked loop (PLL), and its modular design allows for simple integration with existing GFM control architectures. Simulation and experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems introduces significant uncertainty. As this uncertainty increases, transmission system operators maintain higher operational margins to ensure reliable operation. This limits the available transmission capacity and contributes to grid congestion. As a result, the system operator relies more on costly remedial actions such as generation redispatch and RES curtailment. This paper presents a chance-constrained congestion management model to minimize expected RES curtailment and generation cost in hybrid AC/DC grids. The model is based on a tractable Stochastic Optimal Transmission Switching (SOTS) formulation that optimizes the switching state of AC and DC transmission lines, RES curtailment, HVDC converter set-points, and generator dispatch. It captures continuous non-Gaussian uncertainty in RES forecast errors using Polynomial Chaos Expansion. The tractability of the model is further improved using relaxation of binary variables. Three case studies are conducted. First, the proposed model is compared against a stochastic optimal power flow and a MINLP SOTS model using a 5- bus AC/DC test system. Second, the impact of binary relaxation parameter and solver tolerance on the output probability distributions is analyzed using a 67- bus AC/DC test system. Third, scalability is demonstrated on a 588- bus AC/DC test system under different RES penetration levels and switching configurations. The results show that the model substantially reduces RES curtailment and operational costs. Moreover, it is at least an order of magnitude faster than the MINLP formulation while maintaining accuracy in the output distributions, and it remains tractable for large systems."

    "abstract": "Neighbor discovery in Underwater Acoustic Networks (UANs) faces challenges of high propagation delay, high energy consumption, and constrained spectral resources. This study proposes a Multiplexed Directional Transceiver Neighbor Discovery (MDT-ND) protocol that enhances discovery efficiency through adaptive space-time-frequency multiplexing. In the a priori detection phase, an initial omnidirectional broadcast rapidly captures coarse-grained parameters of neighboring nodes, including distance, direction, and activity state. For partially discovered nodes, the transmit power is adaptively adjusted to continue the discovery process. Meanwhile, nodes that remain undiscovered automatically adjust their receive gain. In the cognitive detection phase, the master node dynamically allocates orthogonal frequency bands for directional multi-beam verification. Real-time feedback is incorporated to jointly optimize beam alignment, resource allocation, and topology stability. Simulation results quantify node discovery efficiency and protocol convergence time under various channel conditions. Field trials conducted at Qiandao Lake demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves a neighbor discovery success rate of 98.2% within 8.4 seconds, validating its robustness and operational effectiveness in realistic underwater environments. The MDT-ND protocol is distinguished by its high channel resource utilization and simple implementation, enabling rapid and reliable neighbor node discovery even in challenging underwater environments."

    "abstract": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general -shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing."

We propose a novel structural topic modeling (STM) framework for the dynamic identification of in-demand GAIS using free-form job description texts. We use STM with real-time job postings data to discover in-demand GAIS and estimate the labor market premium associated with these skills. We illustrate the proposed framework using a large corpus of generative AI job postings to identify the ten most salient GAIS. Further, we show how skill identification can be conditioned on specific job characteristics, such as required experience or job location. Finally, we demonstrate how the STM framework can be used as a decision-support system, providing practical insights into various real-world decisions faced by engineering management professionals and organizations. Theoretically, our study contributes to the engineering management literature by operationalizing a dynamic capabilities approach to workforce agility. Practically, it provides an evidence-based tool for engineering managers to guide workforce development and hiring strategies using real-time labor market insights. More generally, our study offers a practical framework for engineering managers to continuously sense and respond to evolving labor market demands in fast-changing technological domains."

Existing deep learning methods often rely on pixel-wise error minimization, which limits their ability to model the underlying global structures. In this paper, we propose HyperFlow that is a two-stage conditional normalizing flow (CNF)-based SSR model. Specifically, in flow-based distribution mapping (FDM) stage, a CNF model learns a bijective mapping between HSI and standard Gaussian distributions with MSI as conditional input. To boost the interaction between conditional and latent features, a spatial-spectral affine coupling (SSAC) layer is designed to boost the bidirectional mapping by considering both spatial and spectral features of MSI. In patch-aware learnable sampling (PLS) stage, a learnable sampler that is guided by patch-level spatial-spectral information is employed to refine latent features, improving the quality of reconstructed HSIs. To evaluate the effectiveness of HyperFlow, we conduct experiments on three publicly available datasets and experimental results show that HyperFlow outperforms recent models.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has recently been nominated as a key technology and promising solution to enhance 6G wireless networks in the future. One major problem that RIS can mitigate is penetration loss, where the wave is susceptible to losing most of its power while passing through obstacles, especially at high frequencies. RIS can overcome this problem by defining alternative paths for waves with minimal losses by manipulating the electrical properties of its elements, thereby reshaping the pattern of the reflected beam. Moreover, RIS consumes less energy than traditional solutions such as relays and repeaters, which makes it preferable to 6G visions of green solutions. Therefore, this study proposes a design for an RIS array operating in the 2.4 GHz WiFi band as a proof of concept of showing the ability of RIS to enhance network performance in 6G at higher frequencies, and as a suggested practical design to improve users’ experience and satisfy their needs in the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band. The proposed single element exhibits a stable phase difference of 180° ± 20° and a loss of less than 2 dB. A 10 × 5 array showed gain improvement at different frequencies under different element configurations."

The system captures signals of obsolescence across four domains: corporate R&D, startup analysis, policy and foresight, and product lifecycle management. Responses are analyzed through a Random Forest- based framework that identifies key drivers of risk and classifies results into risk bands (low, moderate, high, critical). These results are dynamically linked to tailored managerial strategies, enabling firms to translate diagnostic outcomes into targeted interventions. Stakeholder feedback from SME (managers, traders, and R&D staff) highlights both the tool’s advantages- structured diagnosis, accessibility, actionability- and its limitations, including reliance on self-reported data and the need for sector-specific customization. By integrating human judgment with artificial intelligence, the study contributes a practical and theoretically grounded framework for managing innovation obsolescence and offers insights for firms seeking resilience in dynamic technological environments."

The aim of this paper is to provide us with an image of how we will be able to use one of the three storage solutions depending on the storage application. The three were subjected to a complete charge - discharge cycle, with monitoring of the corresponding specific parameters: voltage, current, power / energy, as evolution over time. The batteries were similarly charged from a universal charger, and the supercapacitor from a stabilized voltage source with the possibility of voltage regulation. The discharge cycle used a linear load corresponding to a normal use regime of these systems."

Models which can generate human-like text have evolved into multimodal systems that process different types of data like text, images and code. Some models stand out for their personalized learning and learning content creation capabilities, while others are strong in summarizing long and complex texts or in document processing and analytical tasks, and they offer different styles of interaction. The model specialized in Bulgarian language performs more effectively in localized educational tasks. The results show that DeepSeek achieves the highest content accuracy, ChatGPT demonstrates the strongest pedagogical value, and BgGPT excels in localized educational tasks in Bulgarian."

Elements such as candidate satisfaction, the learning curve required to understand and complete the processes, and the levels of frustration detected negatively impact fairness and effectiveness in skills assessment. This analysis represents the initial phase of a broader research project, whose ultimate goal is to develop gamified solutions grounded in a user-centered approach. In this initial stage, a qualitative study was conducted through in-depth interviews with six human resources specialists from different organizations, with the aim of identifying the limitations of conventional procedures and examining the perception of gamification as an improvement strategy. The findings indicate that conventional procedures result in a fragmented and unsatisfactory experience, imposing a high cognitive and emotional load on candidates. The specialists highlight persistent obstacles regarding clarity of instructions, limited feedback, unequal accessibility, and the lack of adaptability to diverse profiles. Likewise, they acknowledge the potential of game-based platforms to enhance motivation, reduce frustration, and provide more inclusive experiences. These findings underpin the design of a future quasi-experimental phase that will evaluate, using metrics such as the System Usability Scale (SUS), the comparative effectiveness of traditional versus gamified tools in selection processes."

Deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, the solution uses SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) to collect metrics on CPU, interface traffic, a nd s torage, while MikroTik routers establish encrypted VPN tunnels, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. T he i mplementation demonstrated stable performance: CPU between $\\mathbf{1 0 - 3 0 \\%}$, available memory of $297-408 \\mathrm{MB}$, and constant lossless VPN traffic, w ith projected throughput of $\\mathbf{5 0 0 ~ k b p s}$ to $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ M b p s}$ depending on load. Compared to traditional manual methods, this approach reduced incident detection time thanks to automated alerts via Telegram (the reduction in incident detection times with Telegram reduces latency compared to Gmail by an average of $\\mathbf{8 5 - 9 0 \\%}$) and improved data visibility thru Zabbix. This architecture offers a secure, costeffective, and scalable solution for telecommunications service providers and SMEs, providing a replicable model of reliable, efficient, and easily implementable remote monitoring in critical networks."

    "abstract": "This poster evaluated a four-month online professional development program helping seven Southeast Asian teachers from Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia embed Computational Thinking (CT) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) into their lesson plans. Through structured sessions and iterative planning cycles, participants co-created, implemented and revised lessons. Qualitative analysis of their plans, reflections and community discussions showed marked growth: early drafts featured only basic CT and UDL elements, whereas later versions incorporated advanced CT skills (decomposition, data analysis, pseudocoding) and UDL strategies (multiple means of engagement, representation and expression). These results suggest that reflective, collaborative professional development (PD) can boost teachers’ competence and confidence in delivering inclusive, computation-rich instruction."

    "abstract": "Exceptional behavior can be harmful to software quality and robustness. Like most modern programming languages, Java offers built-in mechanisms for expressing and handling exceptions. However, despite their languageintegrated design, exception handlers are easy to misuse. Researchers have identified exception-handling anti-patternsrecurring poor coding practices that threaten software quality. One of the most prevalent exception-handling anti-patterns-over-catching-occurs when a handler catches overly broad exception types, potentially obscuring the root cause of a failure. Integrated development environments (IDEs) play a critical role in helping developers identify and address software quality issues. Yet, existing tools can produce an overwhelming number of results, contributing to cognitive overload. To address this problem, we incorporate probabilistic reasoning into IDE-based exception-handling analysis. Exception Shipping & Handling (ESH), our prototype implementation, allows the IDE to present prioritized instances of the over-catch anti-patterns based on their likelihood of being problematic. We evaluate ESH through a user study focused on its usability for helping developers assess over-catching handlers. Our results show that participants found ESH intuitive and provide useful insights into how to integrate probabilistic reasoning into an IDE. Specifically, our study highlights the need for transparency and contextualized UI elements."

While these platforms engage students through visual and gamified interfaces, teachers often face challenges in using them effectively and finding all the necessary features for classroom management. To address these challenges, we introduce SnapClass, a classroom management system integrated within the Snap! programming environment. SnapClass was iteratively developed drawing on established research about the pedagogical and logistical challenges teachers encounter in computing classrooms. Specifically, SnapClass allows educators to create and customize block-based coding assignments based on student skill levels, implement rubric-based auto-grading, and access student code history and recovery features. It also supports monitoring student engagement and idle time, and includes a help dashboard with a “raise hand” feature to assist students in real time. This paper describes the design and key features of SnapClass those are developed and those are under progress."

The aim of the study was to investigate the use of a computational asynchronous distance learning environment and the correlation between the usage of developed practices and the newly acquired knowledge. An attempt was made to create a complete Moodle course guide without the requirement of any technical pre-existing knowledge. This paper also presents the results of the implemented survey on the feasibility and expediency of using e-learning.

The frequency spectrum being developed covers low (700 MHz), mid-band (2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz), and high ($26 \\mathrm{GHz} / \\mathrm{mmWave}$). This study aims to evaluate and plan 5 G network path loss using the Close-In (CI) model, chosen because it can realistically evaluate path loss, taking into account distance and operational frequency. The novelty of this study is the comparison of the CI model with empirical data and field measurements of already implemented 5G networks. This research provides a technical foundation for operators in evaluating path loss and serves as a reference in $\\mathbf{5 G}$ infrastructure planning, particularly regarding the efficient utilization of the mmWave spectrum. The results show that the CI model is effective in evaluating 5 G network implementation, particularly regarding path loss and shadow fading. The highest path loss values occurred at mmWave (26 GHz), at 21.19 dB LOS and 129.85 dB NLOS. The high values were influenced by scattering, absorption, and low signal penetration at high frequencies. Furthermore, the measured results were higher than the theoretical calculations, particularly under NLOS conditions, due to the complexity of physical barriers."

Power-flow simulations were performed in ETAP 19.0 for DER penetration levels of 10%, 20%, and 30%, applied under two alternative allocation strategies: (1) proportional DER allocation based on the local bus load, and (2) uniform DER allocation based on the average load of the system. The study evaluates the resulting active and reactive power losses, bus loading, branch loading, and system-level power factor. The simulation results demonstrate that DER integration reduces active power losses by up to 53.1% and reactive power losses by up to 49.5%, with corresponding improvements in the system power factor from the baseline value of 91.35% to 94.38% (Scenario 1 at 30% penetration) and 94.51% (Scenario 2 at 30% penetration). Branch-wise and bus-wise analyses further reveal how DER penetration redistributes flows across the network, alleviates loading on critical elements and enhancing overall operational efficiency. The power-flow analysis performed showed that after optimizing the location and power of DERs, the power factor increases from 91.35% (for the baseline) to 94.38% for Scenario 1 with 30%DERs and 94.51% for Scenario 2 with 30% DERs."

I propose research that investigates why software practitioners are drawn to general-purpose LLMs and how these tools fit into and enhance vibe coding experiences. In particular, I aim to understand how these environments affect productivity and well-being, especially for software practitioners with mental health conditions (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, depression).

    "abstract": "UAV-assisted heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in urban environments face significant challenges in optimizing trajectory, rate, and handover (HO) decisions under dense mobility and interference conditions. Existing approaches often fail to jointly address these factors, leading to inefficient resource allocation, frequent HO failures, and degraded user experience. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables cooperative UAV agents to optimize trajectory planning, network rate, and HO performance simultaneously. The model integrates signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), achievable rate, and HO-related parameters into the probability of identification (POI), ensuring accurate user association and sustained connectivity. A reward function is designed to balance rate maximization, HO frequency reduction, and trajectory efficiency, guiding agents toward optimal network performance. Simulation results, validated with ray tracing (RT) in realistic urban scenarios and benchmarked against 3GPP and NYM models, demonstrate that the proposed MARL framework achieves higher rate, lower HO failures, improved POI, and enhanced energy efficiency in complex urban HetNets."

This work evaluates the impact of using historical versus recent data for inflow prediction under changing hydrological conditions.

Two datasets were used for training: a short-term series and a long-term series. Predictions were generated for 2024, a year marked by severe droughts and energy shortages, and used to estimate annual hydropower generation. Results show that the short-term dataset closely matches actual generation ($0.33 \\%$ error), while the long-term dataset significantly overestimates output ($+10.13 \\%$). Although long records are generally assumed to improve model robustness, they may introduce outdated patterns due to environmental changes such as climate variability or other external influences. Findings highlight the importance of incorporating up-to-date climate signals to strengthen hydropower prediction frameworks and operational reliability."

Since the 1990s, mining activities have gradually ceased and the water quality in the Slana River has improved. However, the mine closure was not always carried out professionally, in particular, the disposal and treatment of water flowing from the mine drainage system and the reclamation of tailings ponds were not addressed. As a result, a mining disaster could have occurred, which on February 24, 2022 caused an extraordinary deterioration of the waters in the upper part of the Slana River in southern Slovakia. The aim of the project is to map and preserve the current state of the Slana River and the potential effects of pollution from abandoned mines in the Slana River Basin. The main output of the project will be an Environmental Assessment Study and Risk Assessment. The study will summarise the results of the interconnected measurements and surveys (geophysical measurements, one-year monitoring of groundwater and surface waters, modelling and other studies) carried out within the project, examining the impact of mines and mine tailings on the environment in the Slana River Basin, identifying risks of their magnitude and probability."

    "abstract": "Marchenko imaging provides a powerful framework for reconstructing amplitude-preserved subsurface images while suppressing migration artifacts caused by internal multiples. This capability is achieved by applying an energy-compensated cross-correlation imaging condition to the up- and down-going Green’s functions retrieved through the Marchenko scheme. However, the performance of this approach strongly depends on the choice of the integration range: an excessively large range lowers resolution in shallow areas, whereas an overly small range can degrade the imaging quality of steeply dipping structures. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive strategy that improves image quality by optimizing the integration range for each imaging point. The integration range is characterized by two parameters—the location of the integration center and the integration radius. Specifically, the radius is determined from the traveltime difference between the up- and down-going Green’s functions together with the depth of the imaging point, while the center location is constrained by stratal dip. The resulting optimal integration range, defined by these two parameters, is then applied to both the retrieval of Marchenko Green’s functions and the subsequent imaging. The proposed method was first tested on synthetic data, where it was shown to outperform fixed integration ranges (either too large or too small) by simultaneously enhancing shallow resolution and preserving the fidelity of steeply dipping structures. It was then further applied to field data from western China, which confirmed the feasibility of the approach."

Second, a tutoring-guiding mechanism is established to heuristically explore and sufficiently exploit valuable experience. Third, a mechanism consisting of progressive planner and inverse kinematics mapper is designed to cope with localized changes in the environment, which enables the robot manipulator to rapidly adapt to the newly changed environment. Finally, experimental results have verified the superior performance of the proposed approaches."

    "abstract": "Small open-ear headphones are comfortable because they do not block the auricle or ear canal, which eliminates the occlusion effect and enables users to hear ambient sounds naturally and achieve accurate binaural reproduction in principle. However, their significant sound leakage makes them less suitable for use in public spaces. While mitigating sound leakage is desirable, existing near-field reproduction technologies, such as speaker arrays, are costly to use in such compact acoustic devices. Hence, we designed an enclosure with a back air cavity and side-openings for small open-ear headphones that use a single speaker unit. This enclosure design can mitigate sound leakage by emitting opposite-phase sound waves from the back of the speaker unit. The headphone designs that achieve dipole radiation by emitting opposite-phase sound waves are well-suited for near-field reproduction, as the proximity effect enhances the low-frequency response in the near field. Moreover, this enclosure design enables the frequency characteristics of the opposite-phase sound waves to be controlled by altering the volume or the area and position of the openings in the enclosure at the back of the speaker unit. Evaluations were conducted using finite element method (FEM) simulations and measurements with a dummy head wearing headphones. Consequently, we found that the proposed side-opening enclosure design mitigated sound leakage to a greater extent than the studied alternatives, sealed and back-opening enclosures."

The speed control law using NDIC ensures the stability of the closed-loop control system of PMSMs once the motor parameters are measured properly, and the location of the closed-loop poles can be designed by any linear control method. After that, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which is widely used for optimal control design, is employed to determine the closed-loop poles of the control system. Combining the NDIC speed control law with the LQR pole placement method, the new method “NDICLQR” is developed for the speed control law of PMSMs. Since there will be only one parameter to be tuned in the NDICLQR method and a given cost function is minimized, the control system can be auto-tuned, which means that the user does not have to tune the independent control gains manually, as in the conventional field-oriented control (FOC)."

    "abstract": "In many hospitals, especially in resource-limited settings, neurosurgeons lack access to advanced intraoperative imaging, such as intraoperative MRI or CT. This limitation severely restricts their ability to adapt surgical plans in real-time, especially when anatomical changes occur during the procedure. One of the most critical of these changes is brain shift, a phenomenon where brain tissue deforms during surgery, reducing the accuracy of image-guided interventions. This study addresses that critical gap by introducing a finite element method (FEM)-based simulation that predicts brain shift using only standard preoperative imaging, MRI and CT. Unlike existing approaches that rely on intraoperative imaging or data-driven updates, the proposed method models deformation based on physical factors such as gravity, remaining cerebrospinal fluid, and brain–skull contact, using a static linear elastic formulation. The method is feasible, hardware-efficient, and deployable in typical clinical environments. Validation through phantom experiments confirmed the feasibility and clinical acceptability of the approach, achieving a mean lesion localization error of 1.94±0.59 mm and shift-correction improvement of 46.12±25.84% compared with conventional planning. With a total simulation time of under six minutes, the proposed approach provides a practical and scalable solution to support neurosurgical planning in settings without intraoperative imaging."

    "abstract": "For high power low speed permanent magnet motors (LSPMMs), which are typically large in size and often subject to installation space constraints, the tangential rotor structure is more favorable than the radial surface-mounted permanent magnet rotor design due to its ability to generate higher output torque within the same volume. An integrated tangential rotor structure that combines flux barriers with silicon steel laminations offers improved manufacturability and is more suitable for mass production. Nevertheless, current research lacks a comprehensive understanding of the design principles governing the integrated tangential rotor structure in LSPMMs. Therefore, this paper focuses on the detailed design rules of the integrated tangential rotor structure for high-power LSPMMs, include different rotor structures, magnetic isolation characteristic, electromagnetic properties, mechanical strength, etc. Firstly, based on a 1200kW 75rpm high power LSPMM, two kinds of integral tangential rotor structures are proposed. On this basis, the influence of different pole-slot combinations and sizes of magnetic isolation bridges on electromagnetic performance is analyzed in detail. Secondly, multi-objective optimization and mechanical strength analysis of two kinds of tangential rotor structures are carried out. Then, the electromagnetic performance and material consumption of two rotor structures are compared. Finally, a full size prototype is manufactured and tested to verify the theoretical analysis."

    "abstract": "Robotic automation in high-mix, low-volume settings often relies on structured workcells where fixtures, workpieces, and procedures are well defined, but tasks must be reconfigured quickly across variants. This paper presents the Design and Learning Research Group's solution to the euROBIN Manipulation Skill Versatility Challenge (MSVC) at IROS 2024, in which a standardized electronic task board is operated through a fixed sequence of subtasks. We deliberately adopt a simple, industry-style implementation: each subtask is taught by recording an open-loop Tool Center Point (TCP) and gripper trajectory in the task-board frame, a wrist-mounted depth camera is used once per run to localize the board and a few key features, and a web dashboard exposes the resulting motion primitives as reusable code blocks that can be reordered and reparameterized. With this pipeline, our system completes the benchmark in 28.2 s in the lab (37.2 s on-site), compared to a human baseline of 16.3 s and an average of 83.5 s for previous teams, closing a large part of the performance gap without advanced learning or feedback control. We further demonstrate limited skill transfer by retargeting the same subtask library to a smoke-detector battery replacement scenario required by the competition. Finally, we release our implementation as open source and discuss how competition design and benchmark structure influence the balance between simple engineered solutions and richer sensing and learning."

    "abstract": "Approximately 25% of all electricity worldwide is consumed by pumps, compressors, and blowers in industrial applications. High-speed electric machines based on magnetic suspension technology present a significant opportunity to improve the efficiency of these drivelines, thus reducing total energy consumption, costs, and pollution levels. However, a major challenge in adopting the high-speed drivelines in industrial applications lies in their implementation. The design lead time for such machines typically spans years, whereas an ideal time-frame would be mere weeks. This study presents a systematic multidisciplinary design process for thrust active magnetic bearing to accelerate design work. By structuring the design steps in a precise order, automation can be integrated to develop the design space, which can then be directly utilized in the system level design analysis. In practice, when another design area is modified, a thrust bearing design that fulfils the overall design requirements can be automatically updated from the design space. Consequently, non-viable solutions are directly excluded, reducing the iterative nature of high-speed machine system design. Part I of this paper details the methodology of the multidisciplinary design process, while Part II illustrates the application of the proposed design method using a one-megawatt high-speed electric machine for a heat pump compressor."

    "abstract": "The global escalation of cybercrime, particularly in South Africa, highlights alarming inadequacies in the law enforcement agencies’ capacity to handle such crimes, particularly in resource-limited areas like Nelspruit of the Mpumalanga Province. Offenses including identity theft, financial fraud, cyberbullying, and social media crimes demand specialised skills and an advanced technological infrastructure that is often unavailable at local level. This research analyses the cybercrime preparedness gaps of law enforcement agencies based in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga Province. It focuses on training capacity and the infrastructure technology institutional support.With law enforcement and cybersecurity academic professionals as units of analysis, primary data were collected through interviews. Interviews informed current practices in addition to pinpointing critical knowledge tool coordination gaps within their frameworks. Findings indicate that lack of expertise, outdated forensic tools, and poor inter-agency collaboration hinder local agencies from keeping pace with more sophisticated cyber threats.This paper also focuses on public-private partnership models while highlighting international collaborations for responding to cybercrimes and sharing innovative strategies to overcome the said problems. Moreover, the paper argues that effective measures require dual approaches including proactive technical measures, proactive ethics, and legal frameworks that sustain institutional adjustments.Establishment of dedicated cybercrime training facilities, modern investigative tools and funding, as well as better stakeholder collaboration were proposed in the study. To reinforce Nelspruit’s cybersecurity posture, the local law enforcement agencies need to boost their capacity and capability, which is the main focus area of the study."

We introduce JvWiki-Clean version 1.0, a reproducible, language-specific pipeline that converts the Javanese Wikipedia into a cleaner monolingual corpus. The pipeline has six stages: parsing, sentence segmentation, sentence-level language identification, orthographic normalization and code-switch filtering, deduplication, and article-level train-development-test splitting. Applied to the August 2025 dump, the pipeline reduces roughly eight hundred thousand segmented sentences to 13,550 Javanese sentences with improved quality and an average length of 16.5 tokens. We evaluate purity, leakage, deduplication, and sentence distribution, and we audit borderline cases caused by code-switching and disagreement between language identification tools. A sweep over the language-identification confidence threshold (tau) confirms a clear size-purity trade-off; throughout this paper we adopt tau equal to 0.90 as a balanced operating point. Despite the large reduction in size, the resulting corpus is, to our knowledge, among the larger openly available monolingual Javanese resources and is suitable for evaluation and lightweight finetuning. We publicly release the dataset and the associated scripts to support transparent and repeatable research. Future work will establish baselines for classification, part-of-speech tagging, and named-entity recognition, explore data augmentation and cross-lingual transfer with Indonesian, and extend the corpus with curated sources beyond Wikipedia while preserving auditability."

However, threats to message confidentiality and integrity remain significant concerns. This study proposes integrating Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography with RSA algorithm within a Telegram Bot framework. The approach first encrypts secret messages using RSA for cryptographic security, then embeds them into digital objects using LSB steganography to conceal their existence during transmission. The Telegram Bot facilitates automated, cross-platform communication accessible across different devices. Security performance is evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), where higher values indicate better imperceptibility and detection resistance. Experimental results demonstrate that combining RSA with LSB enhances both confidentiality and robustness while maintaining media quality. The main contribution is designing and implementing a secure Telegram Bot that unifies cryptography and steganography, providing a practical solution for safeguarding digital communication through an accessible, user-friendly interface."

Existing textual data is generally unbalanced, so a special approach is needed to develop a multi-class classification model. In this study, a model was developed for emotion detection in multi-class using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). The research stages include dataset acquisition, preprocessing, pretrained model Global Vectors for Word Representation (Glove), developing model, and model evaluation. The public dataset was obtained under imbalanced conditions, with 422,746 data points. The undersampling approach was used to overcome data imbalance. The Bi-LSTM method was used to develop the model, and the results obtained an accuracy value of 0.87 and outperformed the use of imbalanced data. The resulting model was able to classify multi-class well."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks by design since it cannot inspect clients’ local data to protect their privacy. This privacy-preserving feature creates an opportunity for malicious clients to introduce backdoors. However, existing backdoor attacks face two main limitations. First, brute amplification (i.e., uniformly scaling up malicious parameters) can be easily detected, hence compromising attack stealthiness. Second, evasion strategies employed to prevent their backdoors from being overwritten by benign updates are frequently ineffective, reducing the overall attack stability upon model deployment. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive proactive boosting strategy to enhance both the stealthiness and durability of backdoor attacks in FL. As a concrete example, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReBA</i> introduces a durable importance metric based on stability degrees of parameters as an update mask for malicious attackers, assigning higher weights to backdoor-related parameters during the update process. To ensure stealthiness, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReBA</i> formulates an optimization problem regarding amplification factor by minimizing the distance between malicious and clean updates, thereby correcting malicious updates within a benign distance space. Extensive evaluations on 3 datasets and across 14 defenses demonstrate the efficacy of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReBA</i>, outperforming over 12 baseline backdoor attacks.

    "abstract": "Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), a well-known density-based clustering algorithm, has gained widespread popularity and usage due to its effectiveness in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noisy data. However, it encounters challenges in producing satisfactory cluster results when confronted with datasets of varying density scales, a common scenario in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</b>daptive and <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</b>obust <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DBSCAN</b> with Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning cluster framework, namely<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AR-DBSCAN</b>. First, we model the initial dataset as a two-level encoding tree and categorize the data vertices into distinct density partitions according to the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">information uncertainty</i> determined in the encoding tree. Each partition is then assigned to an agent to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. The allocation is density-adaptive, enabling AR-DBSCAN to effectively handle diverse density distributions within the dataset by utilizing distinct agents for different partitions. Second, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning guided automatic parameter searching process is designed. The process of adjusting the parameter search direction by perceiving the clustering environment is modeled as a Markov decision process. Using a weakly-supervised reward training policy network, each agent adaptively learns the optimal clustering parameters by interacting with the clusters. Third, a recursive search mechanism adaptable to the data's scale is presented, enabling efficient and controlled exploration of large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine artificial datasets and a real-world dataset. The results of offline and online tasks show that AR-DBSCAN not only improves clustering accuracy by up to 144.1% and 175.3% in the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) metrics, respectively, but also is capable of robustly finding dominant parameters."

    "abstract": "Security and privacy concerns in real-world applications have led to the development of adversarially robust federated models. Previous works mainly target overcoming the adaptability constraints regarding communication and computation costs. However, the straightforward combination of adversarial training and federated learning might lead to undesired robust accuracy degradation emerging at later training stages. We reveal that the attribution behind this phenomenon is that the generated adversarial data could exacerbate the data heterogeneity among local clients, making the wrapped federated learning perform poorly. To deal with this problem, we introduce an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\alpha$</tex-math></inline-formula>-slack mechanism to relax the original learning objective of federated adversarial training, and propose a novel framework called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Slack Federated Adversarial Training</i> (SFAT) to combat the intensified heterogeneity. By assigning the client-wise slack during aggregation, SFAT realizes a weighted aggregation that alleviates the optimization bias induced by the local adversarial generation. We further extend to a more general setting, permitting both clients trained by standard/adversarial training in a unified framework, and propose SFAT* with a hierarchical aggregation schema for this scenario. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence of our method to properly relax the learning objective. Experimentally, we verify the rationality and effectiveness of our methods on various benchmarked and real-world datasets with different adversarial training and federated optimization methods."

    "abstract": "AI accelerators are vital for the efficient execution of data-heavy workloads across various environments, but increased design complexity and shrinking manufacturing processes lead to severe reliability issues (with insidious behavior like silent data corruptions—SDCs). While CPU reliability has been analyzed significantly, AI accelerators require tailored analysis due to their diverse and evolving designs. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology for the evaluation of the reliability of systolic array-based AI accelerators harnessing the power of microarchitectural modeling. Our approach captures the entire compute stack—from software to gates—across a wide range of design points including dataflows, datatypes, memory hierarchies, and array sizes. We support statistical fault injection on key hardware structures (SRAMs, registers, functional units), supporting a wide range of fault models, and implement speedup techniques that significantly boost the injection throughput (more than 1000×) without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on diverse ML models reveal SDC vulnerability trends across accelerator design-points highlighting the effectiveness of our methodology for broad design space exploration."

    "abstract": "Partial discharge (PD) is a localized insulation failure that occurs without completely bridging the electrodes. While PD in sinusoidal excitations has been extensively studied with conventional detection and analysis methods, wide bandgap (WBG)-based electric drives introduce new challenges due to their high-frequency and high-speed switching. These features give rise to non-uniform voltage and charge distributions, along with voltage overshoot and ringing, governed by a geometry of PD object and drive parameters such as switching frequency and slew rate. Moreover, these fast-switching transients complicate PD detection due to electromagnetic interference (EMI). This paper reviews PD characteristics in WBG-based drives, highlighting the challenges in WBG-based drives. The review explores opportunities to improve PD location prediction through voltage distribution analysis based on the impedance of PD objects, as well as to optimize insulation design by considering charge distribution and methods for reducing the electric field across the insulation. Furthermore, it discusses methods to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of PD detection, including a reduction of common-mode voltage (CMV) and current with active EMI filters, thereby enhancing detection reliability in WBG-based electric drives."

However, some subject domains and complex algorithms from the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning usually requires processing large datasets, comprising of millions of instances or elements. In this case, knowing the relative performance of each control structure allows programmers to select the one that will perform best for large amounts of data. The goal of this paper is to conduct a series of experiments and performance evaluation of alternative programming techniques, mostly different type of loop structures, in order to determine the ones that provide higher performance for large datasets."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of low transmission rate and poor bit error rate (BER) performance in traditional Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) systems, this letter proposes a novel position-index-modulation-based DCSK scheme. Each row of the Walsh code matrix is used to perform a Kronecker product with the initial reference signal to generate multiple orthogonal signals. Each orthogonal signal independently undergoes position index modulation and carries modulated bits to transmit information. Position index modulation labels each time slot of each subcarrier in the system frame structure as a unique position indexed sequentially. According to the rules of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-combination mapping, one or more active positions are selected from all positions to transmit corresponding orthogonal signals. At the receiver, a sliding average denoising technique is introduced to reduce noise variance and enhance system reliability. Additionally, BER expressions are derived under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves higher transmission rates and better BER performance compared with several DCSK-based schemes proposed in recent years."

By embedding instantaneously measured metrics—signal-to-noise ratio, propagation delay, direction-of-arrival misalignment, and maximum-ratio combining gain—into a unified cost function, our system dynamically selects optimal inter-satellite and ground-station links. A three-tier control architecture leverages GEO satellites as central software defined networking controllers, MEO nodes for regional forwarding, and LEO craft for fine-grained telemetry reporting. Extensive simulations on a Walker-Delta constellation under different array sizes, update intervals, direction of arrival error levels, and interference conditions demonstrate notable reductions in end-to-end latency, significant improvements in throughput, and substantial drops in packet loss compared to snapshot- and signal to noise ratio-only baselines. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further validates the robustness and onboard feasibility of our hybrid software defined networking–beamforming approach for next-generation non-terrestrial networks."

This study addresses this challenge by developing a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to produce high-fidelity synthetic histopathology images. Leveraging the Cancer-Net PCa dataset, our DCGAN, featuring over 51 million parameters, was trained for 200 epochs to generate realistic images. The model’s performance was rigorously evaluated, demonstrating stable training dynamics with generator and discriminator losses converging at 0.6526 and 0.6953, respectively. A significant improvement in image quality was confirmed by the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score, which dropped from an initial value of approximately 400 to 211.89. While the model showed high precision, limitations in image diversity were identified, indicating an area for future enhancement. Futhermore, we trained several transfer learning models on the augmented dataset using the proposed DCGAN model where the EfficientNetV2 performed the best at $97.02 \\%$ accuracy and an improvement of $\\mathbf{5. 4 2 \\%}$ over the original dataset, demonstrating a state-of-the-art result among the other established GAN models. The results affirm the potential of DCGANs to effectively augment medical datasets, paving the way for more robust and accurate diagnostic tools in the fight against prostate cancer."

As 6G networks are envisioned to be inherently adaptive—capable of responding to diverse services, user mobility, and dynamic workloads—the architectural flexibility of the UPF becomes increasingly critical. Implementations of the UPF have burgeoned across a wide range of architectural models from centralized designs to distributed, edge-deployed, containerized, and hardware-accelerated configurations. However, existing studies often examine isolated technical facets devoid of a unified framework for comparison. This paper introduces a novel taxonomy with multiple layers that systematically categorizes UPF designs across five independent dimensions: location within the network topology, the computing platform employed, the software engineering approach, the licensing model adopted, and integration capabilities. The proposed framework is then applied to systematically examine and contrast the principal UPF implementation types delineated within the taxonomy, highlighting their respective trade-offs in terms of latency optimization, scalability, orchestration complexity, and deployment maturity. In addition, a comparative simulation-based evaluation is conducted for three representative UPF archetypes, each aligned with a distinct design category. Overall, this study presents a novel and comprehensive analysis of UPF architectures, offering valuable insights for network architects and researchers. It supports the informed selection, optimization, evolution, or replacement of UPF implementations to effectively meet the stringent performance and flexibility requirements of future 6G networks."

While traditional cloud-based solutions offer advanced capabilities, they face limitations in terms of latency, privacy, and bandwidth usage. In this context, Edge Computing has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling local and fast processing of video data through embedded artificial intelligence models. This review article presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in real-time detection of thefts and weapons using Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI). A total of 30 scientific articles published between 2018 and 2025 were selected and categorized, taking into account detection models, computing platforms, evaluation metrics, datasets, and real-world applications. The results highlight the predominant use of lightweight convolutional neural networks, especially YOLO-based models, implemented on devices such as Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, and Google Coral. Key challenges addressed include detection under lowlight conditions, identification of small or partially concealed weapons, and the reduction of false positives. The review identifies gaps in the current literature, such as the lack of annotated real-world datasets and the need for behavior-based models in retail contexts. Finally, emerging trends and future research directions are discussed, aiming at the development of efficient, accurate, and privacy-respecting Edge AI systems for real-time security surveillance."

    "abstract": "Global shifts in climate patterns are exerting growing pressure on agricultural systems, particularly in equatorial regions where crop productivity is directly tied to microclimatic conditions. This study investigated the relationship between ambient temperature and soil temperature under three surface conditions—bare soil, dry organic mulch, and live grass cover—using six years of continuous data (2015-2020) from tropical agricultural lands in coastal Ecuador. Soil temperature was measured at 20 cm depth, and the analysis integrated descriptive statistics, linear regression models, and Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify the interaction between air and soil thermal behavior. Additionally, the Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator were applied to detect temporal trends. The findings revealed statistically significant correlations between ambient and soil temperatures across all conditions. However, soils with vegetative cover demonstrated greater thermal stability and lower variability, highlighting their moderating role. Notably, a consistent downward trend was detected in both ambient air (-23.22%) and in soils with grass (-32.63%) and mulch (-28.54%) cover. These patterns suggest that vegetative layer’s function as passive thermal regulators, buffering soils against climatic fluctuations. These insights have practical implications for agricultural and agro-industrial management. By promoting soil protection strategies, such as mulching or live cover maintenance, it is possible to mitigate thermal stress, optimize resource use, and enhance system resilience. Continuous soil-climate monitoring is recommended to guide adaptation efforts and ensure sustainability under future climate variability."

The system adopts a RESTful architecture built with Vue.js and Laravel on a MySQL database, incorporating innovative features such as QR codedriven assessment and dynamic rubric management. Security is enforced through JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) following OWASP guidelines. PUCEmprende reduces event coordination time from weeks to hours, offers real-time monitoring and competency measurement, and automates result reporting and certificate issuance. The findings demonstrate that PUCEmprende transforms traditional entrepreneurship event management by delivering a scalable, secure, and maintainable solution for academic settings."

    "abstract": "The lack of effective mechanisms to guarantee labor welfare continues to impact both workers and organizations, especially in regions where institutional support is limited. In response to this situation in Ocaña, Colombia, B_Welfare was conceived as a web-based platform aimed at improving the physical, emotional, and organizational health of workers. This article describes the design and modeling of the platform based on a mixed methods methodology. Data was collected from fifty local workers through a structured survey whose content validity was verified by expert judgment using Aiken’s V coefficient. A complementary quantitative analysis was conducted using secondary labor statistics. The platform integrates modules addressing key factors such as workplace communication, ergonomics, and emotional stability. The technological implementation was performed using React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Python-based Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. B_Welfare is proposed as a tool for both workers and companies to monitor, support and strengthen occupational health and performance in a total way."

    "abstract": "As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, ensuring secure and transparent tracking of their charging activities has emerged as a critical challenge. Traditional centralized methods are vulnerable to data integrity issues and lack resilience, raising concerns about trustworthiness. This work presents a blockchain-enhanced architecture for auditing EV charging sessions. It offloads Charging Data Records (CDRs) to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), while preserving their integrity through cryptographic anchors recorded on an Ethereum-compatible smart contract. This approach strikes a balance between decentralization and system performance. A prototype was developed featuring OCPP-based session simulation and automated verification via smart contracts. Experimental evaluation across thousands of test cases confirmed the system's ability to detect data tampering with minimal processing overhead, especially when integrated with Layer-2 scaling technologies. These results demonstrate the framework's potential to improve transparency and trust in EV charging networks."

This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time FPGA-based wideband signal generator tailored for SMR applications. Unlike conventional methods that rely on pre-generated digital waveforms or expensive RFSoC platforms, the proposed design generates continuous-wave and chirp signals directly within the FPGA, ensuring flexibility, cost efficiency, and portability. A custom hardware architecture composed of Direct Digital Synthesis modules, an SMR chirp generator, and a JESD-compatible high-speed DAC interface was implemented on a ZCU102 FPGA platform. The generator successfully produced 40 ns short CW pulses and 4 μs LFM chirp pulses within a complete PRI structure, achieving up to 50 MHz instantaneous bandwidth at 1 GSPS DAC output with only ~11% LUT, 10% FF, 30% BRAM utilization, and ~3.9 W power consumption. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of real-time SMR waveform generation, providing an accessible alternative to costly RFSoC or SDR-based solutions for both research and operational radar systems."

    "abstract": "Sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks are expected to shift from throughput-centric provisioning to human-centric service delivery, where the network continuously adapts to each user’s situation. A promising yet unexplored dimension of this vision is emotion-aware networking—the ability of the infrastructure to sense a user’s emotional state and adjust user plane behavior in real time. This paper introduces the first Artificial-Intelligence-enabled Distributed User Plane Function (AID-UPF) framework that embeds multimodal emotion recognition directly into the 5G/6G user plane. Each edge-deployed UPF hosts a lightweight inference engine that tags active flows with the user’s current emotion, enabling per-packet QoS, dynamic routing, and adaptive scheduling policies that reflect instantaneous user sentiment. An AID-UPF orchestrator coordinates model distribution and state synchronization across a multi-tier UPF mesh while preserving privacy through federated learning and on-device preprocessing. Potential applications—such as emotion-sensitive healthcare, adaptive learning, and stress-aware mobility—suggest how such architectures could personalize service delivery and improve user alignment. By embedding emotional intelligence into distributed packet handling, the AID-UPF framework sets the stage for truly human-centric 6G networks."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the delay effects in the stability augmentation system (SAS) of an aircraft longitudinal dynamics using the Boeing 747 as a representative case. The SAS plays a crucial role in enhancing the inherent dynamic stability and handling qualities of the aircraft by providing automatic feedback that improves damping and response characteristics. It effectively suppresses oscillatory motion, particularly the short-period and phugoid modes, ensuring smooth pitch attitude control, and improved overall flight performance, efficiency, and passenger comfort. In practical flight control systems, however, feedback delay is unavoidable and may arise from multiple sources, including sensor dynamics, signal transmission, actuator lag, and digital computation time. Even small delays can significantly affect closed-loop stability and degrade flying qualities. To investigate this effect, a linearized state-space model of the Boeing 747 is developed, and a SAS is designed under nominal, delay-free conditions. The stability of the delayed system is then examined by analyzing the variation in the real and imaginary parts of the dominant roots with respect to the feedback delay. For the first time, it is shown that the feedback delay has a pronounced effect on the short-period mode, causing reduced damping and slower transient response, whereas the phugoid mode remains almost insensitive to delay variations. These observations are confirmed through detailed numerical simulations conducted on the Boeing 747 longitudinal model, which validate the analytical findings and quantify the extent of delay-induced degradation. The results highlight the importance of incorporating delay-aware stability analysis into the design and certification process of modern flight control systems. The findings provide new insight into the sensitivity of longitudinal dynamics to delay, offering a foundation for the development of robust and delay-tolerant augmentation systems."

In this paper, we present MOAT, a novel hardware-assisted, cross-platform isolation framework designed to protect the kernel from malicious BPF programs. MOAT introduces a two-layer memory isolation scheme that leverages hardware features such as Intel MPK and Arm Stage-2 translation to enforce isolation. Our design overcomes several key challenges, including the limited scalability of available hardware isolation mechanisms and the risk of helper function abuse. We implement MOAT for Intel x86 and Arm on Linux (ver. 6.1.38), and our evaluation shows that MOAT delivers low-cost isolation of BPF programs under mainstream use cases, such as isolating a BPF packet filter with only 3% throughput loss."

Cooperative navigation has emerged as a promising paradigm by leveraging inter-vehicle information exchange and multi-source information fusion to enhance swarm navigation performance. Although numerous surveys have summarized multi-sensor integration and state estimation methods for single-platform UAVs, comprehensive reviews dedicated to cooperative navigation remain limited. This paper presents a structured framework for cooperative navigation that integrates multi-source information acquisition, cooperative localization techniques in GNSS-denied environments, and multi-source fusion algorithms. On this basis, we provide a systematic review of cooperative navigation from three perspectives: relative measurement information, cooperative navigation architectures, and swarm cooperative optimization algorithms. Furthermore, fusion algorithms are categorized into four classes, namely mathematically derived, graph-based, filtering-based, and learning-based approaches, with their development trends systematically analyzed. The synergistic features of multi-source information are then discussed, with emphasis on information selection, fault tolerance, and resilient fusion. Finally, the hierarchical structure of multi-source information fusion is highlighted, revealing the evolutionary trend from feature-level toward decision-level strategies. This survey aims to present a holistic understanding of UAV cooperative navigation, outline key technical challenges, and shed light on future research directions in this rapidly evolving field."

    "abstract": "The ultra-low latency requirements of emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications necessitate data transmission in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, while non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enables massive connectivity. However, the practical imperfection of successive interference cancellation (SIC), a key component of NOMA, can significantly degrade system performance. This paper proposes the use of improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) to mitigate interference caused by imperfect SIC in an uplink NOMA system operating in the FBL regime. Specifically, users are grouped into pairs to form NOMA groups, where IGS is applied at the strong user in each pair to suppress residual interference. A minimum effective-throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user grouping, blocklength allocation, power allocation, IGS circularity coefficient, and decoding error probability. To address the resulting non-convex and mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient algorithm that achieves a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme with IGS-FBL outperforms various benchmark schemes, especially under severe imperfect SIC and stringent decoding error probability requirement conditions. Particularly, at a maximum decoding error probability of 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−4</sup>, the proposed scheme with IGS-FBL achieves the minimum effective-throughput that is 14.1×, 38.0×, and 98.8× greater than the benchmark schemes employing IGS-infinite blocklength (IGS-IFBL), proper Gaussian signaling-FBL (PGS-FBL), and PGS-IFBL, respectively."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled aerial monitoring assisted by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), in which one UAV aims to monitor a number of moving targets, and one STAR-RIS is installed on a building for assisting the UAV to broadcast the monitored information to both indoor and outdoor users. Due to the randomness of target movements over time, the UAV needs to adaptively adjust its flight trajectory to track them. This thus results in highly dynamic channel conditions and uncertain UAV energy consumption, which accordingly make the efficient aerial monitoring a challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a STAR-RIS-aided UAV-enabled aerial monitoring framework, which aims to maximize the long-term average throughput for all users, through joint optimization of transmit beamforming, UAV trajectory, and STAR-RIS configuration, while ensuring the monitoring requirements under strict energy constraints. The formulated problem is a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem, due to the randomness of various system parameters. To handle this problem, we apply the Lyapunov optimization technique and introduce a virtual energy queue to transform it into a series of single-slot optimization subproblems that are solvable online. For each subproblem, we develop efficient algorithms to obtain a near-optimal solution, in which a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) approach is used for the transmit beamforming and STAR-RIS configuration optimization, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is used for UAV trajectory optimization. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms benchmark schemes, effectively maximizing the throughput and energy efficiency under dynamic operational conditions."

The method combines mirror-image theory with transmission-optics-based phase regulation, enabling beam steering through a reconfigurable digital meta-surface that replaces the conventional ground plane. A planar dual-polarized dipole is positioned above the meta-surface, and beam steering is achieved by digitally switching the PIN-diode states to alter the discrete reflection-phase distribution. The prototype, fabricated and characterized at 12–14 GHz, demonstrates wide-angle beam steering with stable gain, low cross-polarization, and FPGA-based real-time digital control.

    "abstract": "Tropospheric delay is a major limitation in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for measuring landslide deformation. It exhibits complex spatial-temporal variability, stochastic behavior, and is particularly difficult to model in the mountainous areas of southwest China, where terrain is highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of tropospheric delay is therefore critical for improving the precision of InSAR-based landslide monitoring. In this study, we propose a tropospheric delay correction method that explicitly accounts for its periodic characteristics and evaluate its applicability in landslide monitoring across the mountainous regions of southwest China. By analyzing the temporal characteristics of tropospheric delay, we examine its periodic properties and construct a model that combines periodic and stochastic properties to estimate the delay. The method is applied to Sentinel-1 time-series InSAR data in southwestern mountainous study areas, with performance assessed at the levels of interferograms, linear deformation rates, and time-series. Results show that, in both study areas, more than 98% of single-master interferograms exhibit a reduced standard deviation (std), with average reductions exceeding 40% and maximum improvements surpassing 80% in interferometric phase std. These findings demonstrates that the proposed temporal tropospheric delay correction method effectively accounts for both time-related and stochastic components of tropospheric delay, substantially mitigating its impact spatially and temporally. Consequently, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of InSAR-based landslide monitoring."

Conventional centralized architectures typically depend on a single trusted authority for vehicle authentication and data integrity validation, which further increases susceptibility to unauthorized access, data tampering, and system disruption. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel distributed blockchain-based authentication mechanism for Internet of Vehicles and autonomous vehicles. The proposed approach leverages decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to securely authenticate vehicles within a decentralized network. Extensive experimental evaluations assess the system’s performance across multiple parameters, including latency, trust, and resilience to attacks. Comparative analysis demonstrates a significant improvement in trustworthiness and authenticity, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

This study evaluates the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures modified with walnut shell ash (WSA) and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP). Laboratory tests were conducted to determine resistance, durability, and behavior under different loading conditions using the Marshall method. Three different percentages of WSA $(7 \\%, 10 \\%$, and $13 \\%)$ and RAP ($10 \\%, 20 \\%$, and 30%) were incorporated into conventional asphalt mixtures with asphalt cement contents of $5.5 \\%, 6.0 \\%$, and $6.5 \\%$. The results show that the addition of these alternative materials can improve certain asphalt properties, contributing to sustainability in road construction despite a marginal cost increase of ${\\$} 16.79$ per $\\mathbf{m}^3$. The modified mixture with $7 \\%$ WSA and $10 \\%$ RAP at $6.5 \\%$ asphalt content achieved the best performance with a stability of 3803 lb and flow of 13.87 hundredths of an inch, meeting Marshall criteria. The implementation cost analysis shows an increase of ${\\$} 16.79$ per $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ compared to conventional mixtures, offset by environmental benefits and waste utilization. This work demonstrates the technical feasibility of incorporating agricultural waste and recycled materials in asphalt mixtures, promoting sustainable road construction practices."

This paper presents a machine learning approach to enhance FANET performance by predicting network conditions and optimizing packet delivery. We constructed a comprehensive dataset using BonnMotion to simulate UAV mobility and ns-3 to emulate network communications, capturing features such as channel busy ratio and queue lengths. Addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and conducting exploratory data analysis, we trained a CatBoost model and integrated it into ns-3 via ns3-ai for real-time operation. Compared to baseline and traditional EDCA methods, our approach increased the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) from below $15 \\%$ to approximately $80 \\%$, while reducing end-to-end delay from over 0.45 s to around 0.19 s.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, variable frequency drives (VFDs) are ubiquitous in every heavy industry. The cement industry was one of the pioneering industries to adopt variable frequency drives and realize efficiency and productivity gains from their use. Advanced and complex equipment including fans, conveyors, crushers, and kilns benefit from the addition of VFDs inside the modernized concrete plant.The total cost of ownership (TCO) of a variable frequency drive depends on several factors. While the initial cost of equipment (capital expense) may play a key role in selecting the equipment, neglecting the life-cycle cost (operating expense) may result in netfinancial loss. The TCO of a drive is determined by factors including, but not limited to, the initial cost of equipment, installation cost, cost of cabling, initial cost of cooling system, energy costs, operating cost of cooling system, and cost of maintenance. Additionally, the financial savings associated with drives must be accounted for in the complete TCO analysis. Topics such as energy savings, reduction of emissions, reduction in repair/maintenance costs of mechanical systems, motor reliability improvements, process enhancements, electrical system impacts, and reliability improvements will be discussed.Finally, this paper details the several types of maintenance (reactive vs. proactive) and investigates the impact of utilization of condition monitoring systems on reduction of downtime and total cost of ownership."

This paper analyzes Ecuadorian regulations that govern and determine leasing fees for the use of passive infrastructure, through a review and analysis of applicable legislation related to ducts and poles, including norms issued by relevant governmental entities. The analysis identifies the existence of two regulatory frameworks-one from the electricity sector and another from the telecommunications sector-which assign different rates to the use of poles. This duality creates ambiguity for telecommunications service providers and affects the provision of fixed broadband services. The current situation also reflects Ecuador’s relatively low position in international indices concerning regulatory environment and quality."

The study data are obtained from the application of a reference model for supply chains, consisting of 15 variables and 120 items. Based on these results, and based on a quantitative analysis and a procedure for applying three machine learning methods, the data analysis was correlated, the importance of the variables was identified, the most relevant ones were selected, the level of development was predicted, and the performance of the methods was evaluated. The study’s findings imply that these machine learning methods could be valuable tools for decision-making and optimization in supply chain management. By implementing the models, it was demonstrated that the optimization function of each allows parameters to be adjusted to improve their predictive capacity. As a result, a high regression coefficient was obtained with all three methods."

Noise level measurements revealed that several areas exceeded the Indonesian Minister of Environment Decree No. 48 of 1996 standard of 55 dB for educational facilities. Simulations identified the highest noise level, 72 dB, in the pastry room near a pipe system, the main noise source. Other affected areas included the bakery room, kitchen, storage spaces, and serving areas, with levels ranging from 58 dB to 68 dB. To mitigate these issues, the study recommends installing sound-absorbing barriers, using noise-dampening covers for equipment, and providing ear protection for personnel. These findings provide actionable insights to enhance acoustic comfort and create a conducive learning environment within educational laboratories."

The modeling was carried out in ANSYS Fluent using steady-state RANS (SIMPLE, second-order spatial discretization) with the k–ω SST turbulence model and a consistent atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) implementation: a logarithmic inflow velocity profile and compatible turbulence quantities (u*, z0, k, ω) were generated via a user.prof file. Preservation of the ABL was verified in an “empty” domain of the same height. Comparison with field data (mean velocities at ≈1.75–1.8 m above ground) shows that proper ABL specification is critical for credible near-ground speeds; without ABL, pronounced systematic errors occur. In the mitigation part, we investigate rounded/chamfered high-rise edges (reducing mean speeds in the leeward near-ground zone by roughly 20%) and evergreen tree belts modeled as porous media (achieving a twofold reduction of the mean speed at a control point). The results are interpreted through mechanism-based reasoning (downwash, corner acceleration, channeling) and the frameworks of Lawson’s criteria and the Dutch standard NEN 8100. A practical workflow is proposed for municipal wind microclimate screening at early design stages."

The main challenge is to determine the most appropriate algorithm to produce an accurate diagnosis. One approach that can improve diagnostic accuracy is deep metric learning, which is applied to analyze medical images efficiently. This review aims to analyze various deep learning algorithms and deep metric learning methods in detecting disease in medical images. This methodology uses PRISMA as a framework for the systematic study search and selection process. Literature obtained from the Scopus and IEEE Xplore databases, includes papers published between 2019 and 2024, with a focus on medical image classification using a deep metric learning approach. From the search results, 442 studies were found, and 12 of them met the inclusion criteria for further review. This research not only focuses on algorithm selection, but also analyzes classification metrics used to evaluate model performance in various diagnosis tasks. The study reveals that dice scores and contrastive learning are popular learning metrics to improve model performance. Additionally, instead of just using accuracy, the model is evaluated using specificity and sensitivity metrics, providing a deeper understanding of its effectiveness."

This paper investigates the feasibility of direct electromagnetic (EM) links for cross-medium communication, leveraging Unmanned Aerial and Underwater Vehicles (UA(U)Vs) as mobile nodes. We present a simulation study focusing on optimizing the excitation of antenna arrays to enhance signal strength at a receiver located near or across a medium boundary. The performance is evaluated using the Rayleigh Quotient method to maximize the signal at the target receiver by controlling the amplitude and phase of array elements. Scenarios include arrays above and below a dielectric half-space (modeling land/sea) and the water-air interface. The results demonstrate that strategic array excitation can significantly enhance cross-medium link reliability by focusing energy across and/ or through the boundary. These findings underscore the potential of optimized EM systems, rather than traditional acoustics, for short-range, high-data-rate cross-medium links, with UAVs and UUVs acting as intelligent, adaptive transceivers."

Second, we explore how these real-time insights facilitate dynamic brand messaging and agile strategy adaptation. Third, the paper investigates the application of AI agents in driving hyper-personalized consumer engagement and conversion, analyzing their quantifiable impact on marketing ROI and customer loyalty. Fourth, we provide a concise overview of the modular architecture that underpins these intelligent systems. Finally, we conduct a critical analysis of the profound ethical challenges, including algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the need for new governance frameworks. We conclude that while AI agents offer unprecedented capabilities for brand optimization, their effective and responsible deployment requires a renewed focus on human-centric strategy, ethical oversight, and brand authenticity."

It has a qualitative methodology, based on a content analysis, focused on selected scenes from the film, organized into three categories: representation of scientific knowledge, relationship between science and society, and implicit epistemology. The results show that Interstellar allows complex concepts to be represented in an accessible and critical way, as well as to generate spaces for reflection on the nature and limits of scientific knowledge. It is concluded that the systematic use of cinema in the classroom favors interdisciplinary learning, fosters critical scientific literacy and opens new possibilities for a more contextualized, reflective and formative teaching of physics.

Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a novel methodology that enables GUM-based uncertainty evaluation in ML-based measurements. The primary focus is on ML deterministic regression models, whose structure can be readily assimilated to measurement operations. The proposed methodology is applied to two representative case studies. The first case study involves an electric circuit for resistance measurement, where a comparison between ML-based approaches and a consolidated measurement model is provided to ensure consistency. The second case study concerns the estimation of the output power of a power plant, where no conventional measurement model is available. Overall, the proposed methodology enables proper integration of ML practices into the GUM framework, thus broadening the application domain of measurement processes."

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) presents greater optimization challenges than single-task learning (STL) due to conflicting gradients across tasks. While parameter sharing promotes cooperation among related tasks, many tasks require specialized representations. To balance cooperation and specialization, we propose Mod-Squad [1], a modular transformer-based model composed of a “squad” of experts. Each task activates a sparse subset of experts through a differentiable matching process, guided by a novel mutual information-based loss. This modular structure avoids full backbone sharing and scales effectively with the number of tasks and dataset size. In this extended version, we generalize Mod-Squad to support multi-dataset pre-training, enabling joint learning across disjoint, single-task datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO, ADE20K). This is achieved via a new formulation of the mutual information loss that unifies learning across heterogeneous sources. More importantly, while most prior work in large models has focused on efficiency, few have explored adjustable efficiency. In this study, we further evaluate the model's generalization to downstream tasks and introduce a set of efficient adaptation techniques that leverage Mod-Squad's modularity for flexible finetuning-enabling dynamic adjustment of model size, parameter count, and computational cost. Additionally, we present a hybrid adaptation scheme that combines these techniques to achieve favorable performance-efficiency trade-offs. In summary, Mod-Squad provides a robust foundation for sparse modular models that can learn from diverse supervision and datasets. Its emergent modularity enables strong generalization, decomposition into high-performing components, and rapid, resource-efficient adaptation for downstream applications."

    "abstract": "The rapid electrification of transportation demands compact, high-power-density low-voltage electric machines (EMs), whose winding insulation life limits safety and uptime. Conventional Arrhenius models consider only thermal–chemical aging and often neglect thermal–mechanical (T-M) fatigue resulting from frequent temperature cycling in vehicle duty cycles. Based on mathematical derivation and previous physical models, this paper proposed a unified temperature-cycling life model that couples Arrhenius T-C terms with a phenomenological T-M fatigue term driven by cycle amplitude and mean temperature. The life model’s parameters are tuned using experimental data collected during accelerated temperature profiles (TPs) cycling tests performed on motorette specimens, while the life model is validated across different TPs. The predicted life outcomes demonstrate higher computational efficiency and yield more conservative results compared to the physical model simulations. As proof of concept, the proposed model is employed at the design stage of an EM meant for automotive application, in order to achieve a mission profile-based reliability-oriented design. Meanwhile, a real-time life consumption methodology, employing online cycle counting, is implemented to facilitate continuous reliability assessment and monitoring. This integrated approach establishes a systematic framework for evaluating and managing the reliability of EM insulation systems, thereby enhancing the methodological foundation for life prediction under realistic and dynamically varying operating conditions."

To address this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive robust fusion method for MIMU array designed for dynamic applications. The performance enhancement mechanism of MIMU array is analyzed and the theoretical basis of the reduced effectiveness of traditional noise estimation methods under dynamic conditions is investigated. A second-order redundant observation mechanism is introduced to enable reliable online noise estimation of MIMU array in dynamic environments. Building upon this estimation, a fading-memory factor and a similarity evaluation strategy are incorporated to achieve adaptive and robust fusion of multiple MIMU measurements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively estimate the noise level of MIMU array in dynamic scenarios, while vehicle experiments further verify its capability to enhance both accuracy and robustness in practical dynamic applications."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a five-level (5L) inverter that combines the benefits of the DC-DC boost converter and the common-ground-type (CGT) inverter in a single-stage conversion. On contrary to the majority of the established CGT inverters, the proposed topology features continuous input current (non-zero) with dynamic voltage-boosting gain. Additionally, the proposed inverter eliminates ground leakage current caused by photovoltaic parasitic capacitance because of the common ground feature. It requires lower voltage rating capacitors, i.e., half of the inverter’s peak output voltage, and is self-voltage-balanced, and reduced control complexity. It will be demonstrated that the voltage stress of semiconductor devices, the number of conducting switches, and switching transitions are the least, resulting in lower power losses. The circuit description and its operation are explained in detail. A comparative assessment is carried out to highlight the salient features of the proposed topology against its counterparts. From the comparative analysis, the above-mentioned salient features of the proposed topology will be established. The experiment results for grid-connected operation demonstrate the proposed inverter’s viability and feasibility. Furthermore, the proposed 5L CGT inverter has fault-tolerant capability unlike other recent CGT inverters; it can sustain the inverter operation in post-fault operation and is capable of supplying partial/full load power."

    "abstract": "AI-agent-based supply chains promise faster, more resilient, and sustainable operations, but outcomes depend on how autonomous agents are aligned with the business strategy of the company. In this research, centralised orchestration is considered as the governance layer that converts strategy into distributed agent behaviour. We consider decision-making rights and governance routines, shared planning calendars, and contracts tied to KPIs based on a literature review from 2020 to 2025, as well as a five-stage orchestration maturity model starting with isolated pilots and synchronisation to achieve ecosystem synchronisation. Three KPI bundles connect maturity with strategic performance: resilience (time-replan/recovery), agility (latency of decision), and sustainability (e.g., CO₂ intensity). Results show that organisations on the maturity path improve more consistently on these KPIs if orchestration includes shared data, synchronised horizons and contractual accountability. Meanwhile, locally optimised or misaligned agent deployments lead to performance compromises. Contributions include (i) an integrative framework, where orchestration mechanisms are connected to strategic-alignment pathways, and (ii) a diagnostic and roadmap maturity model. (iii) managerial guidelines for orchestration charters, integrated business planning cadences and KPI contracts. The study also sets out guidelines for exploring thresholds for \"human interaction\", data sharing/consent and designing incentives for autonomous execution aligned with strategy."

To address this challenge, my research focuses on discrimination testing as a means to ensure equitable behavior in software systems. As part of this effort, I plan to build on insights from my earlier work, which involved compiling a list of existing tools and user studies on their effectiveness.

In addition, a conceptual model for a data cleaning pipeline is proposed, comprising modules for edge processing, real-time stream ingestion, semantic and syntactic data transformation, and integration with time-series databases and visualization platforms. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of each tool in specific contexts, guiding data professionals when selecting appropriate solutions based on project requirements, data volume, and technical expertise.

Both 3D-printed antennas were analyzed through full-wave simulations. The first antenna used a 5 mm monolithic substrate, achieving a $2.83 \\%$ impedance bandwidth, a peak realized gain of 5.18 dBi, and stable broadside radiation patterns, offering greater mechanical simplicity than a conventional four-layer FR4 microstrip stack $(6 \\mathrm{~mm})$. The second antenna reduced the profile to 3 mm via a sandwich-style stacked patch, introducing an additional resonance that maintained bandwidth while limiting the peak gain to 2.9 dBi and preserving stable radiation patterns. Simulations confirmed that both antennas maintain stable hemispherical radiation patterns with effective impedance matching and low RF losses across the operational band. These results demonstrate that electroplated 3D-printed antennas provide ultra-low-profile, low-complexity alternatives to conventional multilayer microstrip designs for sub-GHz applications requiring moderate bandwidth enhancement."

Analyses were conducted on the BIG IDEAs Lab dataset comprising 16 participants, using leave-one-person-out cross-validation and personalized modeling strategies. In low-data personalized settings, XGBoost achieved superior accuracy (RMSE: 4.04 mg/dL), whereas generative models outperformed in the generalized leave-one-patient-out setting, achieving RMSE values down to 17.45 mg/dL. An integrated translation– forecasting pipeline combining a VAE encoder with an LSTM forecaster further attained an RMSE of 12.9 mg/dL in personalized evaluations. These findings demonstrate the promise of generative AI for clinical glucose monitoring while revealing important performance trade-offs between personalized and generalized approaches that must be addressed for real-world deployment."

This study rigorously evaluates the real-world performance of consumer-grade Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers under diverse urban conditions, including varying speeds, travel directions, and environmental factors within an urban canyon in Varna, Bulgaria. Our experimental findings reveal substantial and spatially consistent deviations from actual trajectories (mean error: 9.87 m; RMSE: 12.43 m for 3.6 km/h), coupled with frequent signal outages, particularly in areas characterized by dense infrastructure and tunnels. We demonstrate that GNSS accuracy is significantly degraded by multipath effects and signal blockages, with challenging zones exhibiting substantial spatial superposition. Furthermore, the study highlights distinct directional discrepancies in accuracy and nuanced impacts of speed. Critically, even advanced consumer sensors did not consistently outperform basic counterparts in these severely compromised conditions. GNSS positioning alone is unreliable in urban areas.

    "abstract": "Customer service operations increasingly struggle to handle the rising volume and complexity of support tickets, exposing the limitations of traditional rule-based workflows and static machine learning models that often lack contextual adaptability. This paper presents a modular architecture that integrates multi-agent systems orchestrated by large language models (LLMs), specifically G PT-4-mini, implemented through the CrewAI framework. The proposed system leverages specialized agents for data ingestion, ticket classification into categories such as incident, request, change, and problem, and the generation of contextually appropriate responses. Experimental evaluations conducted on a dataset of technical support tickets demonstrate an average classification accuracy of 85% and a mean cosine similarity of $\\mathbf{7 5 \\%}$—capturing semantic alignment beyond lexical overlap. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with multi-agent coordination to automate customer support workflows, offering a scalable foundation for deploying intelligent systems across diverse operational environments."

The proposed architecture integrates MATLAB for real-time dynamic computation and Autodesk Inventor through the implementation of IPC with a custom messaging protocol. The dynamics of the fingers are modeled using the Newton-Euler formulation. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical scheme with fifth-order local error estimation is employed to ensure temporal accuracy. The model includes mechanical constraints (angular stops) and inertial parameters obtained directly from the 3D geometry. The results show a consistent correspondence with the expected physical behavior, validating the simulation approach."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly transforming how complex electromechanical products are diagnosed, serviced, and maintained. However, their integration within the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase remains fragmented across design, manufacturing, and service domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of AI-driven diagnostics and predictive maintenance frameworks specifically applied in NPI Service Engineering. The study systematically reviews recent literature and industrial implementations to identify core techniques such as data-driven fault detection, digital twins, and physics-informed models, along with their roles in improving fault triage accuracy, mean time to repair (MTTR), and first-time fix rates (FTF). A structured taxonomy is developed to classify methods based on learning paradigms, data sources, and system hierarchy levels. Comparative analysis reveals that hybrid AI models-combining physical modeling with deep learning-offer the highest potential for early anomaly detection and cross-domain integration. Finally, the paper highlights research gaps in dataset standardization, model interpretability, and real-time deployment within field environments, offering a roadmap for future AI-augmented NPI ecosystems."

    "abstract": "This work presents a high-level control architecture for trajectory tracking in quadruped robots. The proposed controller is based on the motion kinematics of the robot’s center of mass (CoM). The proposed strategy transforms planned trajectories in Cartesian space into motion velocity commands for the robot, using a differential kinematic model that relates the velocity of the robot’s operational point to its velocity in the XY-plane. The control scheme is organized hierarchically, where the kinematic controller operates independently from the system dynamics, which are handled by low-level controllers. The proposed control architecture is experimentally validated using the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot, employing MATLAB and ROS2 tools. The results confirm the feasibility of using purely kinematic models for high-level locomotion task control under real-world operating conditions."

Such a campaign can cause instability in Indonesia’s growth. In this study, social network analysis is employed to identify key opinion leaders (KOLs) and communities within #IndonesiaGelap discourses on Twitter. Semantic coherence within each detected community is further examined using BERTopic. This study identifies political figures, government institutions, news outlet, and communitybased accounts as KOLs. However, none of the political figures and government institutions emerged as central or broker accounts. This study also detects $\\mathbf{6 4 5}$ communities with weak intra-connections. Analysis of the Top-10 most populated communities finds nine communities form no coherent topics. The one community with coherent topics is dominated by brokers with distilled narratives from the sub-community. This community exhibits a mesh network structure, suggesting interactions among them. However, the cosine coherence score of 0.6491 and NPMI coherence score of -0.599 suggest that more topics exist in the broker community. UMAP and HDSBCAN hyperparameter tuning in BERTopic are needed to reveal more coherent topics. As for the new government, this study reveals a communication gap that needs to be bridged to prevent further spread of #IndonesiaGelap discourse."

However, manual inspection remains a time-consuming process and is highly susceptible to human error. Although deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in plant disease identification, most existing studies have concentrated on leaf based analysis, leaving a research gap in fruit specific identification. This study proposes and evaluates a deep learning framework for the identification of apple fruit diseases using the InceptionV3 architecture optimized with the Adam algorithm. A dataset comprising 3,360 images was collected from apple orchards, representing five categories: Black Pox, Black Rot, Fruit Moth, Green Fruit Caterpillar, and Healthy. Data augmentation techniques were employed to mitigate class imbalance prior to training. The proposed InceptionV3 model was compared with EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Experimental results indicated that InceptionV3 achieved superior performance, attaining 97.15% testing accuracy with balanced Precision, Recall, and F1-Score values of 0.97. Despite its slower inference time, the model demonstrated high reliability for automated apple disease identification in practical agricultural applications."

This study examines how the performance of Ecuadorian universities in the QS World University Rankings from 2023 to 2026 is related to how significantly the government spends on higher education. The analysis examines at whether more public spending leads to better rankings by comparing national funding data from 2021 to 2025 with QS outcomes and taking into account methodological lag. Findings reveal that while investment peaks coincide with moderate gains in research related and sustainability indicators, broader improvements such as employer reputation or internationalization remain limited. Several public institutions exited the rankings in 2026 despite previous upward trends, suggesting structural or strategic misalignments. The results indicate that public funding, though essential, is insufficient in isolation. It is crucial for institutions to be in line with changing ranking metrics, such as sustainability and international research networks. The study indicates that national policies need to connect money spent with clear performance goals so that investments lead to long-term global visibility."

Cadmium (Cd) content was measured in both leaves and root tissues of $\\mathbf{Z}$. mays $\\mathbf{L}$., as well as in post-treatment soil.

The results indicated a higher presence of Cd in the roots $(3.5-5 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg})$ than in the leaves (up to $0.2-0.45 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$), while Cd in the soil reached minimum values of up to $2.3 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$. The application of EM 2 and 4% resulted in the highest $\\mathbf{C d}$ absorption values in the root and the lowest Cd concentration in the soil.

    "abstract": "The selective removal of ionic pollutants from wastewater represents a significant challenge in the advancement of scalable and efficient water purification technologies. This study explores the adsorption behavior of green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) toward anionic dyes, with particular emphasis on the role of the surface charge imparted by plant-derived capping agents. The AgNPs were synthesized using discarded yerba mate extract, which is rich in phenolic compounds and other oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) that act as both reducing and capping agents, conferring a predominantly negative surface charge to the nanoparticles. Experimental results revealed minimal interaction with anionic dyes, such as bromocresol green and congo red. In contrast, prior studies have shown that these AgNPs exhibit high adsorption efficiency towards cationic dyes, including crystal violet, methylene blue, and safranin. This selective adsorption behavior was attributed to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged nanoparticle surfaces and the anionic dye molecules. These findings demonstrate the critical influence of synthesis conditions and surface functionalization on the adsorption performance of nanoparticles. Moreover, they highlight the importance of tailoring nanoparticles surface properties to enhance selectivity and broaden the range of target pollutants. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the physicochemical characteristics that govern pollutantnanomaterial interactions, contributing to the advancement of sustainable and cost-effective nanotechnology-based solutions for environmental remediation"

Many studies have revealed that diaries, in addition to overcoming various dynamics of unstable social emotional competence problems, can also improve students’ academic performance. Researchers try to transform the usual diary with book and pen media into digital diary journals (DDJs). For this reason, this study is the basis for the development of application-based diaries. There are 117 elementary school students who are respondents in the study. Data were collected using a questionnaire, then processed and analyzed using the Pearson correlation test statistical method. This study presents a number of important statistical evidences in the development of DDJs including students being quite interested in writing digital-based diaries. Interestingly, students have not seen the application design directly, but students are already interested at a moderate level. In addition, there is a significant correlation between students’ perceptions and interests in the benefits of the DDJs application with the development of social emotional learning (SEL). In addition, students describe themselves as not very good at SEL, which indicates that the development of DDJs can be tried as a new strategy in improving students’ SEL."

Tractors used in agriculture are characterized by pollution, but biomethane and electric tractors are today considered conceptual, but not mass solutions. The perspective of farms to reduce pollution is related both to the optimization of the livestock sector and to additional activities in generating electricity. In the latter case, the emphasis is on the transformation of storage, drying, and production areas through the use of solar collectors and batteries. The article proposes solutions that allow for the cost-effective development of renewable energy activities on farms, reducing costs and environmental pollution. In addition, synergies are presented that allow for the improvement of the main activities carried out by farms, making them safer and generating higher income. The main idea of the article is the necessary integration between different technologies in order to minimize farm pollution while achieving maximum operational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Robust and reliable human–machine shared driving (HMSD) is essential for balancing safety and comfort. Within a connected urban arterial system, rare high-risk long-tail disturbances can trigger conflicts, lane departures, and oscillatory flow, degrading system safety and efficiency of the HMSD. To mitigate these effects, an interactive learning framework is built by coupling a scalable environment model with a dual-discriminator generative adversarial network to synthesise diverse, high-fidelity extreme scenarios, thereby enlarging the training domain of HMSD. A bidirectional loop between the environment model and the decision maker enables continuous refinement of the control policy, risk suppression, and improvement in response efficiency. The trained controller leverages cooperative vehicle–infrastructure sensing to derive shared risk states and to adaptively allocate authority between the human driver and automation in real time. The robustness of the proposed method is validated by comparing it with other shared control frameworks on a hierarchical validation platform, including a driver-in-the-loop (DiL) system. The results demonstrate that this method offers a superior balance between driving safety, stability, and pleasure, while demonstrating practical and robust control performance under long-tail events."

    "abstract": "Estimating the reachable set of a dynamical system is a fundamental problem in control theory, particularly when control inputs are bounded. Direct simulation using randomly sampled admissible controls often leads to trajectories that cluster near attractors, resulting in poor coverage of the reachable set. To achieve a more uniform distribution of terminal states, we formulate the problem within an Optimal Transport (OT) framework. In this setting, the goal is to steer the system so that the final state distribution, determined by the chosen controls and initial conditions, matches a desired target distribution. Enforcing this condition exactly is not possible since the reachable set is not known. So we introduce an L2-norm based regularization of the terminal distribution that relaxes the constraint while promoting uniform coverage. The resulting formulation can be approximated by a finite-dimensional, particle-based optimal control problem with kernel-coupled terminal cost. We show that this approach converges to the original formulation and demonstrate through a 2D and 6D numerical example that it provides significantly more uniform reachable-set sampling than random control strategies."

    "abstract": "Fuzzy private set intersection (fuzzy PSI) is a cryptographic protocol that enables privacy-preserving similarity matching, where a client securely learns which of its items are sufficiently close to some item in the service provider’s dataset. This functionality is essential for various real-world applications including biometric authentication, information retrieval, or recommendation systems. However, existing fuzzy PSI protocols suffer from two major barriers to deployment. First, many cannot handle high-dimensional feature vectors, e.g., from 128 to 512, in practical applications because of their exponential computation/communication overheads in dimension. Furthermore, existing protocols supporting <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> distance cannot accommodate cosine similarity.We found that their distributional assumptions on the data enforce overly strict similarity matching thresholds for the application, leading to prohibitively large false negatives. In this paper, we present FPHC, the first fuzzy PSI protocol that efficiently handles high-dimensional data with cosine similarity. FPHC features linear complexity on both computation and communication with respect to the dimension of set elements. We leverage CKKS, a homomorphic encryption scheme supporting approximate real-valued arithmetic, to compute similarity scores and threshold comparison, along with a clever packing method for efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a novel proof technique to harmonize the approximation error from the sign function with the noise flooding, proving the security of FPHC under the semi-honest model. Finally, we extend our FPHC to functionalities such as labeled or circuit fuzzy PSI. Through experiments, we demonstrate that FPHC can perform fuzzy PSI over 512-dimensional data in a few minutes, which was computationally infeasible in other previous fuzzy PSI proposals."

    "abstract": "This letter proposes a self-packaged wideband filtering 3dB branch-line coupler (BLC) with high selectivity, utilizing metal rectangular coaxial line (RCL). The design incorporates a novel short-circuit coupled line structure, combining short- and open-circuit coupled lines in a vertical configuration between the square loop and ports, which enhances bandwidth and introduces five transmission zeros (TZs) to improve selectivity. Theoretical and numerical analyses confirm the design's effectiveness. A prototype operating at 5.8 GHz demonstrates a fractional bandwidth of 43.6% (4.72–7.25 GHz), with amplitude imbalance under 0.5 dB, return loss and isolation exceeding 15 dB, and phase imbalance of ±4°. The experimental results align closely with simulations, validating the design's performance."

    "abstract": "Neural operators, such as graph neural operators (GNOs) and Fourier neural operators (FNOs), directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution and have achieved remarkable progress in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). GNOs exhibit excellent interpretability, as they construct graph models of physical fields to mine the mutual relationships between different nodes. However, existing methods are unable to mine the deep-level graph node features, which leads to insufficient information from neighboring nodes during the graph information aggregation process, ultimately resulting in a decline in solution accuracy. This article proposes a space–frequency cross-attention (CA) node feature optimization GNO (NFO-GNO) to address this issue. Considering the multiscale nature of the PDEs, we first construct a multiscale graph building module to obtain the PDEs information at different scales by processing graphs of different scales. After obtaining the multiscale graph models, we use a node feature optimization network (NFON) to extract and optimize the node features of the graphs in the spatial and frequency domains, and utilize CA to fuse them, thereby obtaining deep-level graph node features. Finally, we use a GNO to solve the optimized node features. NFO-GNO achieves superior solving performance compared to the baselines on four standard benchmarks covering both solid mechanics and fluid dynamics simulations. Notably, NFO-GNO maintains better performance with limited training samples and low-resolution training data, reducing data requirements and making it more adaptable to scenarios where high-quality datasets are difficult to obtain."

    "abstract": "Voice data is crucial for modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, powering various applications from speaker recognition (SR) to AI-generated content. The reliance on massive data raises serious concerns about privacy and property rights due to potential unauthorized misuse. Unfortunately, no effective method has been proposed to protect the privacy and copyright of voice data while meeting perceptual audio quality requirements. To bridge this gap, we introduce Volto, a unified dual-function framework for generating unlearnable yet traceable voice examples. Volto jointly integrates unlearnable perturbations and learnable watermarks, exploiting weaknesses in both human auditory perception and deep neural network (DNN) representations. This synergistic design enables Volto to corrupt critical model-sensitive features, hindering unauthorized model learning, while encoding watermark signals that remain recoverable for ownership verification. The unlearnable examples can confuse DNNs while preserving the perceptual quality, reducing the accuracy of unauthorized models by more than 21.44% in black-box scenarios. Volto also introduces a verifiable watermark, providing robust evidence of data ownership. Our work effectively balances protection effectiveness and usability, offering an effective defense for voice privacy."

    "abstract": "The misalignment between the external risks a company faces, such as natural disasters or macroeconomic shocks, and the supply chain risk mitigation efforts it undertakes has received limited attention, particularly from the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using contingency theory as a theoretical underpinning, this research introduces a novel fit measure, the risk mitigation deficit (RMD), to capture this misalignment. It then examines the impact of RMD on operational risk (OR), which refers to the failure of the supply chain to achieve key objectives such as cost efficiency, quality, and sustainability. SMEs face unique challenges, as risk mitigation efforts are resource-intensive, requiring careful alignment of mitigation measures with risk exposure. This study contributes by analyzing data from 213 SMEs in the Spanish agri-food supply chain. The results suggest that both upstream and in-house RMD positively influence output OR, while downstream RMD shows no such relationship. Similarly, upstream RMD does not appear to influence input OR. A robustness test examining the effect of mere risk mitigation effort (RME) on OR confirmed that RMD possesses explanatory power over OR that RME alone does not. These findings underscore that a one-size-fits-all approach to supply chain risk management (SCRM) is ineffective, especially for resource-constrained SMEs. Instead, tailored, context-specific solutions are needed to help SMEs efficiently balance risk profiles and mitigation efforts."

Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets or synthetic data, resulting in limited generalization performance when confronted with data scarcity or cross-domain distribution differences. To tackle this challenge, we propose a lightweight geometry-guided category-level pose and size estimation method based on self-supervised learning, without utilizing real-world label information. Specifically, to enhance the geometric correlations between the negative samples, we develop parameter-inverse transformations and integrate it into the sample generation process to facilitate robust consistent learning. Concurrently, we incorporate the geometric constraints loss into the network optimization process to further improve the performance of the transformations. Then, we propose gated geometric feature fusion module and symmetry-aware deformable feature fusion module from the perspective of the geometric feature differences, thereby forming a hierarchical deformable modeling with complementary local-to-global characteristics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on REAL275 and Wild6D to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Moreover, we apply the proposed method to the grasping task utilizing the Aubo robotic arm. The proposed method also achieves remarkable performance in the real-world experiments."

This study presents a novel hybrid security framework Lorenz-Rössler-Elliptic Curve Cryptography (LRE) that integrates with an innovative XOR-Matrix-based encoding steganography technique to enhance data security in interconnected IoT devices. LRE encrypts sensitive data from IoT devices, ensuring strong cryptographic protection, while the encrypted data is concealed within images using the steganographic method for improved data concealment. An Adaptive Firefly Optimization technique is employed to select optimal embedding blocks in the image, thereby maximizing embedding efficiency and security. Additionally, we propose an authentication protocol that enables IoT device authentication before data exchange in IoT networks. The proposed protocol ensures secure communication between IoT devices using lightweight session keys and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), ensuring low computational overhead. It employs implicit key-based authentication with global IDs and nonces to enable efficient mutual authentication and prevent security breaches. The framework's performance is rigorously evaluated using various metrics and compared with existing approaches, showcasing superior encryption strength, embedding robustness, and computational efficiency. The proposed protocol also ensures secure and reliable IoT communication by resisting DoS, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks through efficient authentication and session key management. Precise data extraction and decryption further validate the framework's reliability for secure data transmission. By addressing key vulnerabilities and introducing an advanced optimization-based steganographic approach, this hybrid framework offers a scalable and effective solution to enhance data security in resource-constrained IoT environments."

    "abstract": "Radar-based machine learning pipelines require extensive annotated datasets. However, producing large volumes of precise labels remains prohibitively laborious and prone to inconsistency, as radar signals lack a direct visual correspondence. To address this limitation, we introduce a fully automated, multi-modal annotation pipeline built around our custom <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RadarBox</i> that co-registers a FMCW MIMO radar with an Azure Kinect RGB-D camera. Precise spatial calibration and hardware-level synchronization yield exact pixel-to-radar alignment. RGB images undergo panoptic segmentation to generate per-pixel human masks, which are fused with depth measurements to reconstruct a voxelized surface mesh. We extract 3D joint positions from the Kinect Body Tracking SDK and apply a bidirectional Kalman filter to derive precise per-joint positions and velocity vectors free from sudden, non-physiological fluctuations. These enhanced labels are projected into 5D radar cube slices and target lists through robust spatio-temporal association. As a demonstration, we train a deep neural network on annotated radar target lists for indoor people localization, achieving a mean positional error of 0.31 m and 91.8% occupancy accuracy, even under occlusion. Unlike prior semi-automatic or heuristic-based methods, our approach delivers consistent 5D labels at scale, bridging spatial, temporal, and Doppler dimensions, and thus paves the way for large-scale, learning-based radar sensing in human-centered applications."

This pa per revisits the mathematical foundation of CHP and provides an explicit formulation of the Lagrangian dual formulation for network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC), further defining the CHP. Here, a convex hull model for single-unit commitment (1UC) problems is established with ramping constraints and minimum on/off time, making this explicit formulation implementable and further delivering the optimal Lagrangian dual solution via two linear programming (LP) models. The first LP reformulates the NCUC by replacing mixed-integer constraints with convex hull relaxations, while the second, obtained by fixing the inner variables in the Lagrangian dual problem of the NCUC to their optimal val ues from the first LP, generates the optimal Lagrangian dual solution. Numerical experiments on the IEEE-118 and Polish-2383 sys tems validate the superiority of CHP in reducing uplift costs and of this proposed pricing method in computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "In beyond 5G (B5G) wireless communication, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) have been projected as two promising key technologies for vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper considers a RIS-aided V2V network model employing power-domain (PD) NOMA. The scenario focuses on a deep-fade dense urban environment, where no line-of-sight (NLoS) path is available for direct communication between the vehicles. Due to the mobile nature of the vehicles, imperfect channel state information (CSI) has been considered in this work. Two communicating RIS, one located near the transmitting vehicle and another near the receiver vehicle, have been used in the system model. To assess the performance of the proposed model, the closed-form expressions of the outage probability, ergodic capacity and energy efficiency have been derived. To obtain further insights, the number of RIS elements is varied to obtain the impact of spatial diversity on each parameter. The obtained simulation results are further compared with the traditional Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and pre-existing literature work for benchmark comparison. The result suggests that RIS-aided NOMA networks can perform better in V2V wireless communication and can be suitable in B5G-V2V radio networks."

The relationship between the molecular structure of epoxy resins and their resistance to electrical treeing remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates the electrical treeing resistance of four commercially available epoxy resins with distinct molecular architectures under high-frequency (10 kHz) and high-temperature (90 °C) conditions. Through isothermal surface potential decay (ISPD) tests and quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the mechanism of electrical treeing inhibition from microscopic perspectives of electron cloud polarization and trap distribution characteristics. Results demonstrate that densely distributed shallow traps in epoxy resins promote bush-like electrical tree growth patterns, homogenizing internal electric field and effectively suppressing tree propagation. This work establishes a theoretical framework for designing and evaluating insulation materials in high-frequency/high-temperature power electronic systems."

    "abstract": "Neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have become increasingly popular in intelligent IoT applications. However, their widespread deployment is often limited by the storage and computational constraints of sensors or edge devices in these environments. Pruning is a well-established and effective technique for compressing CNNs, known for its simplicity, usability, and efficiency. Traditionally, pruning is assumed to reduce model accuracy and requires manual setting of pruning ratios, which can be time-consuming and imprecise. In this paper, we challenge these assumptions by presenting a novel perspective on pruning. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions, pruning can actually improve network accuracy by eliminating redundant filters that could contribute to overfitting. To optimize pruning for accuracy, we introduce a new metric, the Filter Change Rate (FCR), designed to identify the optimal pruning ratio. Furthermore, we propose the Golden Ratio, an efficient binary search-based algorithm for quickly determining this optimal ratio, eliminating the need for manual tuning. Our extensive experiments show that our pruning method enables neural networks to achieve higher accuracy, even with a smaller network size."

    "abstract": "Emotion cause extraction (ECE) is vital in understanding the triggers of emotions portrayed in text, thereby enriching user interaction and relatability. Traditional methods such as rule-based and lexical matching struggle due to the paucity of lexical similarity between causes and emotions. While machine learning and deep learning have improved by modeling sequential dependencies and multilevel representations, they still fall short in handling long-distance dependencies and interclause interactions. Attention-based techniques have demonstrated efficacy in refining semantic context over longer text spans, but they frequently suffer from scalability issues for moderate-sized datasets. To tackle the aforementioned shortcomings, we propose a novel model incorporating inter and intraclause relationships, improving the identification of causes behind emotions. Our approach aims to capture fine-grained interactions within the clause (intra) using a dual-attention mechanism involving both cross- and self-attention on multisource features. This addresses scalability by incorporating numerical features as auxiliary information. To capture the dependencies between clauses (inter), we employ a contrastive learning approach to group relevant clauses together in feature space. This helps address long-distance dependency issues both within and between clauses. Through extensive experimentation on the RECCON benchmark dataset, we depict the effectiveness of our strategy in increasing the F1-score of the ECE task by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$20{-}25$</tex-math></inline-formula>%.

This study investigates the impact of EV integration on a university campus located in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia, serving as a micro-scale case study within the Dominion Energy service territory. Using recently reported EV registration data, coupled with available campus parking and charging infrastructure information, baseline uncontrolled charging was compared with smart charging (V1G) and bidirectional vehicle-to-grid (V2G) strategies. The results demonstrate that uncontrolled charging could significantly exacerbate evening peak demand, while controlled charging strategies substantially mitigate these peaks and reduce ramping requirements. Furthermore, V2G integration, particularly through emerging electric school bus fleets in Virginia, has the potential to provide critical support during summer peak events and emergency outage conditions, thereby enhancing campus resilience. This study contributes to the literature on EV–grid interactions by presenting one of the first campus-level case studies in the Hampton Roads region. The findings highlight both the technical feasibility and the policy relevance of EV-based flexibility solutions, offering practical insights for universities, utilities, and policymakers in Virginia. Additionally, scaling analytics to the regional level provides a foundation for aligning campus-level insights with statewide clean energy and decarbonization goals."

In this study, we introduce Dark Pattern Detector, a Chrome extension that would help users detect and understand dark patterns online. We conducted a technology probe study where participants $(n=40)$ were tasked with installing the extension and completing a series of tasks on different websites based on real-world Internet browsing. We leveraged mixed-methods surveys to collect feedback on dark pattern detection tools in practice. We found the majority of participants gave positive feedback, claiming they found the extension useful, interesting, and a good idea. Many participants also gave useful feedback about what changes or additions they would like to see in future systems.

We present our approach on studying UxU device to device communications on extremely challenging channel environments that dictate full-wave analysis and the computation of Sommerfeld integrals. Specifically, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the over-sea water to under-sea water drone communication scenario is studied under 5G Sidelink.

Through an electronics toolkit with a natural language interface, users will be able to program interactive objects by describing their desired behavior effortlessly and learn from the generated code. The findings will contribute to understanding key HCI issues in lowering the barrier to tangibles for large audiences and let them create interactive experiences, free from technical constraints."

    "abstract": "Web APIs are essential in modern software systems, with OpenAPI as the standard specification for describing RESTful APIs. Despite widespread adoption, OpenAPI specifications are mainly textual documents that become verbose, deeply nested, and difficult to navigate at scale. Current tools like Swagger Editor lack graphical design capabilities, impeding effective prototyping for large teams and non-technical users. To address this gap, we present APICAnvas, a visual design tool enabling users to interact with OpenAPI specifications through both editable YAML and graphical interfaces with bidirectional synchronization. We evaluated the tool with 13 participants across two tasks: creating new APIs and modifying existing ones. Results show 83% successfully created APIs from scratch and 75% correctly updated existing APIs, demonstrating the tool’s effectiveness across diverse experience levels."

    "abstract": "This study focused on analyzing the response of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to the application of different digital filters. EEG signals (14 electrodes) were recorded at rest, with no external stimuli present. The EEG recordings were subdivided into four sub-bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta. The analysis was performed in the time domain, focusing on signal amplitude, frequency, and morphology.The EEG signals were represented through their frequency distribution and modeled as curves with a normal probability distribution. Convolution operations were performed between pairs of digital filters over these distributions to identify which filters exhibited lower temporal variability.The results of the comparative analysis revealed that the filters induced variable responses. In the Delta band, the sym9 filter showed greater selectivity and stronger presence across electrodes. For the Theta band, the db1 filter presented the lowest variability across all electrodes. In the Alpha and Beta bands, the db2 filter showed both lower variability and stronger signal presence.This study demonstrates that the response of EEG signals to different digital filters can lead to variations in the resulting signal characteristics. Although the differences are subtle, taking them into account could contribute to more objective results in EEG signal processing."

    "abstract": "Protective relaying is the backbone of electrical power distribution systems. As compared to traditional electromechanical relays, modern microprocessor-based relays can perform a multitude of protective functions. Recently, a Southern California cement plant discovered the benefits of implementing virtual main protection on the secondary of a 1 MVA 4.16kV/480V transformer to greatly reduce arc flash (AF) incident energy (IE) levels at the associated downstream low voltage Motor Control Center (MCC).Another benefit of modern relaying is the ability to replace hard-wired tripping signals from switchgear in isolated unit substations to the lockout relays located in the associated upstream switchgear feeder breakers using Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging between the relays. This integrates the old and the new electrical infrastructures and makes the overall protection more robust and reliable.This paper will discuss the benefits of implementing smart relaying, specifically for the above-mentioned applications within cement plants."

This paper presents a privacy-preserving FL framework deployed on a wireless ad hoc edge network of lowcost Raspberry Pi devices. A minimal Bash script automates the configuration of the MANET topology, ensuring scalability and resilience across embedded nodes. We implemented a lightweight TCP message protocol to transmit model parameters and control signals, keeping local datasets private throughout. To validate the framework, we employed the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset-chosen for its complexity and imbalance-though the approach generalizes to other tabular problems. We systematically evaluated four aggregation methods (FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova, and FedAvgM) under both IID and non-IID partitions, and compared them to a centralized baseline trained on the entire combined dataset collected from all clients in one place. Results show that while FedNova excelled under balanced conditions, FedAvgM was more robust to heterogeneous client distributions. These findings highlight the practicality of deploying federated neural networks on infrastructure-free edge environments, achieving competitive performance without sharing sensitive raw data."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning method that identifies patterns in unlabeled data by grouping similar observations. The primary goal is to map data based on inherent characteristics using clustering techniques. To determine the optimal number of clusters, evaluation metrics such as the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) are commonly used. A good clustering result is achieved when within-group variation is minimal and between-group variation is large. However, these metrics often yield inconsistent results, leading to potential bias in deciding the ideal cluster number. This study aims to evaluate which metric performs best using a power test. The dataset used is time-series data with 38 observations and 487 features, clustered across six datasets with identical dimensions. Clustering experiments were conducted with 2 to 10 clusters, and metrics were calculated for each configuration. Analysis revealed discrepancies among the three indices, where Silhouette suggested 2 clusters, DBI 10 clusters, and CHI 8 clusters. A power test on this case showed that the DBI achieved a 90% performance rate, outperforming the Silhouette and CHI metrics in determining the optimal number of clusters."

The study uses a drought dataset sourced from Kaggle, spanning from 2000 to 2016, to predict drought conditions across U.S. counties. Unlike traditional static learning, where models are retrained from scratch, continual learning allows the model to update incrementally with new data, preserving prior knowledge and adapting to evolving data distributions. The performance of the continual learning approach is evaluated using ROC AUC, which measures the model’s ability to differentiate between drought and nondrought conditions. The results show that continual learning outperforms static learning in $71 \\%$ of the iterations, with an average ROC AUC score of $65.0 \\%$, compared to $60.5 \\%$ for static learning. Additionally, continual learning demonstrates significant advantages in terms of memory consumption and training time, processing only new data while avoiding the need for full retraining. This study highlights the potential of continual learning as a more efficient and scalable solution for real-time predictions in dynamic environments, such as drought forecasting. The findings suggest that continual learning, even without deep learning models, can provide a viable alternative for time-series forecasting tasks that require model adaptation over time."

The analysis reveals that incidents are not evenly distributed and are closely linked to the local socio-economic conditions. Unlike conventional global regression models, GWR effectively captures spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between predictor variables and crime occurrences. The number of police posts demonstrates a consistently positive impact across most regions, whereas the open unemployment rate shows significant effects only in selected districts. The model exhibits strong performance, indicated by an R -squared value of 0.806 and a relatively low Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) compare to others. Additionally, the lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value suggests better model efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating local characteristics when designing more targeted and effective public safety policies."

The model leverages BLE to provide energy-efficient, real-time data transmission, while HyperLedger Fabric enables immutable and permissioned storage, smart contract-based automation and controlled data access for stakeholders such as safety managers, medical staff and insurers. A two-channel topology is introduced to optimize data handling by separating early-warning threshold events from detailed emergency medical records, thereby reducing unnecessary storage of sensitive information.

Post-training quantization (PTQ), network pruning, and architectural refinements are employed to reduce computational cost, accelerate inference, and optimize hardware resource utilization.

In this context, robotic machining has emerged as a leading alternative due to its flexibility, adaptability, and precision. This study presents the mechatronic design of a tool coupling system for milling and drilling applications using the KUKA KR 16 robot. The proposed design compares two coupling configurations: one mounted perpendicularly to the robot’s flange, and the other inclined at 45 degrees. The evaluation includes an analysis of cutting forces during the machining of expanded polystyrene (EPS), along with the corresponding bending moments and structural deformations. Additionally, a kinematic analysis of various machining processes is conducted to assess the standard deviation and angular variation range of the robot’s joints during operation. The results demonstrate that the deformations and bending moments experienced by both couplings do not compromise the structural integrity of the robotic system. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the perpendicular coupling offers superior performance for horizontal surface machining, while the 45-degree inclined design is better suited for inclined surface operations."

Experiments compare QRNs with pseudorandom numbers (PRNs), showing that although the final metrics are similar, QRNs consistently yield faster convergence. In the EBP-EAB model, QRNs reduced the number of iterations needed to reach the optimal error. In feature selection, QRNs reduced the generations required to achieve high-quality subsets without compromising accuracy. These results suggest that QRNs enhance convergence efficiency, positioning hybrid quantum-classical computing as a practical strategy for complex optimization in structural engineering and machine learning."

We analyzed the proposed system under different types of modulation and for various values of the polar code parameters: block-length N and dimension K. The simulation results show that if the rate R of the polar code has a value that is closer to 0, the Alamouti-polar configuration exhibits a lower bit error rate (BER), in comparison to the standalone Alamouti and polar code. The system is more robust in the case of binary phase shift keying (BPSK), and the worst scenario is found with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM)."

    "abstract": "Bioremediation with microalgae has been limited due to the difficulty of separating the substrates on which they are cultured, owing to their small size and high cost. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the actual efficiency of immobilized microalgal cultures for the bioremediation of effluents from a shrimp farm, and to assess their growth within a sodium alginate polymer matrix or luffa support.In the first experimental phase, a halotolerance test was conducted over two weeks to verify the adaptability of the Chlorella sp. strain to the experimental conditions used in later stages. A final cell density of $4.8 \\times 10^{6}$ cells $\\mathbf{~ m L}^{-1}$ was obtained.Batch experiments were conducted for ten days under photoperiod conditions $(12 / 12 \\mathrm{~h})$ and constant aeration $(43 \\mathrm{~mL}$ min $^{-1}$), using the following treatments: Chlorella sp. immobilized in sodium alginate spheres, Chlorella sp. immobilized in luffa, Chlorella sp. in suspension, and untreated wastewater as a control.

    "abstract": "Mangrove forests are critical ecosystems for global climate mitigation and coastal resilience. However, global and regional assessments of their health and recovery are often based on binary metrics of areal extent (presence/absence). This approach can be misleading, as it overlooks crucial structural changes, such as canopy densification, which are fundamental to ecosystem function. Consequently, the true efficacy of large-scale conservation efforts and the actual recovery of ecosystem services may be significantly misjudged. To address this limitation, we developed a novel framework integrating time-series Landsat (1990-2023), very-high-resolution, and UAV imagery to generate the first national-scale, 30 m resolution China Mangrove Cover Fraction (CMCF) dataset. Our analysis reveals a profound structural transformation: the national mean mangrove cover fraction (MCF) increased from 47% in 1990 to 70% in 2023. This structural enhancement, not just areal expansion, was a primary driver for a marked improvement in ecosystem services, with the national average coastal defense capacity increasing to 2.38 times its 1990 level by 2023. Furthermore, we document a significant northward migration of the MCF-weighted centroid, signaling large-scale biogeographical shifts in response to intensive management and environmental change. By moving beyond binary classifications, we provide robust, quantitative evidence that structural densification is a key determinant of the functional recovery of a major coastal ecosystem. These findings provide a more nuanced and accurate framework for evaluating large-scale conservation initiatives, offering critical evidence to advance the quantification of ecosystem services and guide more effective coastal environmental management."

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-colluding replay node that retransmits ambient radio frequency (RF) signals with randomized power, significantly increasing channel uncertainty faced by an adversarial warden (Willie) while preserving compatibility with low-power AmBC architectures. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that this approach enables linear scaling of covert throughput without necessitating power reduction or prior knowledge of ambient RF signal characteristics. Furthermore, it guarantees that Willie’s total detection error probability can be driven arbitrarily close to 1, specifically <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FA</sub> + <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MD</sub> = 1 − ϵ for any ϵ > 0, simultaneously achieving an arbitrarily low decoding error probability at the legitimate receiver (Bob).

By increasing the ambient signal power uncertainty, the proposed architecture provides a robust, scalable framework suitable for high-rate covert communication scenarios in IoT and privacy-sensitive applications, achieving an effective balance among covertness, energy efficiency, and system robustness."

    "abstract": "In the post-Moore era, heterogeneous integrated systems—such as chiplet-based designs—exhibit increasingly complex functional interface interconnections, demanding scalable and accurate verification methods. Traditional manual approaches are time-consuming and error-prone, while mainstream EDA tools lack standardized cross-level models and comprehensive multi-level rule checking. To address these limitations, we propose an automated verification mechanism based on an Attribute Recursive Hypergraph (ARH). The method constructs a five-layer hierarchical mapping network (component → interface → signal cluster → signal → pad) to represent architecture-to-schematic relationships. Verification proceeds in two stages. First, a Fault-Tolerant Bus Resolver (FT-Bus Resolver) applies matrix operations to extract interface structures from pad-netlists and generates a multi-level hypergraph. These structures are compared with system architecture for consistency. Second, a hierarchical rule base, executed by a Rule Executor, validates electrical compatibility and bus-topology constraints across abstraction levels. The implementation integrates a reusable component model library, recursive hypergraph representations, and a rule execution framework, which bridges semantic gaps and supports complex constraint checking. Experiments demonstrate full coverage and 100% correctness for 54 interface-level rules, compared with only one rule supported by commercial EDA tools. Across 7,350 connections and 6,500 injected errors, the framework eliminates all false positives, reduces missed errors by 63%, achieves 1,125×/1,034× speedups for consistency and rule checking, and exhibits near-linear memory growth for scalable deployment. Together, these results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism offers a scalable, robust, and high-coverage solution for cross-level verification in emerging heterogeneous and chiplet-based systems."

    "abstract": "The superposition of the primary field in time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) surveys can severely degrade data quality, especially during the early stage after the transmitting current is turned off, resulting in shallow detection blind spots. To address this problem, this paper proposes a cm-level coil–based method for equivalent measurement and removal of the primary field. By driving the cm-level coil with a proportionally reduced current, an equivalent primary field is generated while the induced secondary field remains negligible. The receiving system directly measures this equivalent primary field, enabling its subtraction from the observational data. The method was validated through field experiments using 4 m × 4 m and 50 m × 50 m transmitting coils, where residual primary fields from the bucking device and the complete primary field of the large loop were effectively removed. Consequently, the effective observation window was extended by 150 μs and 278 μs, respectively. The method significantly enhances shallow detection capability and exhibits broad applicability across TDEM system scales."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have become one of the core technologies for next-generation wireless networks. However, in multi-UAV collaborative scenarios, the problem of jointly optimizing trajectory planning and resource allocation for energy management, makespan minimization, and load balancing is inherently a complex mixed- integer nonlinear programming problem. Existing methods fail to strike an effective balance between solution quality, computational efficiency, and scalability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical optimization-based multi-UAV collaborative ISAC framework (HO-ISAC), which facilitates efficient multi-UAV collaboration via a two-stage mechanism: offline global trajectory planning and online flight control integrated with resource allocation. In the offline trajectory planning phase, multi-UAV trajectory coordination optimization is achieved through the integration of k-means clustering, simulated annealing, 2-OPT local optimization, and adaptive large neighborhood search techniques. In the online phase, dynamic adjustment of sensing and communication resources is realized through discretized parameter space search. Experimental results demonstrate that HO-ISAC significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in key metrics such as makespan, total energy consumption, and service fairness, while exhibiting excellent scalability and high solving efficiency."

Precise optical alignment was performed to optimize the system performance, ensuring improved spatial resolution and depth of field by matching the numerical apertures of the microlens array and the tube lens. The system achieved a spatial resolution of 12.4 μm, with contrast ratios of 90% and 97% in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Additionally, the depth of field was enhanced by 1.6 times, increasing from the theoretical value of 630 μm to 1000 μm. The analysis revealed that high-frequency components were more sensitive to variations in the depth of field relative to the spatial frequency, whereas low-frequency components maintained high clarity over an extended range."

A long-term sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the active beamforming at each access point (AP) and the passive beamforming at each STAR-RIS while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirements. To address this non-convex problem with challenges caused by user mobility and high-dimensional optimization variables, two deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based beamforming algorithms are proposed. Firstly, a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based centralized joint beamforming algorithm is proposed, which adds maximum entropy term to the objective function and provides an exceptional exploration-exploitation trade-off. However, since the centralized scheme might suffer from high communication loads and latency, we generalize the proposed approach into a distributed control. A multi-agent SAC (MASAC)-based distributed beamforming algorithm is further proposed, which employs the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, where each AP plays a role of an agent and makes decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The multiple STAR-RISs can effectively improve the performance of the CF mMIMO networks compared to other baseline schemes; 2) Both SAC-based and MASAC-based beamforming algorithms can maximize the sum-rate and guarantee the QoS of users in the long term; and 3) The MASAC-based beamforming algorithm performs better and converges faster than the SAC-based beamforming algorithm as it reduces the overall complexity and alleviates pressure on the fronthaul link transmission by making decentralized decisions."

This paper introduces an advanced cybersecurity framework aimed at safeguarding IEC 61850-based substations through the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) and digital twin (DT) technologies. The proposed DT-based framework employs smart cyber switching (SCS) for proactive threat mitigation and concurrent intelligent electronic device (CIED) for swift system restoration, thereby maintaining continuous operational integrity and robust cybersecurity defenses. Central to this framework is the adaptive port controller (APC), which enables dynamic port management to adapt to evolving threats, and an intrusion detection system (IDS) designed to detect and neutralize malicious attacks on IEC 61850-based sampled value (SV) and generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) messages within the substation’s communication network. Further, novel predictive intrusion detection and response (PIDR) algorithm is implemented on a digital substation (DS) to predict the best route to be taken by the attacker. The efficacy of these comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks is validated through rigorous simulations and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed, showcasing the system’s ability to sustain substation operations amidst cyber-attacks."

    "abstract": "Accurate boundary segmentation of anatomically complex structures such as organs and tumors remains a major challenge in medical image analysis. Traditional segmentation methods often overlook the extraction of high-frequency information such as texture and boundary details, despite their critical importance in guiding clinical surgical planning. To address this issue, we proposed a hierarchical frequency-domain enhancement strategy in the encoder, which performs effective separation and reconstruction of high- and low-frequency features via Fourier transform combined with a low-pass masking operation. This design enhances the model’s sensitivity to high-frequency texture and fine-grained boundary signals. Furthermore, in the decoder, we introduce a boundary refinement mechanism that dynamically combines Scharr operators with Laplacian-based sharpening to enhance structural clarity. This effectively alleviates segmentation discontinuities and boundary fragmentation issues commonly observed in regions with blurred edges using conventional methods. We conduct extensive experiments on both the BraTS 2020 MRI dataset and the Synapse CT dataset. Our method achieves an average Dice score of 86.79% on BraTS 2020 and 84.23% on Synapse, representing relative improvements of 0.99% and 0.90%, respectively, over strong state-of-the-art baselines. In terms of boundary precision, our approach reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) by 13.2% on BraTS 2020 and 30.1% on Synapse, demonstrating superior boundary segmentation capability.

However, researchers often struggle with inconsistencies in documentation, missing dependencies, and environment setup, which undermines the credibility of scientific results. To address this, we propose a conversational, text-based tool that aids researchers in reproducing and packaging computational experiments into a single file. This file can be re-executed with a double-click on any machine, requiring only a single tool. SciConv is designed to support two key scenarios: (i) enabling researchers to prepare their own experiments in a reproducible, shareable format, and (ii) helping other researchers reproduce existing experiments from shared code repositories. In both cases, the tool reduces technical overhead and simplifies environment configuration through conversational interaction. We evaluated the tool through two studies. In the first, we reproduced 15 of 18 published experiments, with most requiring little or no user interaction. In the second, we conducted a user study comparing our tool with a professional platform, using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA Task Load Index (TLX). The results show a statistically significant advantage for our tool in both usability and workload, demonstrating its effectiveness in supporting reproducibility."

The empirical results indicate that the GJR-GARCH (1,1,1) approach achieved the best overall forecasting accuracy, exhibiting the lowest RMSE and MAE values and the highest explanatory power (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.205). Among the deep learning models, the LSTM and BiLSTM architectures produced comparable absolute error magnitudes but exhibited weaker variance explanation, reflected in negative R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values. Descriptive statistics revealed heavy tails, negative skewness, and strong volatility clustering in the BIST 100 return series, validating the use of ARCH-type models. Overall, the findings suggest that while GARCH-family models remain superior for capturing asymmetric and time-varying volatility in emerging markets, deep learning models provide a flexible, data-driven complement. Future research may benefit from hybrid frameworks that combine the interpretability of econometric models with the representational strength of neural architectures to enhance volatility prediction and risk assessment in financial markets."

From a sample of 380 individuals, urban travel patterns were identified through the analysis of trip micro-cycles. Travel routes were classified using a decision tree model, achieving an accuracy of 95.7 %, and indicating that the most frequented zones correspond to educational and commercial areas. The findings reveal that only 22 % of trips involve public transportation, while 78 % rely on private vehicles, emphasizing the urgent need to promote sustainable transport systems.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, which capture temporal and spatial changes in brain activity, serve as essential tools for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of epilepsy. In recent developments, computational methods have shown substantial progress in automated seizure detection systems. This review focuses on four core components in EEG based seizure detection. Traditional machine learning approaches are outlined, emphasizing the role of statistical patterns and engineered features. Third, hybrid deep learning approaches are described that combine multiple model types to improve detection accuracy and generalization among diverse patient populations. Finally, advanced models such as Transformers and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are highlighted for their ability to model complex temporal and spatial EEG signal dynamics. This review offers a systematic and critical overview of current methodologies, with the aim of supporting future research efforts in EEG-based seizure detection systems and clinical deployment strategies."

By mapping plaintext integers into coprime residue classes, the RNS pre-processor efficiently converts numerical data into DNA base-pair representations, enabling lightweight yet secure encryption. We detail both the encryption and decryption workflows step-by-step, illustrating with a fully worked example that highlights the interplay between modular arithmetic and nucleotide encoding. To demonstrate practical viability and foster hands-on learning, we provide two complementary implementations: one realized entirely in Microsoft Excel using formulae and conditional formatting, and another scripted in MATLAB for performance analysis and visualization. Comparative results showcase the method’s robustness against brute-force and statistical attacks, while the spreadsheet version offers an intuitive platform for students to experiment with cryptographic concepts. This dual-tool approach bridges theory and practice, empowering educators and learners to explore DNA cryptography through familiar software environments."

This paper outlines the most common failure mechanisms affecting the various components of SMs, identifying their root causes and their impact on machine performance. On this basis, it presents the main conventional diagnostic tests commonly used for assessing the condition of these machines, while discussing their applicability and restrictions.

Simulation results show that as the number of interfering signals increases, the smart antenna's beampattern fails to accurately point to the target's Direction of Arrival (DoA), but the MIMO radar leverages the expanded degrees of freedom provided by its M x N virtual antenna array effect to effectively track the target's DoA, even with numerous interfering signals.

    "abstract": "Interaction with the digital world is a recurrent barrier for people with physical disabilities, especially those with reduced or no upper limb mobility. Although peripheral human-computer interaction devices controlled by other limbs (lower limbs or head) exist, many are inaccessible due to their cost, complexity or lack of usability for the task. This study presents a working prototype of an electronic assistive humancomputer interaction device controlled by head movements, designed for users in low-resource environments. Based on Arduino Pro Micro and MPU-6050 IMU, the device translates head movements into on-screen pointer interaction control, with an automatic click function that is activated after 5 seconds of cursor fixation. The hardware is housed in a customized structure 3D printed using recycled PET-G and optimized for comfort and ease of use. The process was structured following a Human Centered Design (HCD) methodology, which iterated the development of the prototype with a group of real users with multiple disabilities served by a foundation whose activity is focused on the care of people with disabilities and motor problems. After calibration and parameter adjustment, users demonstrated improved interaction capabilities, with increased efficiency in the execution of key tasks such as on-screen pointer addressing and positioning and basic navigation, and user acceptance scores were established for usability. The device is portable, low-cost, and replicable, making it a promising option for initial testing and potential application in educational institutions, rehabilitation centers, and home environments. By removing interaction barriers, this solution contributes to social inclusion and contributes from a concrete application of biomedical engineering to assistive technologies. It is expected that future phases of the research will add assessments tailored to various usage scenarios and more complex tasks."

This work presents the design and implementation of an automated system for the remote control of motorized valves in product storage tanks, developed in accordance with the ANSI/ISA-101.01-2015 standard. The proposed architecture integrates Rockwell Automation’s Logix Designer for PLC programming, FactoryTalk View HMI with PlantPAx standards, and Modbus TCP/IP communication via the Prosoft MVI56E-MNETR module. The system was validated through simulation using Factory I/O, replicating the operating conditions of a clean product terminal. The results indicate significant improvements: energy savings of 849.79 kWh in filling operations and 567.22 kWh in discharge, along with maintenance cycle reductions from five to two filter changes per year. These findings demonstrate enhanced operational reliability, reduced human risk, and increased sustainability. Moreover, the proposed approach is adaptable to similar industrial contexts, providing a replicable model aligned with current automation standards and energy-efficiency objectives."

To chart this trajectory, we analysed 405 publications indexed in Scopus and Web of Science (2015-2024). Bibliometric processing with Bibliometrix and VOSviewer revealed an uninterrupted growth curve-compound annual growth rate $\\approx 8 \\%$-driven by a collaborative network dominated by the United Kingdom, the United States and Nordic hubs. Eight core investigators, spearheaded by Fonagy and Bateman, account for $33 \\%$ of the literature, while openaccess journals publish one-third of the output, accelerating clinical translation. Thematically, MBT research still gravitates around BPD; however, keyword co-occurrence networks signal a decisive migration toward eating disorders, forensic contexts and early psychosis. This bibliometric mapping shows that MBT is expanding in synchrony with health-service demands for scalable, cost-efficient psychological interventions and underscores the need for multicentre trials to validate its effectiveness across diverse cultural and service settings."

With the rapid growth of technology, there’s a lot more variety of attack that targets face recognition. These attacks are called Presentation Attack (PA). PA include the likes of print attack, video replay, and 3D masks. For that reason, a system to identify those kinds of attacks are made called Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS). In this paper, the FAS system is created using public datasets and are converted into a graph data structure. To make the graph data, we use algorithms like Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) and Gray-Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) to make it. After the graph data has been created, we use a deep learning model called Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to classify between a real or fake face.The result that is obtained from testing the model, is tested in a variety of conditions such as different learning rate, optimizer, and batch size. Based on those conditions, the best result we obtained is using a learning rate of 0.001, Adam optimizer, and 32 batch size because the value of APCER, BPCER, and ACER is lower than the other conditions."

By establishing algebraic criteria via a nonreduced-order approach, explicit settling time estimates are derived while excluding Zeno behavior. The theoretical results are verified through simulations, and the proposed method is further applied to secure communication using synchronized IMNNs for image encryption."

    "abstract": "Soft faults caused by capacitor degradation lead to performance drift and reliability loss in dc-dc converters, while measurement noise further destabilizes diagnosis. This work addresses both single and combined degradation of input and output capacitors, aiming for robust diagnosis under noisy conditions with minimal measurement points. A framework is proposed that integrates Statistical Multi-Metric Ranking (SM²R) with a lightweight deep classifier, Residual and Dilated Residual Wide CNN (RaDR-WCNN). RaDR-WCNN directly processes raw voltage waveforms using wide first-layer kernels and multi-scale dilated residual blocks to improve feature robustness in noisy conditions. S-M²R quantitatively evaluates candidate measurement points based on distribution separability, feature redundancy, noise resilience, and distribution alignment, identifies the optimal two-point and three-point subsets for classification. These subsets are validated under additive white Gaussian noise, and broader noise robustness is evaluated on the four-point baseline across both white and colored noise. Results confirm that the proposed framework enables accurate and noise resilient diagnosis of capacitor degradation while minimizing measurement points, showing promise for practical deployment in converter systems."

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a fast and cost-efficient way to collect large-scale labelled data for supervised machine learning. However, crowdsourcing leads to noisy labels due to the variability of crowd workers’ expertise. Conventional label aggregation techniques address noisy labels but ignore their inter-relationships among the different instances. This paper proposes FLCLA (Four-Level Crowdsourced Label Aggregation), a hierarchical framework that dynamically adapts to data quality by partitioning instances into four context-aware subsets: confidence, positive, boundary, and noisy. FLCLA first evaluates label reliability by considering both individual instances and their neighborhood structures, leveraging proximity (k-nearest neighbors) and dissimilarity (k-farthest neighbours) to capture instance interdependence. For confidence sets, Majority Voting (MV) is used, whereas the positive subset employs weighted Majority Voting (WMV) based on k-nearest neighbors. For boundary instances, WMV is extended to incorporate both nearest and farthest neighbors. Finally, noisy instances are resolved using supervised classifiers trained on the combined confidence, positive, and boundary subsets. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark crowdsourced datasets demonstrate that FLCLA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art label aggregation methods in terms of accuracy."

In 2023, massive savings have been observed in Europe following an unprecedented global energy crisis. However, assessing the impact of such a crisis on electricity consumption behaviour is challenging. Moreover, standard statistical models based on meteorological and seasonal data have difficulty dealing with such sudden changes. Here, we show that mobility indices based on mobile network data reporting daily presence data significantly improve the performance of state-of-the-art models in electricity demand forecasting during France's government-pushed energy sobriety period. We start by introducing our mobility dataset, comparing it to others, and showing that adding mobility indices to models outperforms the state-of-the-art during winter 2022-2023. Then, we develop interpretable insights by characterizing how winter of 2022-2023 was atypical in terms of electricity demand and by showing how our mobile network data captures work dynamics. In effect, our results characterise the effect of employment-related behaviour patterns on electricity demand."

    "abstract": "The series-connected insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) always endure a secondary voltage imbalance introduced by the difference of tail current. The state-of-the-art models often oversimplify or neglect key physical processes like carrier transport and recombination, leading to inaccurate descriptions of the tail current and complicating the characterization of secondary voltage imbalance. To address this issue, a physics-based model of IGBT is analytically established, which could accurately describe the tail current characteristics. First, this paper introduces an improved carrier transport formulation that incorporates the description of space charge generation current and the characterization of non-linear carrier distribution. Furthermore, an equivalent carrier lifetime expression is developed to describe the recombination effect more comprehensively by incorporating the recombination mechanism under the low carrier concentration conditions. Based on this IGBT model, a circuit composed of series-connected IGBTs is constructed to investigate the mechanism of secondary voltage imbalance. Finally, the accuracy and superiority of the proposed model were validated through comparative experiments and simulations. Compared to conventional models, the proposed model achieves a 42.66% improvement in accuracy in describing the voltage imbalance between series-connected IGBTs. Furthermore, the proposed model provides valuable references and theoretical support for the design of voltage balancing strategies and circuit parameters in series-connected IGBT equipment."

To minimize its impact on the overall stiffness of the soft body, the endoskeleton was designed with a slim profile, flexible connections, and 3D-printed with elastic material (Shore A hardness 50), selected to roughly match the mechanical properties of the surrounding silicone matrix (typically with Shore 00 hardness 20–30). Key features of the proposed solution include a 3D-printable guide for tendon routing that is (1) fully soft, (2) easy to place, (3) rapidly reconfigurable for arbitrary tendon paths, (4) adaptable to variable soft body geometries, and (5) easy to fabricate with single-step casting.

PWaveSense achieved 100% accuracy after a post-hoc threshold-sweep calibration that optimized performance. However, the results are limited to binary classification on two real-world DAS datasets.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a neural network (NN)-based calibration framework via quantization code reconstruction to address the critical limitation of multidimensional NNs (MDNNs) in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) calibration, where performance degrades drastically under varying input frequencies or sampling rates. Conventional MDNN methods suffer from distribution shifts caused by dynamic oversampling ratio (OSR) variations, necessitating repeated retraining. Our innovation lies in a data reconstruction mechanism: for lower OSR scenarios, a third-order cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) filter inserts pseudo-data points between quantization code to match the NN’s input dimension. For higher OSR scenarios, cyclic downsampling decomposes the original sequence into parallel subsequences processed independently by the same network. For multitone signals, a reconstruction–calibration–summation flow hierarchically handles spectral components. Implemented on an FPGA and covalidated with a commercial 14-bit/1 GSPS pipeline ADC, the framework demonstrates robust performance without retraining. Experimental results show: bandwidth expansion from 16.3% to 84.7% of the Nyquist bandwidth. SFDR improvement of 13.8–27.7 dB and ENOB gain of 2.3–4.6 bits across 10.3–160.3 MHz inputs. This work enables consistent high-precision ADC calibration in dynamic signal environments, facilitating deployment in complex application scenarios."

    "abstract": "The accurate forecasting of energy consumption is a cornerstone of efficient energy management, particularly within complex entities such as university campuses. These environments are characterized by non-stationary demand patterns susceptible to abrupt changes, a phenomenon known as Concept Drift, which poses a substantial challenge to conventional forecasting models. This paper introduces and validates a holistic, three-phase methodological framework designed to address these challenges. We conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of three machine learning algorithms— Random Forest (RF), LightGBM, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)—using high-resolution temporal data from a university building. The framework's initial phase establishes a baseline and diagnoses the severe impact of Concept Drift. The second phase implements a dynamic sliding window retraining protocol, demonstrating its necessity for model adaptation. The final, decisive phase integrates advanced feature engineering, which proves to be the most critical component for achieving high-fidelity predictions. Our results indicate that this final optimization stage reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for all models to a convergence point of approximately 1.1 kWh. Notably, this enhancement elevates the performance of the LightGBM model to a level commensurate with the specialized LSTM network. The study concludes that the development of a robust methodological framework, encompassing drift adaptation and sophisticated feature engineering, is of greater importance than the selection of a specific algorithm in isolation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study on the implementation of a color image compression system of various sizes by combining different compression methods on an FPGA to optimize storage space. The image compression system applies standard techniques in many image compression architectures, including converting images to the YCbCr color space, reducing the number of samples on CbCr channels through the Downsampling step, and then applying 3-level DWT to decompose the image into LL, LH, HL, and HH components. In which, LL3, containing much important information, will continue to be processed by DCT and quantized; HH1, LH1, HL1 components will be removed; the remaining components are quantized. Finally, all data is encoded using the Arithmetic coding algorithm for efficient compression. The entire image compression process is performed directly on the FPGA using Verilog language, while MATLAB is used to decode the output data and calculate the image quality evaluation parameters. The results show that the system achieves a compression ratio nearly equivalent to that of the software, while maintaining good image quality. The operating frequency reaches 113.6 MHz for image sizes of 512×512, 1024×768, 1024×1024, and slightly decreases to 111.11 MHz for image sizes of 960×960 and 1280×1000."

    "abstract": "Coffee is one of Indonesia’s leading commodities with high economic value, especially the Arabica variety because it contains higher levels of natural sugars and acids, compared to other coffee varieties. However, the quality of Arabica beans is greatly influenced by their physical and visual conditions, especially the presence of defects. Defect detection in coffee beans is crucial for maintaining the quality and efficiency of postharvest processing in the coffee industry. YOLOv4 is a fast object detection algorithm, but its performance decreases when detecting small objects that are close together. To improve defect detection in Arabica coffee beans, this study proposes an improvement in YOLOv4 using the proposed More Focused Non Maximum Suppression (MF-NMS) method, which normalizes the coordinates of the lower left and upper right corners of the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. This is done to reduce the impact of small errors in object position prediction. The data used in this study consists of green Arabica coffee beans categorized as normal, hollow, broken, and black. The results show that the proposed model achieves a 7.50% increase in $\\mathbf{m A P} \\text{@} \\mathbf{0. 5}$ compared to the baseline model."

DeckFlow supports a specification decomposition workflow where an initial goal is iteratively decomposed into smaller parts and combined using feature labels and clusters. DeckFlow supports generative space exploration by generating multiple prompt and output variations, presented in a grid, that can feed back recursively into the next design iteration. We evaluate DeckFlow for text-to-image generation against a state-of-practice conversational AI baseline for image generation tasks. We then add audio generation and investigate user behaviors in a more open-ended creative setting with text, image, and audio outputs."

Premature failures are often the result of damage to the bearing raceways due to contaminant ingress, poor lubrication, or a combination of both. Two essential strategies can have a profound impact on extending bearing service life: adequate protection against contamination and proper lubrication.This paper will discuss how spherical roller bearings with integral seals are an ideal solution for applications in heavily contaminated environments. Proven benefits include improved worker safety, reduction in environmental impact, extended lubrication intervals, and increased equipment runtime. Sealed spherical roller bearings are available in a variety of sizes and can often be substituted in place of an open bearing with little to no equipment modifications."

Both open source and paid algorithms are capable of creating deepfake images with the likelihood of a person. This is problematic since those deepfakes can be created with social-media images without consent, and used to spoof Face Recognition engines. That is why, in this research, we test the vulnerabilities of common Face Recognition methods to deepfake presentations. First, we gathered a dataset of 12 volunteers and created deepfake images of each one. We explored Stable Diffusion’s LoRA and ControlNet methods for deepfake generation. Then, we contrasted biometric indices before and after including the deepfakes in the dataset. The results indicate that EER and FRR increase in average by $1.28 \\%$ and $3.40 \\%$, respectively, when introducing deepfakes in the dataset. This indicates that the tested face recognition engines encountered problems discerning a person from their deepfake, and that Presentation Attack Detection systems are imperative."

The dataset contains 54,492 samples representing various attacks on UAV Wi-Fi communications, which were carefully preprocessed.

We also applied additional evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, which confirmed the models' effectiveness in accurately detecting UAV network attacks.

While prior work has examined barriers faced by women in computing, little is known about the lived experiences of women researchers, specifically those navigating careers across academia and industry. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten novice and experienced women researchers across three continents. Using inductive analysis and open coding of transcribed interviews, we identified thirteen career-related challenges, organized into three overarching themes: absence of belonging, experiences of implicit bias, and increased emotional burden. Participants described heightened gender awareness in computing environments, which contributed to feelings of isolation and hindered professional growth. Our findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to support the career trajectories of women researchers, foster inclusive research communities, and ultimately reduce the gender gap in computing."

In primary school, persistent learning difficulties have been identified, most of which are linked to mastering literacy skills—an essential foundation for educational progress. The interactive tool TitíApp, designed to correct errors such as omissions, substitutions, and rotations, has proved effective in enhancing children’s reading abilities. This application not only supports the teaching—learning process but also helps narrow the digital divide across different sectors. The aim of this study was to compare children’s reading competencies before and after using TitíApp. A pre and post-assessment methodology was employed with the Toro and Cervera Reading-Writing Analysis Test, applied in accordance with ethical standards for minors. The sample comprised 234 students from public and private schools in Pichincha Province. Findings revealed a reduction in errors when reading letters, syllables, and words, as well as an overall improvement in reading comprehension. The discussion highlights the growing positive impact of technological tools in education, noting that Tití App was particularly effective in improving students’ reading fluency and comprehension. Ultimately, the use of this tool offers an engaging and effective means of restoring reading skills while reflecting a culturally grounded approach within the Ecuadorian context."

Steam pressure, excess oxygen, and steam flow are effectively controlled; when one of them changes, the others are disturbed."

This paper presents a threat modeling framework to reduce the attack surface associated with the OWASP IoT Top 10. To validate the approach, we developed a controlled experimental environment using real IoT devices (Arduino Mega 2560 and Raspberry Pi 3B+), identifying key threats such as denial-of-service, brute force, and ARP poisoning. Security measures-including encrypted protocols (e.g., MQTT over TLS, HTTPS), non-standard ports, and access control rules-were implemented. A comparative risk assessment was conducted between a baseline system with default settings and a hardened system applying the proposed mitigations. Results show a substantial risk reduction: OWASP-related scores dropped from 10.2 to 2.4, and cyberattack risks from 16.0 to 2.0, shifting the system from critical to low-risk. This study provides a replicable methodology for IoT risk analysis, demonstrates the effectiveness of lightweight countermeasures, and underscores the importance of integrating security early in the design phase."

In a private hospital, challenges arise from revenue fluctuations of around $25 \\%$ to $30 \\%$ per year. Clinical program monitoring serves as a key strategy to support both service quality and financial management, as suboptimal performance can destabilize revenue growth. Studies explored time-series forecasting with hybrid models but were limited by hyperparameter sensitivity and exogenous variables. Recognizing the relevance of clinical achievement and workforce metrics to the gross growth over revenue (GGOR), this research leverages time-series clinical data (2021 to 2024) and applies a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) approach. The hybrid approach demonstrated strong forecast performance, achieving RMSE of 0.04, MAE of 0.02, MAPE of $47 \\%$, and R-squared of 0.79. A counterfactual analysis and trajectory plotting were conducted, providing actionable insights for hospital financial planning. Quantitatively, the model establishes a baseline hybrid time-series forecast for clinical program revenue, offering evidence of the interplay between clinical outcomes and workforce metrics in driving GGOR. Future research is recommended to incorporate clinical variables to strengthen time-series forecasting in healthcare financial management."

The research includes an analysis of the economic performance of microgrids without energy storage, and investigates optimal operation strategies and electricity purchase plans when a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$50 \\text{kW} / 100 \\text{kWh}$</tex> energy storage system is integrated. Utilizing linear and quadratic programming models, the study further optimizes the power and capacity configurations of energy storage to identify the most effective coordinated scheme. It also explores optimal energy storage strategies in the joint operation of multiple parks versus independent operation, and considers future scenarios with load growth and time-of-use pricing. The findings reveal that while high storage costs often outweigh benefits in most parks, optimized configurations can improve economic performance in some cases. Additionally, joint operation significantly reduces wasted wind and solar energy, lowers operational costs, and enhances economic efficiency. This study innovatively integrates joint microgrid operation with dynamic storage allocation under real-world constraints, such as load growth and time-of-use pricing, providing a scalable framework for practical applications."

    "abstract": "Since satellites can provide stable communication services to uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite aerial networks become an important part of the sixth generation (6 G) networks. The service of satellites relies on UAVs' location information, while actively real-time location information reporting of UAVs incurs large communication overhead and poses substantial security risks. Specifically, UAVs may be threatened by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) spoofing attacks, which is carried out by obtaining UAVs' location information. To meet these challenges, in this paper, we propose an overhead-efficient communication scheme for satellite aerial networks without requiring UAVs' location information reporting, which not only saves communication resources, but also offers resilience against GNSS attacks. The total average communication rate of the system is analyzed, and its analytical expression, based on the point beam radius and frequency modulation interval, is derived. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the sum of the transmission rates for multiple high-dynamic UAVs served by the satellite in various scenarios, as well as a performance comparison between the proposed and traditional methods under GNSS attack scenarios."

    "abstract": "Deep transfer learning (DTL), especially domain adaptation (DA) based techniques, has broadly extended the scope of practical fault diagnosis which struggles with generalization under variable operating conditions. However, real-world applications often involve noisy source domains with significant label and feature corruption, posing severe challenges to existing DTL approaches. In this work, we introduce the weakly-supervised domain adaptation network (WSDAN), a novel framework designed to tackle these issues through transfer curriculum learning (TCL) and dual learning strategies. WSDAN prioritizes informative samples from noisy source domains and enhances cross-domain generalization by utilizing inherent supervision in unlabeled target domain data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that WSDAN outperforms current DTL and DA methods, particularly in high noise and significant domain discrepancy scenarios. This study highlights WSDAN’s robust performance and practical utility, paving the way for more reliable fault diagnosis in complex, real-world conditions."

    "abstract": "Smart clothing has emerged as a promising IoT-based healthcare platform by enabling distributed physiological sensing through body sensor networks (BSN). However, most systems rely on embedded chips and batteries, increasing complexity, weight, and cost that limit practicality. We present a battery-free chipless smart clothing that integrates thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-encapsulated passive LC relay networks to establish magnetic coupling between an external sensor reader and underlying arteries. Arterial pulsations induce resonant frequency shifts in the coupled system, enabling real-time pulse signal detection. Each sensing coil of passive LC relay networks is positioned at carotid, heart, radial, and femoral arteries, and four pickup coils are routed to a centralized hub on the upper left arm. A lightweight wireless reader with four channels simultaneously acquires multi-site physiological signals. Importantly, passive LC relay networks serve as magnetic field repeaters, enhancing magnetic coupling across extended distances. By matching resonant frequencies of passive LC relay networks and sensor reader at 7.3 MHz, the system achieved a power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 46.56 %, clearly outperforming the capacitor-free configuration, which yielded only 6 %. Notably, a minimum PTE threshold of 0.24 % was established for distinguishable pulse detection. The system showed robustness after water-spray exposure and supported signal acquisition through outer garments up to 21.22 mm thick between sensor reader and centralized hub, confirming resilience to sweat and compatibility with layered clothing. Overall, our battery-free chipless BSN offers lightweight, low-cost, and disposable smart clothing solutions for simultaneous multi-site hemodynamic monitoring, potentially calculating pulse wave velocity for peripheral vascular stiffness assessment."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation function space and a confidence map – both parameterized by a neural network – to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of our method on two vision devices and across four pneumatically actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft manipulators."

    "abstract": "Efficient fire detection is crucial for minimizing wildfire potential impact. In this study, a new index, TSAI (Temporal and Spatial Anomaly Index), is proposed for fire detection. For a given pixel, it is calculated in terms of the difference in Sentinel-2 B12 reflectance of the pixel between during and before a fire, as well as the difference in Sentinel-2 B12 reflectance between the pixel and the surrounding non-fire pixels. The fire detection method based on the TSAI threshold was developed and tested in 19 study areas across different continents worldwide, encompassing various climatic and vegetation types. The results show TSAI exhibited remarkable accuracy in detecting fire, achieving an average commission error ratio (CE) of 11.43% and an average omission error ratio (OE) of 5.47% across all study areas. The TSAI-based detection method has a high degree of automation and shows great potential for large-scale fire monitoring. In addition, the TSAI construction method in this study can also serve as a reference for the development of other new disaster detection indices."

    "abstract": "Modern malware has garnered significant attention due to its devastating impact, driving the implementation of classifiers trained on datasets that aim to detect its type or family at runtime. While this approach is valuable for incident response and containment, it does not provide an evaluation of the protection against attacks that malware can carry out, which is essential for estimating its potential impact and performing a risk assessment. In addition to the lack of datasets labeled with attacks, modern malware has a dynamic, complex, polymorphic, and multi-attack behavior, making this evaluation more challenging. In this paper, we present a method based on a semi-supervised learning approach that allows the evaluation of the attacks protection achieved by a malware family classifier. Unsupervised learning is used to identify the clusters on a dataset that define possible attacks. Supervised learning, on the other hand, is used to train a malware family classifier with the original labels of the dataset. Then, both outcomes are interpreted and mapped. We present the results of applying this method to the CIC-MalMem-2022 dataset, evaluating the level of protection against privacy attacks achieved by seven malware family classifiers. Our method achieves comparable results to alternative approaches without requiring dataset relabeling or training additional classifiers."

This paper proposes the deployment of a predictive care model to facilitate clinical referrals (inpatient or outpatient) for patients with COVID-19, utilizing supervised learning techniques such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest. The procedure adheres to the Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD) paradigm, consisting of six stages: import, data quality assessment, transformation, modeling, evaluation, and implementation. A primary objective was to create a refined dataset from the medical histories of diagnosed patients, selecting pertinent clinical factors for model development and assessment. This prototype serves as an essential instrument to facilitate medical decision-making in critical situations, namely with the referral of patients with COVID-19 for inpatient or outpatient care. The principal beneficiaries are medical professionals, who will have access to a resource that expedites and clinically substantiates their decision-making process, promoting more efficient and data-informed treatment."

Light-motion events are logged locally for later retrieval, while high-impact events are transmitted on detection. Laboratory and shipboard trials indicate reliable detection with low energy usage. The results support the feasibility of event-driven LoRaWAN sensing for long-term maritime monitoring and lay the groundwork for future improvements such as adaptive thresholds and lightweight machine-learning-based analytics."

Four specific situations are of interest – the morning high peak value, the evening high peak value, the nightly low peak value, and the daily low peak value. Different hourly statistical measures were estimated on a monthly basis for each one of them, such as the average value, minimum value, maximum value, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval. Furthermore, all data was analyzed and divided depending on the type of the day – weekday or weekend, as in most situations, there is a noticeable difference between them. The obtained results show that there isn’t a clear pattern, which forms the peak values (low and high) of the electrical energy price, though some similarities can be observed between certain months. This indicates that statistical analysis is not enough if the optimal times for charging and discharging energy storage should be estimated. More advanced models should be used, based on machine learning and deep learning, if precise forecasting is to be done, which is an objective for future studies."

The controller consists of a DC side voltage controller and an AC side current controller, and has a nested closed-loop structure. The DC side voltage controller estimates the change of the DC side load and adjusts the reference current of the AC side current controller in real time, so that the rectifier DC side voltage can make a fast dynamic response to the change of load and return to the set value. A multi-vector model predictive current controller was designed to reduce the harmonic spectrum dispersion of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{A C}$</tex> side current caused by the switching frequency variation.

We present DevTales, a VSCode extension that integrates fine-grained subgoal labels, captured web-foraging activity, and LLM-generated narrative summaries directly with code in the IDE. We evaluated DevTales in three mixed-methods user studies spanning debugging, understanding rationale, and code reuse. Results show that subgoal labels and “See in Code” links enable rapid top-down navigation and code localization, while embedded web resources clarify unfamiliar artifacts. Narrative summaries proved valuable for answering deep “why” questions by explicitly linking causal relationships among history items, but were avoided during quick sensemaking contexts due to their verbosity. We discuss design implications for history-aware code search, adaptive narrative summarization, and inference transparency in LLM-generated stories."

This paper proposes AutoSIGHT, Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds, AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of 0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution between the human and AI players (e.g., when the experts need to be replaced, or the task at hand changes rapidly).

The choice of biomass-based carbon sources over small molecules was motivated by cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability and widespread availability. Furthermore, green CDs have potential applications in sensing solvent polarity, metal ions, organic molecules and in vitro/in vivo imaging of plant and animal cells. The CDs were characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, and SEM techniques and subsequently evaluated as polarity sensors in ethanol–water mixtures under UV irradiation. Additionally, an agar–agar gel incorporating CDs was prepared to examine photoluminescence under UV exposure, demonstrating potential for qualitative determination of moisture content in liquids."

This work presents a conceptual design for a complete upgrade of an existing hyperspectral system based on the SPECIM N17E pushbroom spectrograph, where the main purpose is to capture soil samples, but the proposed design is not limited to this and can be successfully used with a wider application. The initial configuration suffers from some shortcomings, such as lack of optical isolation, non-standardized illumination and absence of synchronization between mechanical motion control and data acquisition, which compromises the quality and repeatability of measurements. The proposed design addresses these problems by introducing a light-isolated chamber with an internal coating to suppress stray light, standardized illumination geometry with quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) sources and a precise focusing mechanism. The main innovation of the concept is the integration of an additional networked module based on Raspberry Pi (RPI), which provides centralized user control, data collection and management, and most importantly, synchronization between the software processes for controlling the mechanical mobile table and for collecting data from the camera. This architecture is expected to transform the existing system into a robust platform capable of generating high-quality data required for the development of advanced models for soil nitrogen analysis and other agrochemical applications."

    "abstract": "This study investigates South African farmers’ perceptions of cybersecurity in smart farming technologies through a quantitative approach. As farming methods increasingly adopt advanced technologies like IoT, cloud computing, and AI systems, the agricultural industry faces rising risks from cybersecurity threats. Using a 15-item questionnaire administered to 312 farmers, The study examined awareness levels, perceived threats, implementation of protective measures, trust in technology providers, and adoption barriers. The exploratory factor analysis underscored the identification of five separate dimensions regarding cybersecurity perceptions, reflecting substantial reliability coefficients (Cronbach’ s α = 0.81–0.87). ANOVA results demonstrated significant differences across farm sizes, with larger operations showing better cybersecurity readiness. The findings highlight the need for targeted educational interventions, affordable security solutions, and policy support to strengthen cybersecurity practices in South African smart farming."

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of publicly available datasets to develop a machine learning model for detecting electromagnetic data exfiltration via RAM-based Radio Frequency attack in an air-gap system, we established a lab using low-cost and readily available hardware. This paper presents a proof-ofconcept for a covert data transmission system that exploits electromagnetic side-channel emissions from computer memory access patterns, distinguishing it from previous CPU, SATA, or USB-based approaches. Unlike existing electromagnetic covert channels that rely on peripheral components, our RAM-based approach directly manipulates memory access patterns to generate detectable radio frequency signals at $\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ M H z}$, offering superior stealth characteristics and broader applicability across diverse hardware configurations. We achieved successful electromagnetic signal transmission using a C++ developed transmitter program that modulates CPU and memory-intensive operations, and a Python-based receiver integrated with RTL-SDR on the receiver system. A dataset that captured the anomaly in the transmitter system was generated. The features included in the resulting dataset were the timestamped process metrics with binary classification for the anomaly, which offers valuable input for machine learning model development. Although complete file reconstruction remains challenging due to bit-level alignment issues, weak signal emission, and noise interference, the research proves the fundamental vulnerability of electromagnetic emissions from computer memory. With the implementation of our enhanced synchronization protocol that incorporates error correction and adaptive noise filtering, we achieved quantifiable improvements, resulting in a $68 \\%$ file reconstruction success rate compared to the initial $\\mathbf{4 2 \\%}$. Also, the signal detection increased to $\\mathbf{7 3 \\%}$ accuracy, $\\mathbf{1 0 0 0}$ bps effective transmission rate with $\\mathbf{1 5 \\%}$ error rate, and $\\mathbf{0. 5}$-meter operational range. The findings and generated dataset have significant implications for cybersecurity, particularly for securing air-gapped networks and sensitive computing environments."

    "abstract": "Early smoke detection is critical for wildfire prevention and industrial safety, yet image-level classification under UAV conditions remains challenging due to low contrast, thin and transient plumes, cluttered backgrounds, and variable illumination. The Flame and Smoke Detection Dataset (FASDD) has expanded benchmarking beyond narrow scenes, but much of the literature emphasizes object detection or few-shot classification. Reported results on FASDD show that Fireformer achieves 87.3% accuracy, ConvNeXt 88.6%, and EfficientNetV2 $82.69 \\%$, while FireCLIP, leveraging multimodal pretraining, reaches $98.56 \\%$. To balance accuracy and deployability for UAV platforms, we propose an ASPP-Enhanced U-Net with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) channel recalibration, a compact encoder-decoder repurposed for image-level classification via global pooling of decoder features. The design combines batchnormalized residual blocks for stable optimization, attention-gated skip connections to suppress irrelevant context, an SE mechanism to emphasize subtle smoke cues, and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) bottleneck to aggregate multiscale features for both faint wisps and broader plumes. On the FASDD_RS subset, the proposed model attains a best validation accuracy of $97.29 \\%$, substantially outperforming Fireformer, ConvNeXt, and EfficientNetV2, while remaining within $\\boldsymbol{\\sim} \\mathbf{1 \\%}$ of FireCLIP. Pixel-level evaluation further demonstrates strong background suppression (overall accuracy 0.955, precision 0.80, recall 0.81, IoU 0.68, Dice 0.81). These results highlight that a UNet backbone, augmented with ASPP and SE attention, delivers high accuracy in a single end-to-end model that is compact and well-suited for UAV-based early smoke detection."

    "abstract": "Motivated by the distributed nature of many network applications, this paper proposes a new online learning problem called multi-stage bandits. In multi-stage bandits, a job needs to go through multiple stages, each managed by a different agent, before generating an outcome. Each agent can only control its own action and learn the final outcome of the job. It has neither knowledge nor control on actions taken by agents in the next stage. The goal of this paper is to develop distributed online learning algorithms that achieve sublinear regret in adversarial environments. The setting of this paper significantly expands the traditional multi-armed bandit problem, which considers only one agent and one stage. In addition to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the traditional multi-armed bandit problem, we show that the consideration of multiple stages introduces a third component, education, where an agent needs to choose its actions to facilitate the learning of agents in the next stage. To solve this newly introduced exploration-exploitation-education trilemma, we propose a simple distributed online learning algorithm, ϵ−EXP3. We theoretically prove that the ϵ−EXP3 algorithm is a no-regret policy that achieves sublinear regret. We also show that the regret of ϵ−EXP3 is close to the regret lower bound under a class of time-homogeneous oracle policies. Finally, we conduct simulation studies on a variety of network applications. Simulation results show that the ϵ−EXP3 algorithm significantly outperforms existing no-regret online learning algorithms for the traditional multi-armed bandit problem."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a 2.5-bit polarization-rotating transmit array is proposed for ultra-wideband 6G terahertz communications. The transmit array utilizes a unit-cell structure combining a polarization rotator and a polarizer, enabling broadband phase tuning and impedance matching with 2.5-bit phase control. By applying single- and dual-bar topologies to the rotator, a low Q-factor matching controller was implemented, enabling low-transmission loss and wideband performance. Six types of unit cells were designed to realize 2.5-bit discrete phase states with a 260° tuning range. Arrangement of the unit cell was optimized based on the reference phase to minimize quantization loss, enabling optimal array configuration for high-efficiency beamforming. The fabricated 30 × 30 transmit array achieved a peak gain of 28.6 dBi, an aperture efficiency of 31.8%, and a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 46.5 GHz, 32.1%. Furthermore, the communication distance range was experimentally evaluated using error vector magnitude measurements with modulated signals, demonstrating increases of 3 times compared with that of a standalone horn antenna. Consequently, the proposed transmit array achieved a data rate of 1.44 Gbps at a distance of 100 cm, as confirmed by modulated signal throughput measurements."

    "abstract": "Pointing control technology is critical for numerous applications such as space communication and target surveillance. The challenge for pointing systems is to achieve the highest possible control accuracy under actuator constraints and various uncertainties, where the typical single-controller structure struggles to deliver the desired performance due to its inherent conflict between different objectives. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework enhanced by an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE). The framework incorporates two innovative strategies: 1) a time-varying UDE (TV-UDE) to avoid transient peaking phenomena and ensure reliable disturbance estimation, and 2) a flexible mechanism that dynamically adjusts the range of nominal control based on UDE’s output such that the actuator constraint is fulfilled. This flexible mechanism avoids the usage of offline over-tightened constraints, providing a safe and less-conservative input range for MPC. As far as we know, this paper provides the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">first comprehensive framework</i> for pointing systems, which is capable of maximizing control performance while handling constraints and disturbances.

The proposed solution incorporates three major enhancements: a GSConv-based Slim-Neck structure in the neck network that combines depthwise separable convolution with global context modeling to reduce computational load while improving multi-scale feature fusion efficiency; an InceptionNeXt module embedded in the backbone network that integrates parallel multi-scale convolution with channel separation strategies to decrease parameter count while strengthening local feature extraction; and an EMA attention mechanism integrated into the small-object detection head to enhance sensitivity to small targets through cross-channel interaction and spatial weighting. Experimental validation on the WSODD dataset demonstrates the algorithm’s effectiveness, achieving significant improvements with 2.4M parameters (7.69% reduction) and 6.0 GFLOPs (4.76% reduction), while delivering superior detection performance (78.9% mAP@0.5, a 3.2% improvement; 46.1% mAP@0.5-0.95, a 2.1% improvement) and real-time processing capability (83 FPS, 14.9 FPS increase), making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios while maintaining an optimal balance between lightweight design and enhanced detection performance."

To solve this problem, an adaptive efficiency optimization control (EOC) considering operation uncertainties with enhanced dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) is innovatively proposed. First, an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>-dimensional flux linkage estimator is designed, which enables the quantification of the uncertainty of parameter variations caused by external operating conditions.

With this method, the impact caused by errors in traditional parameter estimation is overcome. Meanwhile, model-based active uncertainty learning avoids the training of large amounts of data and eliminates a significant computational burden. Finally, a comparison is made with existing EOC methods, which proves the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method."

The control law incorporates the disturbance estimate generated by the CFO, and the control signal is transmitted to the system only at event-triggered instants. Based on the ETADCC framework, an additional event-triggered mechanism is designed for the measurement signals, upon which an event-triggered CFO-based active disturbance compensation control method (ETCFO-ETADCC) is proposed. The introduction of dual event-triggering mechanisms enables intermittent transmission of both measurement and control signals, thereby improving the efficiency of communication resource utilization. Through Lyapunov stability theory, the boundedness of the observer error and the stability of the closed-loop system are proven. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through simulations and experiments for quadrotor uncrewed aerial vehicle attitude tracking control."

    "abstract": "The integration of industrial systems and cloud-interaction technologies enhances resource coordination and regulation efficiency, while also introducing new security threats. This article focuses on a unified attack–defense strategy design for active minecart suspension systems (AMSSs). First, to overcome the limitations of existing attack models that often neglect measurement data and adopt undifferentiated attacks, an importance-driven variable-intensity (IDVI) attack strategy is proposed based on the fluctuation severity of measurement data. This strategy dynamically differentiates data importance to launch targeted attacks, thereby amplifying disruptive impact. Second, an observed-attack-mode-dependent (OAMD) resilient security defense mechanism is correspondingly designed. To handle intermittent mode loss and the mismatch between detected and actual modes caused by practical uncertainties, observation probabilities (OPs) are introduced. Meanwhile, a nonconservative probability block technique is developed to accommodate partially unknown OPs. Furthermore, a membership function combination framework characterized by polynomial degrees is incorporated into the controller design to align with the fuzzy structure of AMSSs and improve gain scheduling flexibility, thereby potentially enhancing ride comfort. Finally, simulations and simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed attack strategy and defense mechanism."

We propose an efficient framework to approximate the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the CRB by expressing the gradient of the log marginal likelihood as a posterior expectation. Expectation propagation (EP) is used to approximate the posterior as a Gaussian, enabling accurate moment estimation compablack to pure sampling-based methods. Numerical experiments on small-scale sparse models show that the EP-based CRB approximation achieves lower black average normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and faster convergence than classical baselines in non-Gaussian settings."

Two modes of lighting are used for the experimental work – one which uses an artificial source of light and a camera for images capturing and second which is based on lighting conditions \"like a daylight\". As a device for images capturing is used a digital camera with high resolution in both cases of lighting. The breads are cut on slices and every slice is triple captured on both sides to accumulate images for the research. A statistical analysis based on mathematical expectation and confidence intervals, is made in order to differentiate images of examined samples and the effect of lighting conditions on images content. A k-neighbors classifier by color is used to evaluate distribution of images according to their affiliation to the examined type of bread. The results indicate that the usage of day-light as a source of light leads to more color variations in the captured images, nevertheless for the examined bread samples separability of images based on their color is good."

However, due to the distributed nature of microservices, logs are generated in heterogeneous formats across multiple locations, complicating centralized analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a dedicated log management and analysis framework consisting of: a) Local Log Data Components – Each microservice embeds a MongoDB-based logging application ensuring structured and queryable log storage; b) Unified Log Access API – A standardized endpoint retrieves logs from distributed sources; and c) Centralized Log Data Analysis Component – A sophisticated MongoDB-powered analytics engine that aggregates, normalizes, and processes logs. Our approach demonstrates how distributed microservice logs can be efficiently consolidated and analyzed to support educational data mining tasks enhancing insights into learner behavior and system performance"

    "abstract": "Usability evaluations are essential for ensuring that modern interfaces meet user needs, yet traditional heuristic evaluations by human experts can be time-consuming and subjective, especially early in development. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen’s ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI’s GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen’s Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen’s Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff’s Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides one of the first quantitative inter-rater reliability analyses of automated heuristic evaluation and highlights methods for improving model consistency."

    "abstract": "The rise of informal financial discourse on Indonesian social media poses challenges for sentiment classification due to noisy language and limited annotated data. This study aims to evaluate and improve sentiment classification performance on Indonesian financial tweets using transformer-based models, including IndoBERT-p1, IndoBERT-p2, IndoBERTweet, BERT-Multi, and IndoBERT uncased. Four preprocessing strategies were explored as baseline configurations: raw with emoji, raw without emoji, cleaned with emoji, and cleaned without emoji. Experimental results identified IndoBERTweet with emoji configuration as the best performing combination, achieving an F1 macro score of 0.9710 on the training set and 0.8471 on the validation set, although signs of overfitting were observed. To address this, hyperparameters were fine-tuned and specific model layers were customized, which reduced overfitting and resulted in F1 macro scores of 0.8572 on training and 0.8056 on validation. The model was further tested with and without the introduction of noise in the test data, yielding scores of 0.8177 and 0.8106, respectively. These findings demonstrate the model’s robustness to domain specific noise and emphasize the importance of targeted preprocessing and domain aware fine tuning for effective sentiment analysis in low resource financial contexts."

The study involved highly productive, clinically healthy dairy cows in their third and subsequent lactations. Blood samples were taken three times a day, every twelve hours, from the tail vein, and ionized calcium concentration was measured. Motor activity was recorded using electronic pedometers embedded in collars. The correlation coefficient between ionized calcium levels and daily step count in hypocalcemic cows is 0.499. The correlation coefficient between ionized calcium levels and milk yield in hypocalcemic cows is 0.402. The correlation coefficient between milk yield and daily step count in hypocalcemic cows is 0.819. The rate of change in daily milk yield as a function of changes in ionized calcium levels is 5.48. The rate of change in daily step count as a function of decreases in ionized calcium levels is 2295.17. Using a pedometer to measure movement and monitoring ionized calcium levels, the study found that hypocalcemia reduces milk production and locomotor activity, worsening the quality of life of cows, which threatens their health and leads to losses."

This study investigates the use of a Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast chili prices by examining the effect of hyperparameter tuning, including training epochs, activation functions (tanh, sigmoid, ReLU), and optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD). Daily price data from the National Food Price Panel (April 1, 2021-February 10, 2025) were preprocessed using linear interpolation for missing values and Min-Max normalization. Multiple configurations were tested, with performance measured through MAE, RMSE, MAPE, $R^{2}$, final epoch loss, and runtime. The best configuration-sigmoid activation, Adam optimizer, and 300 epochs-achieved an MAE of 0.0197, RMSE of 0.0434, MAPE of $81.05 \\%$, and $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ of 0.9702. These findings highlight the importance of hyperparameter selection in improving both predictive accuracy and efficiency. The research contributes to methodological discussions on LSTM tuning and provides practical insights for developing AI-driven price forecasting platforms to support policymakers, agribusiness stakeholders, and technology innovators in managing volatility in Indonesia’s food markets."

    "abstract": "Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) production in Malaysia is a high-value agricultural sector hampered by significant yield losses from fungal and viral diseases. Economic pressures and labor shortages create a need for automated, early disease detection systems to ensure crop health and productivity. This review examines the application of computer vision, particularly deep learning models, for identifying common strawberry diseases. We analyze various architectural approaches, including image classification (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet), object detection (e.g., YOLO), and instance segmentation (e.g., Mask R-CNN), which are trained to recognize visual symptoms on strawberry leaves, fruit, and crowns. The findings indicate that while many models achieve high accuracy (over $90 \\%$) on curated datasets, their performance often diminishes in real-world field conditions due to challenges like variable lighting, background complexity, and high symptom similarity between different diseases. A persistent trade-off exists between the high accuracy of computationally intensive models and the real-time processing capabilities of lightweight models suitable for on-device deployment. This paper highlights critical research gaps, including the need for diverse, field-captured datasets and the exploration of explainable AI to build farmer trust."

Receiving too much noise can result in pain such as hearing problems and exhaustion at a high level. In response to the noise problem, this study was done in PT. Karya Mega Sarana, a cable company located in Bekasi, Indonesia to find the evaluation of noise exposure. The methods used are interviews about production machines and building dimensions of the company, surveys with workers about disturbances experienced during production days, measurement of noise intensity, and simulation of noise exposure using Surfer and SoundPLAN Essential 5.1. Based on the results, the noise intensity from production machines is 72.5 dBA in the Drawing building and 74.4 dBA in the Stranding building. The difference in noise distribution may vary depending on the position and whereabouts of every worker. Compared to the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry Policy by 1996, the noise intensity has overreached the limit of recommendation, which is 70 dBA for industrial areas. According to the Guideline by the Ministry of Employment Number 5 Year 2018, the noise intensity from both buildings did not reach the limit of recommendation, 85 dBA for 8 hours of exposure."

    "abstract": "This article examines how prioritizing orders from major customers in the production of corrugated cardboard can negatively impact a company’s operational efficiency. By modifying the previously established schedule to meet these orders, deviations in the planning strategy are generated, which reduces the efficiency in the use of plant resources. To demonstrate this impact, production planning is simulated using an approach based on priority rules and compared with the company’s current method, which utilizes scheduling software that prioritizes orders with shorter delivery times, resulting in deviations from the established plan. The simulation carried out with 189 orders totaling 4,991,667 units shows that this prioritization alters the initial plan, interrupts the production flow due to external interventions, and decreases overall efficiency. The results show an increase in production time from 5.19 to 5.67 days, a reduction in efficiency from 84% to 77%, and an increase in average delay from 2.56 to 3.3 days."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the impact of teaching indicators on the disposition of university biology students toward climate change mitigation. The research addresses a critical problem: despite the urgency of climate action, students in scientific fields often lack the pedagogical stimuli necessary to develop strong environmental commitment. A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional, and quantitative design was implemented, comparing an experimental group that received targeted instructional interventions with a control group. The sample included 429 students, and data was collected using a validated Likert-scale questionnaire composed of eight dimensions related to teaching strategies and climate disposition. The instrument showed high internal reliability (Cronbach’s $\\alpha=0.938$), sampling adequacy $(\\mathrm{KMO}=0.839)$, and a significant Bartlett’s test of sphericity ($\\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{2} =1591.059, \\mathrm{p}\\lt .001$). Statistical analysis using independent samples t-tests revealed significant differences ($\\mathrm{p}\\lt .001$) across all dimensions, with large effect sizes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and parallel analysis confirmed a two-component structure: the first related to teaching practices (planning, training, resources, methodologies), and the second to students’ climate-related dispositions (knowledge, attitude, commitment, perceived efficacy). These findings support the effectiveness of pedagogical indicators in fostering environmental responsibility. The study concludes that integrating climate-focused teaching strategies can significantly enhance students cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral readiness to act against climate change, reinforcing the importance of structured instructional design in higher education science programs. The eight evaluated dimensions were: teaching planning, use of teaching resources, teacher training on climate change, teaching methodologies, climate change knowledge, attitude toward climate mitigation, commitment to environmental action, and perception of educational efficacy."

Conventional validation relies on offline testing, such as the NIST SP 800-22 suite, which is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and unsuitable for runtime monitoring. This paper presents a lightweight hardware/software co-design framework on an AMD Zynq-7000 SoC that integrates a dynamically reconfigurable sampling clock, a Direct Memory Access based high-throughput acquisition pipeline, and an optimized subset of NIST SP 800-22 tests. TRNG outputs are evaluated on-chip by the embedded processor, enabling real-time pass/fail feedback and adaptive countermeasures such as frequency tuning. Experimental results demonstrate microsecond-scale reconfiguration latency across a from 5 MHz to 400 MHz sampling range, efficient resource utilization, and robust statistical validation. The proposed approach reduces reliance on offline evaluation, accelerates design cycles, and enhances resilience against environmental variations and active attacks, providing an energy-efficient platform for next-generation TRNG validation."

At the same time, the adoption of microservice-based architectures in the IoT domain is on the rise due to their ability to align with the swift evolution and deployment demands of highly dynamic IoT applications and to elastically scale to fulfill load demands. In complex environments like Fog federations, characterized by highly heterogeneous computing and networking resources, the effective allocation of microservices to available nodes, while ensuring compliance with required Quality of Service (QoS) constraints, represents a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of OptiFog, a comprehensive framework that enables users to model, simulate, and validate microservice placement solutions within a realistic testbed environment. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, OptiFog offers developers a controlled environment for experimenting with placement solutions while providing the assurance that the resulting deployments will meet the targeted QoS requirements in real-world scenarios, specifically in terms of service execution time and energy consumption of Fog nodes. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we implemented and evaluated a representative use case, involving both sub-optimal and optimal microservice placement, and utilizing real-world microservices drawn from the IoT domain."

    "abstract": "Scan-based tests achieve a high fault coverage efficiently but may fail to detect certain defects. Functional tests are used for providing additional defect coverage to complement scan-based tests. Using modeled faults, every fault that can be detected by a functional sequence can also be detected by a scan-based test. Therefore, in general, functional tests cannot directly target the test escapes of a scan-based test set. This article considers a specific scenario where such a direct connection exists. Under this common scenario, transition faults are detected by a scan-based test set that consists of two-cycle launch-on-capture (LOC) and launch-on-shift (LOS) tests with constant primary input vectors. The article suggests the use of functional tests, referred to as functional launch-on-capture (FLOC) tests, for detecting faults in the output cone of the primary inputs that cannot be detected when the primary input vectors are held constant. The resulting topoff procedure is implemented in an academic simulation environment. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate a higher than expected effectiveness in increasing the transition fault coverage for transition faults in the output cone of the primary inputs."

    "abstract": "Improving the resolution and reducing the complexity of beamforming play a critical role in achieving rapid and accurate acoustic source localization. In this paper, a compressive beamforming with Laplace norm joint constraint is proposed for acoustic source localization. Firstly, the localization problem is formulated as a joint sparse signal representation model, where the constraint function is Laplace norm since it can apply a strong sparsity penalty to improve the resolution. Secondly, a computational framework is specially designed for the single-snapshot model based on fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA), and then this framework is extended to multi-snapshot version through generalizing the soft shrinkage operator to row-vector shrinkage operator, with an adaptive regularization parameter setting method, proposing an algorithm referred to as LAFISTA. A series of simulations under various signal-to-noise ratios, source frequencies and snapshots are conducted, and results show that the resolution and robustness of the proposed algorithm are enhanced while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. Finally, real-world localization experiments demonstrate that LAFISTA can identify multiple sources accurately even in complex scenarios with unmanned aerial vehicle broadband noise and reverberation noise."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in connected vehicle (CV) technology have spurred research into CV-based realtime traffic signal control. However, existing studies still face challenges related to low penetration rates and low positioning accuracy in the current CV data environment. To address these challenges, we propose a CV-based adaptive traffic signal control framework for urban intersections, enhanced by leveraging the continuity of CV trajectories. The framework comprises an arrival-prediction component and a signal optimization component. By leveraging trajectory continuity to trace the travel information of CVs at upstream intersections, the arrival-prediction component restores the vehicle departure distributions, calibrates the platoon dispersion process, and predicts vehicle arrivals at the studied intersection over an extended period. The signal optimization component employs a rolling-horizon scheme for real-time signal timing optimization with the objective of minimizing the total delay, which is efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms actuated control even with a modest 5% penetration rate, particularly in medium- and high-volume scenarios. Under medium-volume scenarios with penetration rates of 0.05 and 0.2, the average vehicle delays are improved by 18.8% and 35.2%, respectively, compared to actuated control. This underscores the effectiveness of the framework in situations with limited CV data, i.e., low penetration rates and low positioning accuracy."

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) has moved on to a “2.0” level, where capability comes not only from better generators but from integrating generators with retrieval, tool use, and orchestration. The approach taken in this overview is a systems perspective, where a brief typology of families and of models is codified, along with a distillation of design patterns on how bare generators can be refined into reliable systems, namely containerized RAG, tool schemas, event-driven context, and conservative agent systems. In this position, we propose a practice-driven assessment perspective integrating task quality, along with Attribution, Robustness with respect to distribution shift & adversarial prompts, safety & governance (Privacy, IP, Provenance), and End-to-End Efficiency in Latency, Cost, & Energy. Text/Code, Vision-Language, Speech/Audio, Networks, Public Services, & Critical Infrastructure applications provide examples of these trends extending from benchmarking. The issues it brings to light include controllability and verifiability for long-range, multiple tool agents, scalable contamination aware assessment, traceability preserving data and model stewardship, as well as efficiency for resource-constrained and edge scenarios, while pointing towards near-term areas such as tool interface interoperability, traceability aware retrieval, lifecycle visibility, reporting card interoperability, and reliability assessment. Focusing on operational criteria, the research has contributed to creating a impact for making GenAI 2.0 Trustable AI. The blueprint can be utilized as a guide for future research."

    "abstract": "A Quality Control Management System (QCMS) is a critical tool that helps define and control the various processes by strategically monitoring established control targets and limits. These values are essential to providing products to end-use customers that meet or exceed their everyday needs and requirements. As with any QCMS, it is important to know the synergy that must exist between raw materials, process, and maintenance to balance production, cost, and customer expectations.This paper illustrates the development of a Process Control Improvement System (PCIS) tool which is a simplistic approach using the fundamental aspects of Quality and Process Control. The PCIS tool utilizes the principles of a \"Traffic Camera Light\" that captures the Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) for each stage of the process. It is capable of being incorporated into any Data Management System (DMS) that is used in the Laboratory and/or Process.The PCIS tool also provides descriptive statistics such as the Averages, Standard Deviation, Minimum, Maximum, Count and Conformity to various ranges, denoted as Green, Yellow, and Red. It can be auto emailed to the various plant management, which ultimately saves critical data analysis time. It provides key stake holders with both tabular, statistical, and graphical display summaries allowing for timely decision making to prevent issues from becoming problems thus reducing variability and driving continuous improvement initiatives.The PCIS tool is multi-faceted and has proven to be critical in extending quarry reserves, reducing raw material costs, optimizing alternative and natural fuels, predicting potential process and maintenance issues, preventing environmental emission concerns, and producing consistent quality products."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the proportion of labeled data on the performance of semi-supervised learning models for the classification of volcanic micro-seismic events. This work utilizes a dataset of over 22,000 micro-earthquake records from the Cotopaxi Volcano, with extracted features from time, frequency, and scale domains. Two semi-supervised approaches are implemented: Self-Training, using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB) as base classifiers; and L abel Spreading, based on graph-based label propagation. Model performance is evaluated using two primary metrics: the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) and F1-score. The SVM Self-Training model achieved the highest results, with an AUC of 0.9575 and an F1-score of 0.9472 when trained with 90% of labeled data. The RF model also performed robustly, particularly in noisy or imbalanced scenarios, reaching an AUC of 0.9505 and an F1-score of 0.9436. In contrast, NB showed limited gains, and the Label Spreading model failed to improve with more labeled data, stabilizing at an AUC around 0.88. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SVM and RF in leveraging unlabeled data for seismic event classification under varying label scarcity conditions."

To validate the constructed orthosis, tests were carried out in controlled environments, obtaining a mechanical design that can be adapted to the morphology of the hand. The orthosis also has a control system that guarantees the precision of the programmed movements. This research provides a solid basis for the design of adaptive medical devices and paves the way for the development of similar technologies in the field of rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Automated recognition of animal species from images remains a central challenge in computer vision with applications in ecological monitoring, veterinary diagnostics, and livestock management. Conventional convolutional architectures exhibit limited robustness when confronted with heterogeneous data and visually similar classes, resulting in reduced inter-class separability. To address this limitation, three representative deep learning models were examined: a custom convolutional network, a deep residual network, ResNet50, and a transformer-based ViT-B16. All models were trained under identical conditions with standardized normalization, extensive augmentation, and uniform optimization. Comparative evaluation established a clear stratification of performance. The custom network achieved only moderate accuracy with pronounced misclassification between similar categories. ResNet50 demonstrated substantial improvements and more stable generalization, though residual ambiguities persisted. ViT-B16 consistently outperformed both convolutional models, achieving class-wise F1-scores above 0.90 and true positive rates exceeding 0.95 for most categories. The findings provide rigorous evidence of the superiority of transformer-based architectures for fine-grained image recognition."

USSF employs two novel mechanisms: (1) artifact-based indexing (APP, SCR, DIA, FRM, CMP, WID) to represent application elements in hierarchical form and (2) inheritance with override rules for systematically applying and adapting standards across different levels of user interface elements. The framework enables traceability, scalability and methodological clarity, supporting both usability evaluation and future integration with automated design tools. The USSF could acts as a composite high-level standard that integrates existing standards, principle, heuristics, established usability and accessibility guidelines into a unified model. An illustrative example demonstrates the framework’s applicability, while a discussion highlights its benefits, limitations and potential for empirical validation. The USSF thus provides a novel contribution to human-computer interaction by bridging established guidelines and enabling standardized, traceable and adaptable screen design."

We introduce Spark, a coding exercise monitoring dashboard designed to address these challenges. Spark allows instructors to flexibly group substeps into checkpoints based on exercise requirements, suggests automated tests for these checkpoints, and generates visualizations to track progress across steps. Spark also allows instructors to inspect intermediate outputs, providing deeper insights into solution variations. We also construct a dataset of 40 -minute keystroke coding data from $\\mathrm{N}=22$ learners solving two web programming exercises and provide empirical insights into the perceived usefulness of Spark through a within-subjects evaluation with $\\mathbf{1 6}$ programming instructors.

    "abstract": "Facial expressions have been studied by professionals in psychology, medicine, law, marketing, art, and sociology. and thanks to technological advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, a facial emotion recognition system has been developed to determine the effectiveness of predicting whether a worker is experiencing work-related stress, by comparing the results with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which measures work-related stress in its three main dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal fulfillment. Free tools were used and Amazon web services routines designed exclusively for facial emotion recognition were integrated, and an XP methodology was applied for software development. With a population of 25 people who initially assessed their levels of work-related stress, using software that automates MBI, samples were taken over 20 working days using the facial emotion recognition system. Participants were free to determine the number of samples they took during this period, with the instruction that it should be done during the working day, obtaining a total of 260 samples. A Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to the results, obtaining an $\\mathrm{r}=0.25$, which indicates a low linear relationship between the MBI and the indices derived from AI; This leads to the conclusion that the facial recognition system shows that technology alone cannot capture the complexity of work-related stress, confirming that numbers and objects or pure technological measurements, even with artificial intelligence and algorithms, are insufficient for diagnosing mental health if the cognitive, affective, interactional, and contextual spheres are not considered in order to understand the complexity of human beings."

    "abstract": "Urban land-use conflicts often arise from overlapping ecological, demographic, and economic pressures, making them difficult to resolve through conventional statistical approaches. These methods struggle to separate the causal impacts of policy interventions from confounding socioeconomic factors. This paper proposes a methodological framework that integrates Structural Causal Models (SCM) with Double Machine Learning (DML) to estimate the causal effects of land-use policies on urban land dynamics. The framework employs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to formalize causal assumptions and applies back-door adjustment with DML to achieve robust effect estimation under complex confounding. Empirical results show that land tenure types substantially influence the probability of conflict, and these effects are further moderated by demographic and ecological heterogeneity. Beyond the empirical findings, the study illustrates how SCM+DML functions as a form of computational intelligence, combining adaptive learning with causal reasoning to strengthen policy evaluation. The contribution is twofold: (1) methodologically, it advances causal inference approaches in high-dimensional urban policy settings, and (2) practically, it provides actionable insights for policymakers to design more adaptive, transparent, and evidence-based land-use regulations"

Manual quality assessment remains subjective and inefficient, highlighting the need for an automated system. This study proposes a digital image processing approach for classifying chili pepper quality using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Three feature types were extracted from chili pepper images: texture features using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and color features using Hue Saturation Value (HSV). A dataset of 1,200 primary images representing six quality categories (raw, half-ripe, ripe, dry, rotten, and anthracnose) was used. The images underwent preprocessing including background removal, resizing, and augmentation. Experimental results show that the combination of LBP, GLCM, and HSV features achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of $95.83 \\%$, precision of 0.9586, recall of 0.9583, and $\\mathbf{F 1}$-score of 0.9581. The optimal XGBoost parameters were a learning rate of $0.1,100$ estimators, and a maximum depth of 12. These findings demonstrate that integrating color and texture features effectively enhances chili pepper quality classification accuracy."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of numerous photovoltaic systems, attention has been drawn to the potential impact these may have on the stability of voltage in electricity distribution networks. This is the focus of the present study, which aims to examine the relationship that may exist between voltage fluctuations in electricity transmission networks and the variation in the photovoltaic system production. To this end, two separate databases of a specific geographical area are processed and combined. These relate respectively to the output of photovoltaic parks in amperes and the grid voltage in kilovolts, for a period of one year. The above databases were merged into a single file, and then analyzed using various approaches, such as correlation analysis, the use of a scatter plot, time series analysis and regression analysis, specifically linear regression. All the above was done in Python programming language. Finally, the research findings were summarized and presented to contribute to improved knowledge of this subject."

    "abstract": "The snake fruit export farming community in Sleman, Yogyakarta, experienced a decline in production in 2023 due to fruit fly infestations. Control efforts were carried out using the Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management (AWIPM) approach by installing methyl eugenol-based pheromone traps, with effectiveness measured using the Flies per Trap per Day (FTD) indicator. Since the fruit fly-counting process is still performed manually and is time-consuming, this study proposes an image-based automatic counting system to improve monitoring efficiency and accuracy. A comparative analysis was conducted on five deep-learning-based object detection models, YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and Fast R-CNN, using a public fruit fly dataset. Six different training schemes were applied to the YOLO models, whereas Fast R-CNN was trained using an iterative approach. Based on the evaluation results, YOLOv5 demonstrated the best and most balanced performance, achieving a precision of 0.944, recall of 0.947, and mAP of 0.946. Its architecture, which incorporates Leaky ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions along with the CSPDarknet backbone, enables efficient feature extraction and real-time object detection. Therefore, YOLOv5 was selected as the primary model for developing an accurate and lightweight fruit fly detection and counting system to support farmers and regulatory reporting."

    "abstract": "As the number of wireless devices has grown exponentially, there is a great challenge for identifying large quantities of transmitters with high accuracy. Radio frequency (RF) fingerprint identification is a powerful tool for wireless device identification, also called as specific emitter identification (SEI). There is nearly no research about the sufficient integration of domain knowledge with deep networks among the existing SEI methods, limiting the accurate identification of large amount of transmitters quickly. A novel deep fusion SEI approach with domain knowledge and improved residual network is proposed. The domain knowledge is integrated to highlight the differences among emitters. An improved residual network with simplified layers and attention mechanism is proposed to further characterize the subtle and deep fingerprints with high efficiency. The real-world large datasets are utilized and the proposed method has superior performance of identifying large number of emitters with high accuracy of 96.63% for 60 emitters and 94.46% for 139 emitters. Through numerous of comparative experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed method has higher accuracy, fewer parameters, less running time comparing to the State-of-Art studies."

    "abstract": "Lightweight smoke image segmentation is essential for fire warning systems, particularly on mobile devices. In recent years, although numerous high-precision, large-scale smoke segmentation models have been developed, there are few lightweight solutions specifically designed for mobile applications. Therefore, we propose a Multi-stage Group Interaction and Cross-domain Fusion Network (MGICFN) with low computational complexity for real-time smoke segmentation. To improve the model’s ability to effectively analyze smoke features, we incorporate a Cross-domain Interaction Attention Module (CIAM) to merge spatial and frequency domain features for creating a lightweight smoke encoder. To alleviate the loss of critical information from small smoke objects during downsampling, we design a Multi-stage Group Interaction Module (MGIM). The MGIM calibrates the information discrepancies between high and low-dimensional features. To enhance the boundary information of smoke targets, we introduce an Edge Enhancement Module (EEM), which utilizes predicted target boundaries as advanced guidance to refine lower-level smoke features. Furthermore, we implement a Group Convolutional Block Attention Module (GCBAM) and a Group Fusion Module (GFM) to connect the encoder and decoder efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that MGICFN achieves an 88.70% Dice coefficient (Dice), an 81.16% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and a 91.93% accuracy (Acc) on the SFS3K dataset. It also achieves an 87.30% Dice, a 78.68% mIoU, and a 92.95% Acc on the SYN70K test dataset. Our MGICFN model has 0.73M parameters and requires 0.3G FLOPs."

However, existing benchmarks on face anti-spoofing mainly focus on RGB images, further challenged by consistently developed 3D high-fidelity (HiFi) masks. To facilitate the research on multimodal face anti-spoofing, we construct the HyperSpectral Face Anti-Spoofing (HySpeFAS) dataset. We introduce the newly-developed snapshot spectral imaging (SSI) technology to capture real and spoof faces, as well as identify unknown HiFi masks. Specifically, hyperspectral images (HSIs) acquired by SSI sensor contain rich information about the chemical composition of the targets, which can be used to effectively distinguish live human skin and various spoof materials. The HySpeFAS dataset contains 22,368 multimodal images (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e</i>., RGB, SSI, HSI) of 17 live subjects and 60 spoof subjects. Moreover, extensive experiments with baseline deep learning models validate the special features of the SSI images and the potential of SSI in FAS. By publishing the dataset as well as the baseline models, we encourage the community to foster the algorithm study associated with hyperspectral images and the development of SSI-equipped intelligent systems."

    "abstract": "Robotic automation in high-mix, low-volume settings often relies on structured workcells where fixtures, workpieces, and procedures are well defined, but tasks must be reconfigured quickly across variants. This paper presents the Design and Learning Research Group's solution to the euROBIN Manipulation Skill Versatility Challenge (MSVC) at IROS 2024, in which a standardized electronic task board is operated through a fixed sequence of subtasks. We deliberately adopt a simple, industry-style implementation: each subtask is taught by recording an open-loop Tool Center Point (TCP) and gripper trajectory in the task-board frame, a wrist-mounted depth camera is used once per run to localize the board and a few key features, and a web dashboard exposes the resulting motion primitives as reusable code blocks that can be reordered and reparameterized. With this pipeline, our system completes the benchmark in 28.2 s in the lab (37.2 s on-site), compared to a human baseline of 16.3 s and an average of 83.5 s for previous teams, closing a large part of the performance gap without advanced learning or feedback control. We further demonstrate limited skill transfer by retargeting the same subtask library to a smoke-detector battery replacement scenario required by the competition. Finally, we release our implementation as open source and discuss how competition design and benchmark structure influence the balance between simple engineered solutions and richer sensing and learning."

    "abstract": "Scanning magnets are devices responsible for deflecting particles to specific locations in particle therapy utilizing spot-scanning techniques. To maintain scanned beam-spot distortion at the isocenter plane within an acceptable threshold, sufficient field-integral homogeneity must be guaranteed in both transverse dimensions across the good field region. Typically, this is accomplished by adding shims on both sides of magnet poles. In this study, we innovatively proposed a method for multi-objective optimization of shim parameters and excitation currents using the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III), to facilitate an efficient optimization process. After that, beam tracking has been employed to assess the beam-spot distortion. By implementing these methods, we successfully developed an optimal Y-axis scanning magnet (SMY) using hybrid-laminated silicon steels. Designed for a fast scanning speed of up to 80 mm/ms, this magnet can deliver a 400 MeV/u carbon-ion beam to cover a 20 cm × 20 cm irradiation field at a source-to-axis distance (SAD) of 255 cm. Compared to the manually tuned SMY configuration, the automated optimization process achieved a 78.80% homogeneity enhancement in the good field region at the midplane. This advanced high-performance magnet, designed for integration with the next-generation lightweight superconducting rotating gantry, is a pioneering accelerator magnet developed through intelligent algorithm-driven optimization. Static magnetic field measurements conclusively demonstrate the manufacturability of this genetically optimized magnet within existing CNC machining frameworks, and show good agreement with simulation results. Furthermore, the development of the X-axis scanning magnet (SMX) is also discussed."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) rely on self–attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large–scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: crossstage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage computetation and memory–efficient algorithm–hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2× speedup and 71.2× energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1× energy and 27.1× area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1× throughput improvement."

Combining multiple available voice databases could address these limitations, but the differences between databases are poorly understood. In this work, differences across pathological voice databases are analysed using Linear Mixed Models and Mutual Information scores. Results reveal significant differences between databases. These differences are caused by inconsistent recording protocols and population sampling, leading to differing lengths of recordings, values of features and noticeable differences in articulation. Consequently, while training on a single database limits generalizability, simply combining databases is not a straightforward solution. Found results indicate that unless these inherent differences are explicitly accounted for, models will fail to perform well on any new data, regardless of the number of source databases used."

A modular embedded control architecture was developed using microcontrollers, enabling independent actuation of brakes, encoder signal acquisition, and PWM-based motor control. The system was interfaced with the Robot Operating System (ROS) to facilitate real-time communication and control via the rosserial protocol. A fuzzy logic controller was implemented to manage joint positioning without relying on precise dynamic modeling, enhancing robustness and adaptability. Additionally, a digital twin of the manipulator was selected among V-REP (CoppeliaSim) models, allowing bi-directional synchronization between the virtual model and physical hardware.

    "abstract": "Public procurement accounts for nearly a third of Ecuador’s public spending and is a critical vector for corruption. In response to this challenge, this work presents an earlywarning framework that predicts corruption risk in Ecuador’s Reverse Electronic Auction (REA) processes. Specifically, we extend the Kapak transparency platform by constructing a stagebased dataset ($2020-2023$) of 2,000 REA contracts, integrating 12 binary red-flag indicators and 20 structural features per stage. Corruption risk is operationalized as a four-level label derived from a composite indicator built on quartile thresholds. To address this predictive task, we formulate prediction as a multi-class classification task and benchmark Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting across three decision points: (i) Stage 1: Questions-Answers-Clarifications, (ii) Stage 2: Pending Award, and (iii) Stage 3: Contract Execution. Across all stages, Gradient Boosting consistently ranks first, achieving macro-F1/AUC-ROC scores of 0.60/0.84 in Stage 1, 0.61/0.85 in Stage 2, and 0.79/0.94 in Stage 3, with performance gains confirmed by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (threshold $\\boldsymbol{\\lt } \\mathbf{0. 0 5}$). Notably, high-risk contracts are the easiest to discern (AUC up to 0.91), while medium-risk levels remain challenging. Furthermore, feature-importance analysis reveals that clarifications with restrictive language, late contract publication, and post-award document changes are among the strongest predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that meaningful corruption-risk signals are detectable well before contract execution, enabling oversight bodies to allocate investigative resources proactively and enhance procurement integrity in emerging economies."

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted using the Kitchenham method, involving 30 peer-reviewed articles published between 2019 and 2025. Studies were assessed based on methodological rigor, theoretical foundation, and relevance to $\\mathbf{L O}$ domains. The findings reveal that cognitive outcomes are predominantly measured through quantitative tools, while affective and behavioral aspects are addressed through qualitative and formative assessments. Mixed-methods approaches are most effective in capturing the full spectrum of student achievement. Visual tools such as heatmaps and topic networks were used to illustrate variable relationships and evaluation trends. Notably, only a limited number of studies address $\\mathbf{L O}$ evaluation in online and distance learning environments, and these often lack depth in capturing affective engagement and behavioral change.

These configurations are error-prone and require substantial expertise, posing a barrier to novices. In this paper, we introduce PipeBlocks, a block-based CI/CD tool featuring a graphical interface for visually constructing pipelines through modular, drag-and-drop blocks. PipeBlocks seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions, allowing users to design, validate, and execute pipelines entirely within the tool while maintaining full compatibility with existing YAML workflows. A key innovation is the ability to trigger and monitor pipeline runs directly in PipeBlocks, eliminating context-switching. We evaluated PipeBlocks through a controlled study with 10 participants configuring identical pipelines (build, test, deploy) using both PipeBlocks and YAML editing in GitHub Actions. Using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA-TLX benchmarks, we found that PipeBlocks achieved a statistically significantly higher usability score and a lower cognitive load. The results suggest that block-based approaches can effectively lower CI/CD’s learning curve while maintaining functional completeness, making them particularly valuable for academic settings and early-career developers building CI/CD competencies."

The antenna exhibits a stable peak realized gain ranging from 2.84 to 9.59 decibels and a high radiation efficiency exceeding 86.38 percent throughout the band. A detailed analysis of the simulated E-plane and H-plane radiation patterns at key resonant frequencies (4.46, 7.68, 10.21, 12.47, 17.04, 19.67, and 21.13 gigahertz) reveals a versatile evolution of directional characteristics, transitioning from broad coverage at lower frequencies to more focused and complex patterns at higher frequencies. This adaptability makes the antenna a promising candidate for diverse military applications, including broadband tactical communications, electronic warfare, surveillance radar, and precision-tracking systems, offering a multifunctional solution for modern military platforms."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the formulation of digital models for assessing traction network-generated electromagnetic fields (EMF) in environments containing large metallic portals, specifically overpasses. A key outcome of the modeling is the pronounced distortion of the spatial EMF distribution by large conductive structures, which transforms the field from a plane-parallel regime into a fully three-dimensional one. The underlying numerical approach employs a mesh of finite-length segments to represent the entire system, including aerial and grounded elements. The spatial dimensions of this mesh were deliberately confined to a scale of several hundred meters, a necessary condition for upholding the quasi-stationary field assumption at frequencies up to 2 kHz. The implemented system model included an equivalent power supply generator, a 40 MVA traction substation, and a 10-km double-track section of a 25 kV traction network utilizing a PBSM-95 + MF-100 catenary suspension. Analysis of the simulation data provided the longitudinal profiles of EMF strength amplitudes and their constituent components, followed by the construction of three-dimensional field distribution maps to elucidate the spatial characteristics of the electromagnetic environment. The study results indicate that the presented method successfully incorporates the effect of metal structures in traction network EMF modeling. Its practical application can contribute to the design of enhanced electromagnetic safety protocols."

    "abstract": "One challenge in technical interviews is the thinkaloud process, where candidates verbalize their thought processes while solving coding tasks. Despite its importance, opportunities for structured practice remain limited. Conversational AI offers potential assistance, but limited research explores user perceptions of its role in think-aloud practice. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 17 participants using an LLM-based technical interview practice tool. Participants valued AI’s role in simulation, feedback, and learning from generated examples. Key design recommendations include promoting social presence in conversational AI for technical interview simulation, providing feedback beyond verbal content analysis, and enabling crowdsourced think-aloud examples through humanAI collaboration. Beyond feature design, we examined broader considerations, including intersectional challenges and potential strategies to address them, how AI-driven interview preparation could promote equitable learning in computing careers, and the need to rethink AI’s role in interview practice by suggesting a research direction that integrates human-AI collaboration."

While automated content moderation has received considerable attention, user-driven counterspeech remains a less explored yet promising approach. However, many people face difficulties in crafting effective responses. We introduce CounterQuill, a human-AI collaborative system that helps everyday users with writing empathetic counterspeech-not by generating automatic replies, but by educating them through reflection and response. CounterQuill follows a three-stage workflow grounded in computational thinking: (1) a learning session to build understanding of hate speech and counterspeech, (2) a brainstorming session to identify harmful patterns and ideate counterspeech ideas, and (3) a co-writing session that helps users refine their counter responses while preserving personal voice. Through a user study ($\\mathbf{N} \\boldsymbol{=} \\mathbf{2 0}$), we found that CounterQuill helped participants develop the skills to brainstorm and draft counterspeech with confidence and control throughout the process. Our findings highlight how AI systems can scaffold complex communication tasks through structured, human-centered workflows that educate users on how to recognize, reflect on, and respond to online hate speech."

    "abstract": "Ecuador’s electronic filing platform (SATJE) routinely exposes litigants’ full identifiers and sensitive information, undermining the constitutional guarantees of privacy and personal-data protection. To measure the scale of the problem, we reviewed all 933 constitutional filings lodged in 2023 before Quito’s North Judicial Complex, isolated the 270 petitions granted at first instance, and examined 78 digital case files-treating each judicial tier as a separate analytical unit. We coded every docket, classified disclosures into seven statutory categories, and recorded their anonymization status. Of the 78 evaluable files, 94.9% contained no anonymization whatsoever. Names, identity numbers and sensitive particulars persisted across the record; data concerning disability appeared in 33.3% of cases and information on minors in 25.6%, whereas asset data were rare (2.6%). All instances of anonymization—partial or total-concerned minors only. These findings show that Ecuador’s digital-justice architecture privileges transparency over privacy, leaving personal data perpetually exposed to every online visitor. We argue that a judiciary-wide anonymization protocol, implemented by designated data-protection officers, is now imperative. Default suppression of personal data offers the most viable route to reconcile open-justice ideals with constitutional obligations and to restore public trust in electronic justice."

The laboratory integrates Cisco and MikroTik devices with VLAN segmentation, OSPF dynamic routing, and GRE-based VPN tunnels, enabling advanced hands-on training without additional hardware. Comprehensive performance tests confirmed an average OSPF convergence time of 7.2 seconds and a 35% reduction in inter-branch latency compared with OSPF-only routing. Resource consumption remained stable, operating with 3.2 GB of RAM and less than $50 \\& \\mathrm{CPU}$ utilization on mid-range hardware. These results validate the scalability, reproducibility, and cost-effectiveness of the proposed architecture, offering an estimated USD $\\mathbf{1 2, 0 0 0}$ savings compared with an equivalent physical setup.

This study introduces AJI, a cloud-native application integrated with machine learning to automate and secure attendance and payroll processes. The system is designed with a cloud-native architecture that ensures scalability, security, and cost efficiency. For employee identification, the application employs facial recognition technology using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN). Employee attendance data is directly linked to an automated payroll system that accounts for attendance, overtime, and lateness. The backend infrastructure utilizes Google Cloud services, including Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage. The model was trained on 2,800 facial images and achieved a testing accuracy of 98.80\\%. Deployment through Cloud Run resulted in an average response time of 1 second for facial verification requests. Compared to similar applications, AJI offers an integrated, automated solution specifically designed for MSMEs, emphasizing data accuracy, operational transparency, and user-friendliness. This research aims to enhance operational efficiency and minimize manual errors in human resource management systems for MSMEs. Future enhancements may include multi-language support and broader application in sectors like healthcare and education."

However, the rapid increase in publications has led to fragmentation that makes it difficult to identify clear trends, thematic gaps, and emerging research areas. This situation limits the development of focused studies and hinders interdisciplinary collaboration in fields such as mental health, education, and social media analysis. The aim of this study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis to map the scientific evolution of NLP research applied to human behavior, highlighting key topics, collaboration networks, and future research directions. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a final corpus of 22 articles from the Scopus database (2010-2024) was analyzed using the Bibliometrix software package for quantitative analysis. The results reveal a steady growth in scientific output, with a thematic concentration in sentiment analysis, digital mental health, and emotion detection. Strong collaboration networks were identified in North America, Europe, and Asia, although low participation from regions in Latin America and Africa was noted. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, highlighting research opportunities and the need to develop explainable and ethically auditable models to guide future interdisciplinary work."

Over a continuous six-month evaluation at Dr. Gustavo Domínguez Z Hospital, the system demonstrated high operational reliability with uptime levels consistently ranging from $99.95 \\%$ to $99.99 \\%$ and an average availability of 99.97 %. Recovery times remained below six minutes even during critical events, and no clinical data loss was recorded. The storage utilization increased from $12.1 \\%$ to $18.0 \\%$ during the period, reflecting a progressive integration into clinical workflows and strong user adoption. The use of Synology Hybrid RAID contributed to optimal data integrity, achieving $100 \\%$ in most months and 99.99 % during isolated events.

    "abstract": "Data governance plays a central role in ensuring the success of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) migrations by influencing data quality, regulatory compliance, and overall organizational performance. Despite its importance, many institutions embark on major system transitions without adequately assessing their governance readiness, leading to costly disruptions, data integrity issues, and increased compliance risks. To address this gap, this study proposes a six-pillar data governance framework that integrates key dimensions such as data ownership, stewardship, quality management, security, compliance, and lifecycle control. Complementing the framework, a prototype readiness assessment tool was developed using HTML and Python Flask to evaluate institutional governance maturity levels prior to migration. The tool produces readiness scores and tailored feedback, enabling organizations to identify weaknesses and prioritize improvement areas. Comparative case analyses across higher education, healthcare, and financial sectors reveal common governance deficiencies, including fragmented data ownership and inconsistent quality standards, alongside sector-specific challenges shaped by regulatory demands and legacy infrastructures. By combining conceptual modeling with prototype validation, this research offers a practical and adaptable approach to enhancing governance maturity and reducing migration risks. The findings contribute to both academic and practitioner discussions on digital transformation readiness, offering actionable guidance for achieving sustainable ERP outcomes across diverse institutional contexts."

    "abstract": "The development of robotics technology is increasingly penetrating everyday life, including simple activities such as delivering goods. Activities that are done repeatedly can take up a lot of energy and time. This need drives this research: designing a delivery robot that can move independently, recognize its environment, and intelligently avoid obstacles. The robot developed combines odometry from a rotary encoder sensor to determine position, mechanum wheels to enable flexible movement in all directions, and an omnidirectional camera that reads the color of objects using the HSV color space. The system is equipped with PID control to keep the robot’s movements stable and accurate. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of odometry, PID control, and HSV-based vision into a single, low-cost yet effective solution for small-scale logistics and urban applications. The robot not only moves but also learns to “understand” its path to the destination. Odometry tests show that the robot can reach its destination with a relatively small average error of $\\mathbf{1}-\\mathbf{2} \\boldsymbol{\\%}$. When tested on a 1360 mm track, the integration of PID control significantly improved movement stability, reducing directional errors to almost zero. Meanwhile, the HSV-based vision system successfully distinguished between green paths, red targets, and white obstacles with consistent accuracy, even in varying lighting conditions. The synergy of these three methods enables the robot to move more smoothly, precisely, and adaptively. Beyond its technical contributions, this research also aligns with Indonesia’s SDGs (SDGs 8, 9, and 11) by enhancing productivity, fostering innovation, and supporting sustainable urban logistic"

Classical models like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) face limitations in handling non-linear behavior and long-term dependencies in time series. To address these limitations, this study develops and evaluates a forecasting framework by comparing the performance of classical statistical methods, deep learning models, and ensemble techniques. The comparison includes ARIMA as the baseline, alongside Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models with different architectural configurations (1, 2, and 3 layers) using lag 1 and lag 7, and the proposed Deep Stacking Ensemble Learning model with its meta-learner using Support Vector Regression (SVR). The models performance was assessed on the testing dataset using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The Deep Stacking Ensemble outperforms LSTM and ARIMA, with lag 1 being most robust (MAPE 0.098%) and lag 7 more accurate than ARIMA (MAPE 0.126%). This study concludes that the deep stacking ensemble method improves forecasting accuracy and reliability by integrating multiple models, making it suitable for highly fluctuating time series."

In the case of CREATEM S.A.C. is a manufacturing MSE dedicated to the fabrication of replacement parts for motorized vehicles that present a low OTIF of 47.45% very low compared to the standard which is 80%. Currently, the metal-mechanic sector represents a 11% of the manufacturing industry and the MSEs cover a 99.2% of the total companies in Peru. However, the majority of that have problems with adequate inventory control of the raw material. To this end, in order to reduce its economic impact as a solution, a comprehensive DDMRP and Machine Learning model is proposed to forecast the demand and manage the inventory dynamically. After the validation of the model, we obtained an improvement of the OTIF of 79.45%, as well as a reduction in the stock out rate to 8.2%. The proposal proved to be robust to lead time variations and demand peaks thanks to the buffers adjustment. It not only improved CREATEM logistics performance but also contributed strategically to position Peruvian automotive MSEs as a catalysts of the Latin American Hub."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across industries and are poised to drive low-altitude economy (LAE), where effective cooperation is key to unlocking their full potential. Given the open and interconnected nature of LAE networks, UAV cooperation introduces privacy risks that may undermine trust and collaboration. Protecting sensitive information, such as locations, flight trajectories, and proprietary operational data, is essential to ensure secure and reliable coordination. The disclosure of this information could expose a UAV to attacks or disruptions. This article presents a novel privacy-preserving UAV cooperation framework designed to create a privacy-conscious networking environment and promote collaborative UAV operations for LAE. The framework specifically addresses privacy concerns inherent in collaborative UAV missions by safeguarding origin points, destinations, and trajectories. This is achieved through destination obfuscation and a non-cooperative Bayesian game approach for trajectory planning, wherein each UAV only shares the probabilistic distribution of its potential waypoints at different times. The best response strategy is established to guarantee a Nash equilibrium regarding the trajectories. Simulations demonstrate the framework’s capability to ensure timely UAV arrivals, while preserving trajectory and location privacy. Even under moderate obfuscation the algorithm maintains over 90% of the optimal energy performance, highlighting its resilience to privacy-preserving perturbations."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the adaptive optimal enclosure control problem for multi-spacecraft systems surrounding a noncooperative target. Based on the orbital dynamics derived from the two-body problem, a manifold-based invariant estimation method is developed to accurately reconstruct the unknown control input of the target. Subsequently, a dynamic model of relative orbital error is established to formulate the enclosure control objective. An adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) approach utilizing a single critic neural network is proposed to approximate the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation online. To alleviate onboard computational burdens, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism incorporating a dynamic state regulator (DSR) and an auxiliary threshold modulator (ATM) is designed, which actively adjusts the triggering threshold to balance triggering frequency and control accuracy. Thus, an event-driven weight update law is further introduced, significantly reducing the update rate while maintaining satisfactory approximation performance. The resulting optimal control law ensures precise enclosure formation with guaranteed stability. The uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven via Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control strategy."

Since the product of voltage, current and time defines electrical energy, breaking them down into the smallest quantities feasible (viable and suitable in the context of the state-of-the-art of power electronics devices and systems) enables processing power through processing small energy quanta. A discussion is provided to justify that this, in principle, could bring substantial benefits in terms of standardization, modularity, scalability, flexibility, versatility, efficiency, power density, reliability, cost, and other performance features at system level. That is, this paper shares a vision of future power electronics systems as built from a single standardized and optimized low-voltage and low-current power semiconductor switch rather than from a number of different switches at different voltage and current ratings. One of the possible paths to implement these power processing techniques is through the use of switching cell arrays, where switching components are not mixed with energy storing components, potentially leading to high levels of integration."

    "abstract": "Chirp-based multicarrier waveforms, notably the generalized version, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) have garnered increased attention recently. Particularly, due to its unique channel representation, the channel estimation (CE) in the affine domain raises major challenges. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel, low-complexity CE technique that exploits the properties of chirp carriers in the post-coded time-domain (PCTD). Initially, based on the explicit input-output relationship in doubly selective channels, the inherent properties of AFDM and their dependency on the refining coefficients are analyzed, revealing the limitations of existing guard-based CE techniques. As such, a comprehensive representation of single and multiple chirp carriers in the PCTD is provided both pre- and post-channel transmission, with a focus on interpreting the effects of delay and Doppler shifts. Building on this analysis, a two-stage CE method is proposed, leveraging the zero-padded PCTD (ZP-PCTD) received signal, effectively decoupling delay and Doppler components with scalable resolution. This method effectively compensates for phase selectivity across carriers while maintaining adaptability through scenario-based frame structures with optimized pilot-to-data ratios. The proposed approach significantly reduces the computational complexity and improves spectral efficiency (SE) by minimizing pilot overhead. Simulation results reflect the superiority of the proposed method over the existing iterative schemes, highlighting its ability to improve the performance of AFDM in practical propagation channels."

    "abstract": "The credibility of the perception system is a linchpin for the safety of Automated Vehicles (AVs). However, existing scenario-based testing approaches often overlook the reliability assessment of the perception system. To address this shortcoming, we propose BAGA, a Bayesian-based adaptive search method for high-value scenarios, which accelerates scenario-based simulations while identifying critical scenarios for the perception system. Concurrently, we design a sensitivity analysis method, BNSobol, based on the naive Bayes network. This method decouples the associations among selected trigger source sets and develops a mutation strategy that aligns with the physical characteristics of the perception system. Furthermore, we construct an objective function that integrates the tolerance boundaries of the credibility indicators. This function calculates the perception system's credibility within scenarios and identifies high-value scenarios. Ultimately, we develop integrated software for evaluating the credibility of the perception system, providing a universal solution for such assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to mainstream scenario generation methods and exhaustive search methods, our proposed method increases efficiency by 77.7% and 143.2%, respectively. It can effectively generate the high-value scenarios required for perception system testing, thereby facilitating the discovery and localization of credibility issues."

    "abstract": "Compared with monotherapy, combination drug therapy plays a crucial role in clinical treatment. However, the exponential expansion of the drug combination space has rendered traditional exploration methods for synergistic drug combinations inadequate. Recently, numerous efficient and accurate computational approaches have been developed to predict anticancer drug synergy, particularly those leveraging hypergraphs to model the multifaceted relationships between drug combinations and cell lines, which have demonstrated remarkable potential. Nevertheless, existing hypergraph-based methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of anticancer synergy hypergraphs and overlook the underlying similarities among drugs and cell lines, thereby limiting their ability to fully capture the complex interactions between drug combinations and cell lines. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Heterogeneous Hypergraph Representation Learning Method (HHGSynergy) for predicting anticancer drug synergy, enabling more precise identification of synergistic drug combinations. Specifically, our framework first constructs drug/cell line similarity-based synergy hypergraphs based on the foundational anticancer synergy hypergraph, thereby establishing a comprehensive heterogeneous hypergraph. Next, a node importance calculation module is employed to learn both local and global importance weights of nodes, effectively capturing the structural characteristics of the hypergraph. Finally, a type-specific multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to iteratively update node embeddings, adaptively learning the significance of heterogeneous hyperedges. Experimental results demonstrate that HHGSynergy achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and regression tasks across diverse experimental scenarios, outperforming existing leading models. Case studies further underscore its potential for discovering novel synergistic drug combinations.

Our methodology integrates multiple radio frequency performance metrics and considers the direction of the drive test as a user device moves between cells. Traditional DoA estimation methods, limited by the inherent sparsity of downlink (DL) channel structures in mobile systems, often incur high computational complexity and do not fully leverage available radio frequency measurements. To address these challenges, we propose three relative DoA estimation methods utilizing linear regression equations, neural networks, and a gain-based formula. These methods are designed to be compact and efficient, m aking t hem w ell-suited f or i mplementation on user devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the neural network method achieves superior accuracy in estimating relative DoA compared to other approaches, under both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions in real outdoor mobile environments. Notably, the neural network model achieved the best RMSE value of $9.7 \\%$, underscoring its effectiveness. This approach highlights a promising path for reducing DoA estimation complexity in mobile communication systems."

After reviewing original articles, a comprehensive account was completed for bioactive compounds as terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, saponins, and furanocoumarins that have shown multiple mechanisms of action, including damage to the fungal membrane, inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, promotion of reactive oxygen species formation, and blockage of essential metabolic pathways. Quantitative data on minimum inhibitory concentrations, zones of inhibition, minimum fungicidal concentration, and synergies with classical antifungals, are also discussed. The findings reveal that these plant species, which are commonly available in the local markets, are promising sources to produce natural antifungal products in medicine and agriculture. The data also show that some of these species may potentially provide a valuable new source of bioactive compounds for sustainable therapeutic or phytosanitary use. This review represents a reference for future studies related to the isolation, structural elucidation, toxicology studies, and clinical application of these compounds."

The hybrid architecture combines a private blockchain-restricted to verified institutional nodes f or managing submissions and contract execution through smart con-tracts-with a public blockchain that allows real-time auditability by external stakeholders. Blockchain ensures cryptographic security and immutable audit trails, while IPFS provides decentralized, scalable, and cost-effective storage beyond blockchain’s intrinsic limitations. The proposed framework is designed to align with Ecuador’s Organic Law of the National Public Procurement System (LOSNCP), particularly Articles 6, 25, and 31, which establish transparency, equity, and efficiency as guiding principles. Technical evaluation through simulations compares Ethereum and Algorand in terms of transaction costs, performance, and energy efficiency, justifying the a doption of Ethereum for its broader maturity. While results confirm the f easibility of the system, limitations remain, as validation relies on simulations rather than pilot deployments, and scalability under real-world conditions requires further study.

According to the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources in 2023, electricity usage had grown from 2022. During that period, the internet became widely used because of the new normal. Responding to that, NDN also has the same issues; considerable power expenditure of $0.023 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{MB}$ is required for DRAM access. Previous research has shown power reduction. It’s still considered insignificant due to caching. This research proposes a comparison of LFU and LRU as cache replacements on the NDN forwarder YANFD. This research comprises four test scenarios. Based on the results, in overall LFU has more efficient result than LRU. LFU shows more than 3, 57% higher cache hit ratio performance. As for QoS, RTT has a lower value of more than $\\mathbf{2, 9 8 \\%}$ than LRU. Throughput also has higher result, with a range of 3,04% to 19% faster than LRU."

MLCAE defines a set of standard layers (Core, Communication, Deployment) and allows for the dynamic creation of non-standard layers (Security, Monitoring, DevOps pipelines, Integration, etc.), depending on project-specific requirements. The model supports role-based placement of AEs (Primary Layer Placement, Secondary Layer Presence, Interface Anchors, Deployment Bindings), indexing mechanisms for managing overlapping AEs across multiple systems and categorization to differentiate between architectural types. Furthermore, MLCAE introduces layer priorities for conflict resolution and architectural packages to group cross-layer AEs. A case study with ERP, CRM, DMS, PLM and SCM demonstrates the practical applicability of MLCAE in enterprise environments, showing improvements in coverage, conflict resolution and integration compared to traditional architectural modeling. The results indicate that MLCAE can serve as a strategic tool for enterprise architecture management and future research directions include AI-assisted classification of AEs and automated visualization dashboards."

The experimental setup employed a 5 kW HT-PEMFC stack operating in parallel with an electrochemical battery pack. Hydrogen was produced in a methanol reforming system directly integrated with the HT-PEMFC stack. The test stand was equipped with an additional external liquid cooling system containing 100% triethylene glycol (TEG). The electricity generator achieved a nominal electrical power of P ≃ 5 kW. Tests showed that the maximum amount of heat extracted from the H3-5000 generator by the TEG-based liquid cooling system was 9.4 MJ/h (corresponding to a thermal output of 2.6 kW). Additionally, heat is removed from the generator via exhaust gas streams from the anode compartment, ventilation air from the interior of the housing, and air from the cathode compartment of the HT-PEMFC fuel cell. The potential thermal output of these gases is approximately 3 kW. These results confirm the feasibility of recovering heat from the HT-PEMFC cell for use in heating technologies, such as providing hot water or heating homes."

    "abstract": "There is a variety of national pathways to net zero emissions by 2050. Some countries have rapidly expanded the share of renewable energy and phased down fossil fuels, while others like Japan have taken a more cautious approach. In this paper we examine two possible future trajectories of Japan’s energy transition, namely the Japanese government scenario that is already being implemented under the Seventh Strategic Energy Plan and the Renewable Energy Institute (REI) scenario. The former keeps a relatively high level of reliance on fossil fuels, supports the revival of nuclear power, as well as the application of new technologies such as hydrogen/ammonia co-firing and carbon capture and storage. The proponents of the latter argue for a larger expansion of variable renewable energy such as wind and solar combined with an emphasis on energy storage, electricity grid enhancement, and demand response. We evaluate these two scenarios by focusing on their impact on Japan’s climate goals, energy security, and power system costs. While we agree with many of the REI’s criticisms toward the government scenario, we argue that REI’s ambitious targets for solar and wind in 2040 may not be very realistic having in mind the challenges that Japan faces in developing its renewable energy infrastructure."

A remaining challenge is ensuring appropriate acoustic conditions for the air-supply ducts leading into the enclosure. The use of noise silencers is necessary; however, they introduce flow resistance in the inlet duct. Therefore, a system incorporating a palisade-type arrangement of elements for acoustic wave scattering was proposed, and a numerical analysis of airflow conditions in the inlet duct with the proposed solution was carried out. The analysis was performed with respect to evaluating flow resistance as a parameter directly affecting the energy demand of the fan that forces the airflow through the duct.

    "abstract": "This study examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in fostering creativity in education. Although the impact of AI on creativity has been widely studied in fields such as computer science and the arts, its influence on creative processes in education remains underexplored. A survey of 127 respondents examined perceptions of the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of using AI to enhance creativity during the learning process. The results show widespread recognition of creativity as an essential component of education, but also reveal a significant discrepancy between this recognized importance and the practical integration of methods to enhance creativity. A SWOT analysis reveals strengths, including the ability of AI to adapt learning experiences to individual learner needs and support new educational models. However, weaknesses and threats stem from insufficient training of educators, ethical concerns about the role of AI in decision-making, and the risk of reducing learners' critical thinking. The study highlights the need for education systems to evolve in parallel with emerging intelligent technologies, i.e. AI should act not simply as a tool, but as an active collaborator in the creative learning process. Ultimately, through thoughtful and ethical integration of AI, education can foster creativity in ways that complement critical thinking and prepare learners for a technology-rich future."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of two refrigeration systems designed for a commercial display cabinet using R134a and R290 refrigerants. Both commercial display cabinets are identical, the difference is only in the used refrigerant (and also on some of the components) so the study aims to evaluate their thermodynamic performance, energy efficiency, environmental impact, and regulatory compliance. The two refrigerated display cabinets are manufactured based on refrigeration load calculations and component sizing and selection. The refrigerants are assessed based on key performance indicators such as cooling capacity, coefficient of performance (COP), global warming potential (GWP), total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) and refrigerant charge requirements. R134a is a conventional HFC that has proven its qualities for the selected application, but has a high GWP. In contrast, R290, which is a natural refrigerant with ultra-low GWP, offers higher efficiency but with limited charge due to its flammability. The results of comparative analyses show that R290 provides better performance with a lower environmental impact, which supports its readiness for sustainable use in commercial refrigeration equipment. The article highlights the potential of R290 to replace high-GWP refrigerants but only in the light commercial applications due to its flammability."

    "abstract": "Large programming courses often use test-driven autograding systems (e.g., CodeRunner) for instant feedback, but these usually only show which tests failed without explaining why or how to fix the error. Novice students struggle with such minimal guidance and often resort to trial-and-error. Meanwhile, AI coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) can provide hints and code suggestions, but novices may over-trust these outputs and lack the skills to verify them. To solve these issues, we present TraceMate, an IDE plugin that pairs the autograder’s tests with a conversational AI chatbot. TraceMate augments test feedback with context-aware explanations and inline suggestions for code modifications, and immediately validates each AI suggestion on the test suite. This workflow gives actionable hints while ensuring any AI-proposed changes are correct. In a user study with novice programmers, participants using TraceMate solved problems more effectively and reported higher confidence than those using only the autograder. These results suggest that pairing automated tests with an interactive AI assistant can enhance learning in introductory programming courses."

    "abstract": "Achieving robust robot learning for humanoid locomotion is a fundamental challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where environmental stochasticity and randomness can hinder efficient exploration and learning stability. The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified in high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics and entangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In this work, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DoublyAware</i>, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes uncertainty into two disjoint, interpretable components, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, planning and policy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DoublyAware</i> employs conformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated risk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic dynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative priors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint (GRPC) optimizers, which impose a group-based adaptive trust region in the latent action space. This combination enables the robot agent to prioritize high-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted exploration under uncertainty. Evaluated on the HumanoidBench locomotion suite with the Unitree 26-DoF H1-2 humanoid, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DoublyAware</i> demonstrates improved sample efficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced motion feasibility compared to RL baselines.

    "abstract": "Integrated circuit (IC) marking detection faces critical “Triple C” challenges: compact marking scales, complex multidirectional layouts, and costly annotation requirements. Traditional models struggle with data scarcity in dynamic manufacturing environments where fine-grained labeled data are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This work presents MarkingVLM, a specialized vision-language model designed for IC marking detection with exceptional few-shot learning capabilities. MarkingVLM adapts cross-modal understanding from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) through unique innovations: 1) dual-granularity detection combining patch-level semantic alignment with pixel-level visual decoding; 2) layout mirror module enabling efficient multidirectional text flow recognition through feature-level augmentation; and 3) enhanced prompt engineering with learnable contexts for effective domain adaptation. Extensive experiments across two IC marking datasets with distinct characteristics substantiate superior performance: 94.2% precision and 96.5% recall on Dataset-1, and 89.6% precision with 92.6% recall on the more challenging Dataset-2. Most significantly, MarkingVLM achieves 92.7% precision with 32 training samples and maintains over 80% recall with merely 8 samples, demonstrating notable data efficiency improvement over conventional methods. Results establish a new paradigm for industrial text detection by bridging open-domain vision-language knowledge with specialized manufacturing requirements."

    "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems, where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E) transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems. The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter (CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native NextG."

Despite substantial research, studies on AI-enabled consumer information search remain fragmented, providing limited integration of insights across technological, behavioral, and managerial perspectives. To address this, we conduct a systematic literature review guided by the PRISMA protocol and grounded theory, identifying four thematic areas: Information Search and AI recommendation, AI conversation, AI anthropomorphism, and AI retrieval, which are structured into a search-theme mapping framework to organize themes across the consumer search stages. The findings under each theme are synthesized to reveal research gaps, derive future research propositions, and highlight managerial implications. This synthesis shows how engineering managers can apply AI recommendation strategies, message framing, anthropomorphic design, modality, cognitive load, and generative AI timing to optimize consumer search, decision making, and engagement. Overall, the study synthesizes fragmented knowledge, advances theoretical understanding, and provides a structured foundation for guiding future research and managerial practice in engineering management."

Graphene is employed owing to its high electron mobility and tunable conductivity at terahertz frequencies. The antenna occupies a compact footprint of 130 μm × 240 μm × 12.5 μm and exhibits resonances at 0.69 THz and 0.93 THz. High isolation values of 23 dB and 35 dB are achieved at the respective resonant frequencies. An equivalent circuit model is developed, which closely validates the simulated S-parameter results. The antenna demonstrates a realized gain above 4 dBi and total efficiency exceeding 80% across the operating bands. Furthermore, key diversity metrics, including envelope correlation coefficient, diversity gain, channel capacity loss, and total active reflection coefficient, are evaluated to confirm its suitability for MIMO applications. The proposed design, analyzed using CST Microwave Studio, offers a promising solution for emerging THz communication systems."

One of the most widely used approaches for simulating atmospheric variables is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which has proven effective in both climate research and numerical weather prediction. In this work, outputs from the WRF model are integrated with a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), an unsupervised neural network technique in the field of Machine Learning, to create a robust framework for classifying spatial patterns of evapotranspiration. Moreover, to optimize the processing of large volumes of simulated meteorological data, we propose the use of the Somoclu library, an efficient implementation of SOM that significantly accelerates training while preserving the topological structure of high-resolution data. Specifically, the proposed approach is applied to classify climatic patterns associated with ETo in Ecuador’s Amazon and Andean regions. The results reveal both stable and dynamic spatial groupings of ETo, providing strategic information that can significantly contribute to improved irrigation practices and water resource planning."

This paper suggests a hybrid architecture that combines deep features taken from MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0, two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have already been trained. Dataset consist of 4768 training images and 1191 testing images across six classes are two healthy classes and four sick classes which features were taken from a combined dataset of maize leaf and maize stalk images that was obtained from Kaggle and divided into training and testing subsets in an 80:20 ratio. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was used to assess the characteristics. According to experimental data, hybrid CNN had the greatest test accuracy of 98.57%, but MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 with only one feature had accuracies of 95.89% and 96.64%, respectively. KNN achieved the best balance between accuracy and computational cost, and the proposed feature fusion improved discriminative power. The pipeline shows strong potential for automated maize disease detection and may benefit from a larger dataset and end-to-end fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "Dynamic hand gesture authentication (DHGA) has emerged as a promising biometric technology, offering enhanced theoretical security over conventional unimodal systems by combining both physiological and behavioral characteristics. Existing DHGA research predominantly focuses on controlled lab conditions, therefore showing low generalizability to uncontrolled application conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Skeleton-assistant Standardization and Authentication Framework (SSAF) that incorporates a generic data preprocessing method before authentication. First, we introduce a Geometry- Environment Standardization (GE-Stan) method to standardize five primary geometric and environmental factors inducing data distribution discrepancy, significantly improving robustness across different sessions and scenarios. Notably, the GE-Stan method can be applied to most existing algorithms and brings substantial improvement. Second, we design an Appearance and Motion Network (AM-Net) to fully leverage standardized video and skeleton data. It decouples appearance and motion features using specialized representation and processing strategies. Therefore, our SSAF achieves a flexible balance between accuracy and efficiency, enabling up to 3.6× efficiency boost with only minor accuracy trade-offs. Finally, to support real-world evaluation, we also contribute a new challenging dataset, SCUT-RealDHGA, captured under uncontrolled practical conditions with diverse backgrounds and illuminations. Extensive experiments across three DHGA datasets demonstrate that SSAF outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUTBIP-Lab/SSAF."

In addition, the heating problem of the motor can also reduce the reliability of the system. To address the issue of difficulty in obtaining motor characteristics, this article proposes a torque estimation method based on piecewise Lagrange-Fourier joint interpolation, which accurately characterizes magnetic flux and torque characteristics with only a small amount of magnetic chain data. To solve the problem of discrete control in the traditional direct torque control strategy’s torque hysteresis control method, a pulse width modulation control method is introduced. Based on the characteristics of torque generation, an efficient duty cycle strategy is established, improving motor efficiency and ultimately achieving efficient and precise control of the instantaneous torque of SRM."

    "abstract": "Infrared tiny target detection is of great value in fields such as military reconnaissance and security early warning but faces challenges including low signal-to-noise ratio, performance-efficiency trade-offs, and detection-false alarm compromises in complex dynamic scenarios. To solve these questions, we propose a novel Spatio-Spectral-Temporal Progressive (SSTP) Algorithm, integrating spatial, spectral and temporal features for infrared tiny target detection in cluttered scenes. First, it adopts anisotropic gradient difference detection algorithm to construct a spatial candidate target set based on the anisotropic radiation characteristics of target neighborhoods. Then, we use the isolation penalty adaptive clustering algorithm to obtain boundaries via outlier-enhanced clustering, and design a multilateral context filling algorithm to generate suspected regions and fill internal boundary information. Additionally, we develop an adaptive nonlinear geometric filter for point screening using nonlinear structural features, apply a multi-scale wavelet energy filter to capture high-frequency features, and utilize a target-background local difference measurement algorithm to extract regional independence for screening. Based on the proposed single frame detection method, a multi-dimensional feature fusion-based dynamic target tracking algorithm is employed to extract moving targets. Experiments show that on multi-frame datasets DSAT and single-frame datasets SIRST, the proposed method significantly outperforms mainstream algorithms, achieving detection rates of 98.75% and 98.23% as well as false alarm rates of 2.56 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−6</sup> and 10.86 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−6</sup>, respectively. The algorithm not only performs well in multi frame detection, but also has good performance in single frame detection. It thus provides a solution with high robustness and real-time performance for infrared early warning systems in complex environments."

    "abstract": "The accumulation of metallic debris in marine environments exacerbates ecological risks. Among them, non-ferromagnetic metals such as aluminum and copper are difficult to detect due to their low magnetic susceptibility. To address these limitations, we propose a compact transient electromagnetic (TEM) detection system implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The system is designed for underwater applications and potential integration with mobile platforms. It features precise timing control and front-end hardware-level signal extraction for detecting weak transient responses from non-ferromagnetic targets. Meanwhile, finite element simulations of electromagnetic propagation in conductive seawater are used to model the temporal decay of underwater target signals and guide system design. Within the FPGA, a time-channel extraction (TCE) strategy is embedded directly into the FPGA logic to achieve real-time gating and frame-based signal compression, thereby suppressing hardware interference and reducing redundant data. Unlike conventional post-acquisition compression, this in-hardware implementation achieves real-time signal extraction with minimal latency, reducing data storage by 99.95%. In addition, an orthonormal basis function (OBF) algorithm is incorporated to support target response detection. Through this integration, the proposed approach addresses key limitations of traditional TEM systems, including limited real-time capability and excessive storage requirements. Experimental validation demonstrates that the system detects a 10 cm aluminum tube at a distance of 0.6 m, confirming its strong real-time performance and suitability for underwater applications. Overall, the proposed system provides an effective solution for underwater detection of low-susceptibility non-ferromagnetic metal targets."

Design of an axial active magnetic bearing (AMB) is implemented as part of a novel heat pump compressor design. The case study highlights the importance of integrating various design areas to streamline the overall design process. All results are produced exclusively through the design process and methodology outlined in Part I. The study presents geometries for two thrust bearing configurations in relation to the shaft diameter, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of the design through a sensitivity analysis. Analytical calculation results are compared with finite element simulations, not only to validate the accuracy of the design, but also to generate data that can refine the design details. The key outcome of this study is not the precise design itself, but the clear improvement in the design process efficiency, resulting in a methodology where the bearing design lead time is measured in days rather than weeks or months. Although, not all steps in the design process are entirely accurate and could be further improved, the design method allows easy modification, illustrating the interactions between parameters in this multidisciplinary process."

However, accurate segmentation can be hindered by factors like irregular cell shapes, unclear boundaries, and class imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Gated Attention Fusion Network (AGAFNet), which integrates three innovative attention-based blocks into a U-shaped architecture complemented by dedicated decoders for both segmentation and classification tasks. These blocks comprise the Channel-wise and Spatial Attention Integration Block (CSAIB) for enhanced feature representation and selective focus on informative regions; the Adaptive Gated Convolutional Block (AGCB) for robust feature selection throughout the network; and the Fusion Attention Refinement Block (FARB) for effective information fusion. AGAFNet leverages these elements to provide a robust solution for precise nuclei segmentation and classification in H&E stained histology images. We evaluate the performance of AGAFNet on three large-scale multi-tissue datasets: PanNuke, CoNSeP, and Lizard. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed AGAFNet achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them. Last but not least, a diffusion-based accelerator is adopted to predict the keyframes and pushing modes that should be prioritized during hybrid search; and further improve planning efficiency. The framework is complete under mild assumptions. Its efficiency and effectiveness under different numbers of robots and general -shaped objects are validated extensively in simulations and hardware experiments, as well as generalizations to heterogeneous robots, planar assembly and 6D pushing."

To address these issues, this paper proposes a data-driven adaptive control method for distributed PV clusters based on primal-dual transformation. The complex physical constraints for PV control are relaxed and decoupled to reduce the problem complexity. A hierarchical coordinated control framework is developed to facilitate data-driven optimization of PV control strategies under fluctuating conditions without requiring accurate ADN parameters. Furthermore, a dynamic coordination approach based on the Gompertz curve model is introduced to manage the active and reactive power of PVs in real time, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of converter reactive power capacity. The proposed method is validated on modified IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node test systems. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating voltage and power violations, confirming its practicality and adaptability in uncertain network conditions."

Shared grasps are defined as grasp poses feasible to both the initial and goal object configurations in a pick-and-place task. Traditional analytical methods for solving shared grasps evaluate grasp candidates separately, leading to substantial computational overhead as the candidate set grows. To overcome the limitation, we introduce an Energy-Based Model (EBM) that predicts shared grasps by combining the energies of feasible grasps at both object poses. The formulation enables early identification of promising candidates and significantly reduces the search space. Experiments show that our method improves grasp selection performance, offers higher data efficiency, and generalizes well to varying grasps and table heights, given that variations fall within the learned distributions."

    "abstract": "Early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), particularly at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, is essential for effective intervention and disease management. Traditional deep learning models often struggle to simultaneously capture both local and global brain connectivity patterns from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. To address these challenges, we propose the Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Multi-Neighbour Aggregation Graph Convolutional Network (Hi-STMNA-GCN), a novel deep learning framework designed for robust AD classification. The Hi-STMNA-GCN model operates at two levels: at the Region Level, it employs multi-neighbour aggregation graph convolutional networks to comprehensively capture spatial dependencies by aggregating information from neighbouring nodes across multiple scales, while Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) effectively model the temporal dynamics of brain activity. At the Population Level, a hypergraph-based module is introduced to learn complex inter-subject relationships, enhancing the global discriminative power of the model. Additionally, a Masked Relation Learning (MRL) mechanism is integrated to prune redundant connections, ensuring that the most informative brain region interactions are preserved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-STMNA-GCN significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 96% (AD vs. Cognitively Normal (CN)), 94.8% (AD vs. MCI), and 98% (MCI vs. CN). These results highlight the model’s potential for early, reliable AD detection and its applicability in advancing neuroimaging-based diagnostic tools."

Common vulnerabilities include insecure communication protocols, weak encryption, and inadequate authentication mechanisms. Mitigation strategies proposed in the literature involve regular software updates, secure encryption, and strong authentication practices. However, most studies lack actionable guidance for clinical implementation and fail to address emerging technological and regulatory developments.

These countries have witnessed financial institutions introducing mobile banking applications. These apps empower users to perform money transfers, bill payments, and account inquiries anytime, anywhere. However, this proliferation also raises significant security concerns. Poorly implemented security measures during app development can expose users and financial institutions to substantial financial risks through increased vulnerability to cyberattacks. Our study evaluated fifty-nine WAEMU mobile banking apps using static analysis techniques. We collected these mobile banking apps from the 160 banks and financial institutions of the eight WAEMU countries listed on the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) website. We identified security-related code issues that malicious actors could exploit. We investigated the issues found in the older versions to track their evolution across updates. Additionally, we identified some banks from regions such as Europe, the United States, and other developing countries and analyzed their mobile apps for a security comparison with WAEMU banking apps. Key findings include: (1) WAEMU apps exhibit security issues introduced during development, posing significant exploitation risks; (2) Despite frequent updates, underlying security issues often persist; (3) Compared to banking apps from developed countries, WAEMU apps exhibit fewer critical issues; and (4) Apps from banks that are branches of other non-WAEMU banks often inherit concerns from their parent apps while also introducing additional issues unique to their context. Our research underscores the need for robust security practices in WAEMU mobile banking app development to enhance user safety and trust in financial services."

Our study investigates (1)the relationship between game-player agency and student agency, (2)the relationships between both forms of agency and learning gain, (3)the relationships between both forms of agency and engagement, and (4)the indirect effects of engagement on the relationship between agency and learning gain. Log data from 2,261 students in an English learning game, LingoCity, was analyzed across three different age groups; earlier elementary grades (aged 7-9), later elementary grades (aged 10-12), and middle school grades (aged 13-15). Our results showed that (1)an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between game-player and student agency in all groups (p-values <0.05); (2)for middle school grades, learning gain had a positive relationship with student agency (p=0.030) and a negative relationship with game-player agency ($\\mathbf{p}{\\lt}0.001$), while no significant direct effects were observed for elementary grades; (3)both agencies had a positive relationship with engagement, except for student agency and total engagement frequency—how often students interacted with the learning game regardless of activity type—in earlier elementary grades; and (4)learning engagement frequency—how often students participated in learning-related activities—significantly mediated both agencies and learning gain in all groups.

In this context, this work explores the fine-tuning of the Wav2Vec 2.0 model, developed by Meta AI, for ASR in Kichwa-a low-resource language spoken in the Ecuadorian Andes. The training process utilized two datasets totaling approximately 8 hours of audio, segmented into clips ranging from 1.5 to 5 seconds, with manually aligned transcriptions created using ELAN software. Fine-tuning was performed using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function. After multiple experiments, a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed no statistically significant improvement when applying SpecAugment. The best-performing model, trained without data augmentation, achieved promising results on the test set: a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.262, a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.120, and a Match Error Rate (MER) of 0.401. These findings d emonstrate the viability of adapting pre-trained self-supervised models to low-resource settings and underscore the potential of ASR technologies to support greater linguistic inclusivity in artificial intelligence."

    "abstract": "The Peruvian flexible packaging industry is a strategic pillar for food, beverage, and hygiene sectors. It contributes 7.4% to the manufacturing Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, its competitiveness is limited by operational deficiencies linked to low Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). In the studied plant, OEE reached only 69.47%, compared to the 85% standard. This gap caused losses equivalent to 3.08% of annual revenue due to recurrent mechanical misalignments, accelerated component wear, overload failures, and setup times of up to 45 minutes. To address these issues, the research proposes an integrated model with two pillars. The first is Predictive Maintenance (PdM) supported by Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, where vibration, temperature, and pressure sensors with more than 95% accuracy enable early failure detection. The second is the Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) methodology combined with Centerline, which reduces process variability and ensures stable operation. Validation through As-Is and To-Be scenarios and indicators shows significant improvements. OEE increases by 15.53 percentage points. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) rises from 12 to 20 hours. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) decreases from 4.2 to 2.5 hours. Setup time is reduced from 45 to 20 minutes. The findings demonstrate that integrating IoT, PdM, SMED, and Centerline is a technically and economically feasible strategy that strengthens sustainability and competitiveness in the Peruvian flexible packaging industry."

    "abstract": "Cement production represents a core element of our building materials industry not only historically, but also currently and in the future. It not only supports our infrastructure, but also makes modern civilization as we know it possible. For this reason, the demand for cement will continue to double in the near future.A core element of cement production is the clinker process in a rotary kiln. This process is both energy-intensive and difficult to control. Due to harsh environmental conditions and high temperatures, there are few meaningful measurements within the process. In addition, there are complex influencing process factors such as input raw materials and variable fuels. The fuels in particular lead to increased environmental pollution through exhaust gases.Thus, the cement industry is currently facing major challenges in the production of clinker in rotary kilns. Some of these are monitoring kiln operation, accurate measurement of zone temperature, reducing emission and fuel consumption.A highly qualified development team and a cement manufacturer has addressed these challenges together and has developed and tested in real environment an artificial intelligence-based control algorithm for the rotary kiln in a pilot project. This control algorithm, based on Artificial neural networks (ANNs) indicates changes in the rotary kiln process at an early stage, based on the input parameters, and makes suggestions for action to optimize the control of the process. Thus, not only can the process run in an optimal range, but also fuels and emissions can be reduced. This solution is part of cement specific software and platform solution."

    "abstract": "As cement is the most widely consumed building product in the world, a huge volume is produced. Therefore, cement production is responsible for about 8% of man-made CO2-emissions [1]. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted four principal CO2 reduction levers. Key strategies to cut carbon emissions in cement production include improving energy efficiency, switching to lower-carbon fuels, promoting material efficiency (to reduce the clinker-to-cement ratio and total demand), and advancing process and technology innovations such as CCS [2]. Reducing the clinker proportion in cement is said to be the far most effective measure. The properties of SCM such as e.g. feed moisture, granulometry and reactivity will be discussed as an important pre-condition for the grinding process. The flexible layout and versatility of the performance of the vertical modular roller mill will be discussed."

    "abstract": "Real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model on a soccer robot is often hampered by the unique visual challenges of omni-directional cameras, such as significant image distortion and high sensitivity to dynamic outdoor lighting variations. To address these issues, this study systematically investigates the effect of seven different image preprocessing techniques on improving ball and goal detection performance without requiring computationally expensive model retraining. Using the standard YOLOv8 model and an annotated outdoor dataset, different preprocessing categoriesincluding color correction, contrast enhancement, and blurring filters-are comparatively evaluated. Their performance is measured against a baseline using the mean Average Precision (mAP50) metric. The results show that White Balance, a color correction technique, significantly improves performance and achieves the highest mAP50 score (0.895) compared to the baseline (0.849). This success is attributed to its ability to neutralize the dominant environmental colors, resulting in more consistent intrinsic object features. In contrast, blurring-based methods prove counterproductive because they remove edge features crucial for detection. This study concludes that color correction is the most effective preprocessing strategy, offering a practical and efficient solution to improve detection robustness in dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Access to healthy food plays a crucial role in ensuring national food security. One of the main challenges in healthy food production is maintaining the quality of fruits, which are susceptible to spoilage. A machine might be more effective than humans at automatically identifying rotten fruits in large quantities, as humans are prone to mistakes, especially when fatigued. Computers can help humans as they do not have the issue of exhaustion. The use of artificial intelligence to assist computers in detecting spoiled fruits is continuously advancing. Classifying fruits using colour-based RGB images versus grayscale images is a highly competitive task. This research shows that grayscale image classification results are statistically comparable to the colour for fruit classification cases, which uses a lower computational cost in a resourcehungry convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The grayscale mode for the classification task improves accuracy compared to red-green-blue (RGB) mode or colour mode by roughly 5%, 13%, and 4% for Apple, Orange and Mango, respectively."

Solana (SOL), one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, experiences sharp fluctuations that limit the effectiveness of traditional linear models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH). To address this, the present study evaluates twelve Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) architecture variants, including vanilla LSTM, stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, and hybrid models with attention and dropout mechanisms, for forecasting daily closing prices of the SOL/USD pair. Five years of OHLCV data from Coinbase were used, with an $80 / 10 / 10$ split for training, validation, and testing. Performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$. Results show that the LSTM-Base model (60-day window, 1-day horizon) achieved the best accuracy (MAE $=5.38$, RMSE $=6.73$, MAPE $=3.27 \\%, \\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}=\\mathbf{0. 8 2}$), while LSTM-LB120-H7 (120-day window, 7-day horizon) performed poorly (MAE $=14.09$, RMSE $=17.44, \\mathbf{R}^{2}=-0.34$). These findings highlight that simpler LSTM configurations are more effective for volatile crypto assets, offering both academic insight and practical benchmarks for traders, analysts, and policymakers."

While there is growing interest in the metaverse, systematic evaluations of student perceptions remain limited and crucial. This study evaluates student perceptions of an educational metaversebased campus tour, using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and thematic feedback analysis. Students rated their likelihood to recommend the platform on a $0-10$ scale. The NPS was 41.2 (Excellent), showing general satisfaction and recommendation willingness. Subgroup analysis revealed minor age differences but more substantial variation by gender and prior experience: female respondents (57.1) and first-time users (54.6) were highly positive, while male respondents (37.0) and frequent users (0.0) were more critical. Thematic insights explained that younger students emphasized usability and engagement, older students utility and performance, males technical concerns, females satisfaction, and experienced users highlighted expectation gaps and performance critiques. The findings suggest the educational metaverse effectively engages novices but requires refinements to satisfy advanced users. This approach demonstrates how NPS-based group analysis, enriched with qualitative insights, can serve as a practical and scalable framework for evaluating user experience in educational metaverse platforms."

    "abstract": "Active noise control (ANC) improves audio quality in applications such as VoIP, headsets, earbuds, and speakerphones. However, impulsive noise consisting on unpredictable, high-amplitude spikes from sources like traffic or industrial equipment poses significant challenges to conventional ANC algorithms. To ensure reliable performance under such conditions, developing robust active impulsive noise control (AINC) systems is needed for mitigating these real-world acoustic disturbances and preserving sound clarity. In this paper new algorithms for active impulsive noise control using the proportionate affine projection tanh versions, dichotomous coordinate descent iterations (DCD), and the approximated tanh rational function are proposed. The impact of the tanh parameter, step size and projection order on convergence properties is analyzed or both monochannel and multichannel cases, revealing similar performance to that of previously designed tanh-based algorithms. An important contribution of this work is the investigation of the logarithmic update rule within the proportionate-type algorithms for active impulsive noise control. It is shown that the incorporation of the multiplier-free and division-free dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) method reduces the computational complexity associated with tanh-based affine projection algorithms for AINC. Furthermore, a rational-function approximation of the tanh function is used, facilitating efficient implementation on digital signal processors and field-programmable gate arrays."

However, these models often fall short due to being computationally expensive or monolithic \"black box\" systems. This paper introduces d-CoSE, a decoupled architecture that separates the biophysical auditory feature enhancement and waveform synthesis tasks, which are implicitly coupled within its monolithic predecessor. To demonstrate the advantages of this architectural change, the proposed system is systematically compared against the original CoSE framework. The decoupled design enables advanced training strategies, such as a hybrid loss function and a final fine-tuning stage, which are not possible in a coupled model, allowing the d-CoSE system to surpass the baseline in perceptual quality (PESQ 2.42 vs 2.33). The results validate the decoupled approach, showing the architectural separation provides inherent benefits of modularity, transparency and potential for superior performance."

    "abstract": "The popularity of cloud storage makes it easy to share others’ data, such as accessing and editing electronic medical records. To control the editing, sanitizable signatures were developed to allow designated editors to modify restricted parts of the data with sanitizing keys. In particular, attributebased sanitizable signature (ABSS) has been explored for finegrained editing control, i.e., editors are determined by the owner through a policy. However, existing ABSS schemes can neither protect the anonymity of the owner due to signature verification under the owner’s public key, nor protect the data confidentiality due to the plaintext storage in the cloud server. Moreover, they do not consider the sanitizing key exposure issue. To this end, we propose FSEdit, a privacy-preserving and security-enhanced controllable editing framework for cloud storage. Specifically, we introduce an attribute-based sanitizable and puncturable signed encryption (AB-SPSE) primitive for FSEdit, where encrypted data can be anonymously verified via the owner’s attributes, and its admissible blocks can be modified by policy-authorized editors. Meanwhile, the editors’ sanitizing keys can be further punctured to guarantee forward secrecy. We design two novel building blocks, namely attribute-based equivalence-class signature, and attribute-based puncturable combined encryption and signature, and then construct FSEdit by leveraging them to instantiate AB-SPSE in asymmetric pairings. Finally, we show the security and efficiency of FSEdit through extensive security analysis and experimental results over existing ABSS schemes."

Our framework does not explicitly predict human motions but directly models the interaction effects on robot speed, simplifying implementation and enhancing generalizability to different safety logics. At runtime, the learned model optimizes task selection to minimize cycle time while adhering to safety requirements. Experiments on a pick-and-packaging scenario demonstrated significant reductions in cycle times."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT), particularly its industrial subset Industrial IoT, presents a critical attack surface due to its interconnected nature. As emerging threats exploit IoT edge networks, there is a growing demand for anomaly detection systems capable of addressing zero-day attacks while providing explainable predictions. Existing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods often lack explainability, sensitivity, absence of Large Language Model (LLM) agent for adaptive detection and struggle with unseen zero-day threats. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Anomaly-Agent, a novel LLM-powered explainable anomaly detection framework for IoT/IIoT edge environments. Anomaly-Agent leverages a reasoning-followed-by-action pipeline, integrating domain tools, external knowledge retrieval, and memory-augmented decisions to detect and explain anomalies. Unlike static ML/DL models, Anomaly-Agent adapts to evolving zero-day threats and supports sensitivity customization. We evaluated Anomaly-Agent on the Edge-IIoTset (IIoT-specific) and CIC-IoT2023 (general IoT) datasets, it achieved accuracies of 0.96 and 0.89, respectively, with a false alarm rate (FAR) below 0.04. It also attains a recall of 0.65 for zero-day attacks, surpassing traditional ML models and LLM baselines including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and GPT-4o-mini. Anomaly-Agent outperformed GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 due to their reliance on generic prompting, which limits performance to 64%–70% multi-class F1-score on CIC-IoT2023. Their high FAR of 10%-13% stems from misclassifying benign edge traffic as malicious. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini, where token constraints reduce accuracy to 58% for multi-class tasks. The agent’s performance benefits from integration with SHAP, enhancing transparency and trust. While demonstrating strong performance, Anomaly-Agent faces inherent challenges in latency in complex scenarios and adversarial robustness that guide future improvements. These results demonstrate Anomaly-Agent’s robustness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward resilient, LLM-driven IoT/IIoT security solutions."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to single-view face relighting in the wild, addressing challenges such as global illumination and cast shadows. A common scheme in recent methods involves intrinsically decomposing an input image into 3D shape, albedo, and lighting, then recomposing it with the target lighting. However, estimating these components is errorprone and requires many training examples with ground-truth lighting to generalize well. Our work bypasses the need for accurate intrinsic estimation and can be trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, relit pairs, multi-view images, or lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from off-the-shelf estimators. We propose a novel conditioning technique that simplifies modeling the complex interaction between light and geometry. It uses a rendered shading reference along with a shadow map, inferred using a simple and effective technique, to spatially modulate the DDIM. Moreover, we propose a single-shot relighting framework that requires just one network pass, given pre-processed data, and even outperforms the teacher model across all metrics. Our method realistically relights in-the-wild images with temporally consistent cast shadows under varying lighting conditions. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark Multi-PIE and rank highest in user studies."

By collaborating with the neighbor – country Greece, it is achievable to transfer wind energy produced by aiming to a maximal supply and efficient storage for both countries in the Balkan region. Although the energy mix is different from Greece and Bulgaria both countries cover more than half of their electricity demands with low-carbon energy sources. Simultaneously it imports a major part of the imported energy, one from another."

    "abstract": "Satellite image classification through conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) presents several drawbacks, especially the requirement for large amounts of labeled data and extensive computational power. To address these drawbacks, the present work investigated the use of Transfer Learning, which uses previously trained models to enhance efficiency and performance. We aimed to compare two methods: CNN training from scratch and the use of Transfer Learning through pretrained models such as ResNet50 and VGG16. Each model was trained for ten epochs and the procedure was repeated five times to account for consistency and minimize the impact of randomness. The evaluation considered global accuracy, averaged precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and deployability metrics. The results demonstrated the clear advantage of Transfer Learning. CNN achieved only $68.87 \\%$ accuracy, while VGG16 and ResNet50 reached $95.54 \\%$ and $96.89 \\%$, respectively. Classwise analysis confirmed that pretrained models reduced misclassifications in spectrally similar categories, enhancing robustness. In general, Transfer Learning emerged as the superior practical approach, achieving an excellent balance between accuracy, training time, and computational cost, and thus suitable for highperformance classification where resources are limited."

The evaluation was conducted through feedback from primary and secondary school teachers, who analyzed key aspects such as usability, educational content, interactivity, engagement, and user experience; each student group proposed a project that included an interactive game, question management, and teacher-led sessions, resulting in a web application that interfaced with an electronic device. Subsequently, the teachers evaluated the user interface of these projects, testing both the web application and the device’s functionality. The results indicate that, on average, 87.77% of the interactive applications were positively received across all evaluated aspects.

Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause cognitive overload and obscure a paper’s hierarchical structure, making it difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document’s navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic reading practices, we introduce Treereader, a novel language model-augmented paper reader. Treereader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to evaluate Treereader’s impact on reading efficiency and comprehension. Treereader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with interactive exploration."

    "abstract": "The exclusive dependence on the average run length (ARL) as a measure of performance for control schemes has faced considerable criticism in literature. The skewness and form of the run length distribution vary depending on the extent of the mean shift in a given process, rendering interpretations based only on the ARL possibly erroneous. Consequently, for estimated process parameters (Case-U), the previous study considered the median run length (MRL) indicator for the Shewhart median scheme. However, the MRL framework requires the assumption that the exact shift size is known in advance. In numerous practical applications, the exact magnitude of the shift is frequently indeterminate. To address this limitation, we investigated the construction of the Case-U Shewhart median scheme utilizing the expected MRL (EMRL) approach, which only requires the shift size to fall within a specified interval. We provide an example of the Case-U Shewhart median scheme applied to smart manufacturing, utilizing a dataset pertaining to the manufacturing of forged piston rings."

An approach an approach for constructing a bipartite network in which the nodes represent customers and campaigns, while the edges reflect customer participation in a given campaign. Building on this structure, two additional types of relationships are defined and examined: between customers (based on joint participation in campaigns) and between campaigns (based on shared customers). Network analysis metrics are computed, and the results are discussed in detail. Furthermore, leveraging the identified network structures, the study proposes a recommendation model for marketing campaigns. The model employs collaborative filtering to deliver personalized suggestions, drawing on similarities among customers and their prior interactions with campaigns. The findings of the analysis may be employed to optimize marketing strategies, personalize offers, and enhance campaign effectiveness through more accurate targeting. The proposed approach provides a methodological framework for understanding customer behavior through a network perspective and for developing effective recommender systems, which is of critical importance in contemporary digital marketing."

The system was developed using the Prototype model of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). A quantitative approach with simple linear regression was employed to analyze data collected from a questionnaire distributed to 35 students, measuring the system’s impact on learning quality. The designed system successfully transforms PDF documents into interactive, queryable mind maps. Regression analysis showed that the RAG-based system significantly impacts the quality of learning, explaining $74.6 \\%$ of the variance $\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}} \\boldsymbol{=} \\mathbf{0. 7 4 6}\\right)$. User evaluations and black-box testing confirmed the system’s functionality and effectiveness in enhancing conceptual understanding and providing a valuable, interactive educational tool.

This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an integrated component of UCD methodologies, specifically within the Design Sprint framework. Our goal is to analyze how LLMs can assist designers throughout different phases of the Design Sprint, improving efficiency and aiding in developing user-centered solutions. To achieve this goal, we conducted a study with Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Design students during a course on innovative software product engineering. The study was structured into three phases: (i) theoretical instruction, (ii) practical application of the design sprint methodology with LLM integration, and (iii) presentation and discussion of the developed products. We conducted focus groups to gather insights on the participants’ experiences using an LLM as a support tool for Design Sprint activities. Our results provide insights into how LLM can be leveraged to assist in rapid product design while preserving UCD principles."

In MASs, multiple autonomous agents with predetermined roles collaborate by dividing responsibilities. However, MAS developers often struggle to understand and diagnose agents’ behavior from thousands of inter-agent messages across multiple complex conversations. To identify key requirements and challenges related to evaluating, debugging, and managing MASs, we conducted a formative study with six MAS developers. We then introduce ConvoMap, a prototype that addresses a key challenge of MAS development-understanding agents’ behaviors across multiple conversations. ConvoMap integrates automated qualitative coding to enable multi-level inspection of agents’ behavior. ConvoMap can then visualize hundreds of MAS conversations by representing messages as points on a 2D map that encode their semantic meanings and interactions between agents. To better support navigation and deeper analysis, ConvoMap provides topic overviews and highlights relevant text segments. A comparison study showed that ConvoMap helped to understand agents’ behavior more accurately than the baseline."

    "abstract": "Population growth and the expansion of residential areas into remote regions have led to an increase in the occupation of isolated zones, many of which lack access to electric power networks. These communities, often living in poverty, face significant limitations in economic development due to the absence of reliable electricity. In such contexts, extending grid infrastructure is economically unfeasible and technically complex. As an alternative, distributed generation systems (DG) especially those based on renewable sources offer viable, sustainable, and adaptable solutions for areas with geographic constraints. This research proposes the optimal design of a hybrid generation system based on DG, composed of photovoltaic panels (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Unlike conventional methodologies, this study formulates an optimization problem that minimizes investment costs while incorporating technical and operational constraints, as well as estimated future demand. The formulation also models BESS using the Big-M method to ensure solvability via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The results are compared with traditional techniques, showing improved design efficiency, including a reduction in the number of panels and batteries required. The system is validated under different operational scenarios, demonstrating its capability to meet energy demand in off-grid households."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a notable surge in the adoption of cloud storage services. This has led to the widespread use of platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, which offer a viable option for enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses, home offices, and individuals to employ for purposes such as data repositories, data backup and restoration, as well as disaster recovery. However modern public cloud environments are highly dynamic which presents new security challenges particularly in user authorisation. Traditional user authorisation models struggle to adapt to shifting contextual conditions where users routinely access data anywhere at any time using any device. This inflexibility creates gaps that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorised access to sensitive data. Addressing this challenge requires innovative and adaptive solutions. In this light, we propose a conceptual user authorisation model for public cloud storage services to address the concerns of stakeholders and comprehend the state of modern public cloud storage security. By using literature review as the methodological foundation, the study identifies limitations within existing user authorisation models and establishes the essential components necessary for a dynamic, context-aware approach to user authorisation. The proposed conceptual model features a Contextual Data Collector (CDC), Contextual Analyser (CA), Dynamic Policy/Rules Generator (DP/RG), Authorisation Decision Point (ADP) and a Machine Learning Module (MLM). These components together create a conceptual model aimed to mitigate the risk of unauthorised data access and enhance the security and reliability of public cloud storage services"

We test quasi-specular scattering models in combination with a volume scattering formulation to model the backscatter coefficient as a function of incidence angle over specific areas identified from topographic and radar imaging data. From data inversion we found that the exponential model provides the best fit to the observed data. We present our results in terms of effective permittivity, surface roughness and volume scattering albedo across different backscattering uniform regions at Titan’s northern hemisphere, where both radar-bright and -dark terrains have been observed from radar images acquired during the mission. Our results indicate that these bright regions belong to a large low-lying plain made of material with a relatively high dielectric constant, high-volume scattering albedo, and moderate wavelength-scale roughness inferred from the model inversion. In contrast, dark regions are consistent with solid hydrocarbons accumulations, reaching thicknesses of up to hundreds of meters above this plain, and they exhibit a lower dielectric constant, lower volume albedo, and slightly higher wavelength-scale surface roughness together with additional higher meter- to tens-of-meter-scale roughness inferred from altimetry. Finally, we propose some of the most probable scenarios based on a list of candidate materials that may be present at the surface of Titan. Although our analysis focuses on a specific, albeit extensive, region near the North Pole, our findings may offer broader insights into the global distribution of complex organics on Titan surface, which are likely superimposed on top of a mixture of ice and organic material."

    "abstract": "Vibrotactile actuators are used in many different haptic devices, e.g. game controllers and smartphones. These vibrotactile actuators are typically made of rigid materials. In this paper, we use soft pneumatic actuators known as Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) to characterize the perceived intensity of vibrotactile stimuli when presented at the tip of the index finger. This study investigates how three parameters—stimulus pressure (4 to 30 kPa), inflation-deflation frequency (20 to 100 Hz), and actuator stiffness (determined by top layer thicknesses of 0.9 mm and 1.2 mm)—influence the perceptual intensity of the stimuli. Psychophysical experiments involving 16 participants were conducted using the AEPsych toolbox. These reveal that all the three parameters - pressure, frequency, and actuator stiffness significantly affect perceptual intensity. The findings indicate that both pressure and frequency exhibit a positive main effect and a positive interaction effect on perceived vibrotactile intensity. Additionally, the results show that, for a given frequency, pressure variations produce more perceptually distinct stimuli than frequency variations for a given pressure. Finally, presenting vibrotactile stimuli on a less stiff PUC actuator was perceived as being less intense than when the same stimulus was presented on a stiffer PUC actuator. Overall, this study provides key insights into the combined influence of pressure, frequency and actuator stiffness on the perceived vibrotactile intensity."

    "abstract": "Heat pipes (HPs) are increasingly applied in electrical machines to improve their cooling effectiveness. Due to spatial constraints within motors, cylindrical HPs are commonly flattened into flat pipes to accommodate confined spaces such as interlayer gaps in windings. This alteration in cross-sectional geometry may reduce HP thermal conductivity and thereby impair motor cooling performance. However, the intrinsic degradation mechanism and flattening effect remain unclear, which could potentially diminish HP cooling benefits in motors. Therefore, this study aims to address the above knowledge gap from both theoretical and experimental sides. Initially, the flattening effect on HP thermal conductivity is quantitatively investigated via analytical modeling and experimental measurements. Further, the impact of flattened HPs on motor additional losses and thermal performance is comprehensively evaluated and verified. Finally, practical guidelines for the application of flattened HPs in electrical machines are proposed considering requirements for high efficiency and high power density."

However, most systems rely on embedded chips and batteries, increasing complexity, weight, and cost that limit practicality. We present a battery-free chipless smart clothing that integrates thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-encapsulated passive LC relay networks to establish magnetic coupling between an external sensor reader and underlying arteries. Arterial pulsations induce resonant frequency shifts in the coupled system, enabling real-time pulse signal detection. Each sensing coil of passive LC relay networks is positioned at carotid, heart, radial, and femoral arteries, and four pickup coils are routed to a centralized hub on the upper left arm. A lightweight wireless reader with four channels simultaneously acquires multi-site physiological signals. Importantly, passive LC relay networks serve as magnetic field repeaters, enhancing magnetic coupling across extended distances. By matching resonant frequencies of passive LC relay networks and sensor reader at 7.3 MHz, the system achieved a power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 46.56 %, clearly outperforming the capacitor-free configuration, which yielded only 6 %. Notably, a minimum PTE threshold of 0.24 % was established for distinguishable pulse detection. The system showed robustness after water-spray exposure and supported signal acquisition through outer garments up to 21.22 mm thick between sensor reader and centralized hub, confirming resilience to sweat and compatibility with layered clothing. Overall, our battery-free chipless BSN offers lightweight, low-cost, and disposable smart clothing solutions for simultaneous multi-site hemodynamic monitoring, potentially calculating pulse wave velocity for peripheral vascular stiffness assessment."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) computation workloads are very challenging for resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Offloading of the AI workloads to edge nodes introduces network transport latencies that may make the offloading infeasible for low-latency applications. For applications that allow for anticipatory (speculative) computation with partial application datasets, e.g., scalable encoded images, we introduce and evaluate the concept of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">No further delay</i>. We define <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">No further delay</i> as the optimal tradeoff time instant between waiting for more application data (which increases the latency) and starting the speculative computation (whose success probability increases with more data). We evaluate the expected negative latency achieved by anticipatory computing with partial application-layer datasets compared to computation on the device (with full datasets) with a novel adaptation of the speedup factor (ratio) from Amdahl’s Law. Previously, speculative execution has been limited to the instruction-level in microprocessor program execution; in contrast, we are the first to propose and examine speculative execution for application-layer datasets. For a computer vision inference workload with progressively coded JPEG images, we find that our <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">No further delay</i> approach with edge node offloading achieves three-fold speedups (despite the network latency to the edge node).

    "abstract": "Cooperative surveillance systems used for Air Traffic Management (ATM) rely entirely on air-ground transactions in the 1030/1090 MHz frequency bands to achieve their surveillance objectives. However, these bands are currently experiencing an excessive volume of transactions, causing channel access difficulties and often exceeding the reply capabilities of aircraft transponders. This situation can potentially affect air traffic capacity and pose safety risks. Various mitigation strategies have been studied in recent years, but almost none of these strategies have adequately addressed the issue of minimizing transactions associated with Downlinked Aircraft Parameters (DAP) extracted from aircraft transponder registers. This work presents and evaluates a methodology designed to reduce DAP extractions by utilizing information already available via Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) messages, with the aim of reducing unnecessary transactions in the frequency channels while maintaining a similar level of information available at the end of the surveillance chain."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a compact and standalone 2.4 GHz/10 W microwave heating (MWH) device, along with the details of its interconnections and specifications. The device is useful for non-invasive superficial heating for diagnostic purposes (e.g., measuring blood perfusion), mild superficial hyperthermia, or small animal studies, with a target temperature of 40–45 °C. The device is accompanied by a front-end unit that houses an antenna and a temperature-regulation circuitry to minimize the temperature gradient between the body surface and the antenna for accurate MWH planning. This paper also introduces a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NL-ARX) modelling approach to accurately predict the MWH closed-loop response. The model was obtained by fitting open-loop measurements at five different power levels performed on a phantom. The phantom baseline temperature was around the body temperature. The NL-ARX models’ goodness of fit ranged from 90.7 to 96.5 % for a temperature rise of up to ∼18 °C from the baseline. The obtained model was then used as part of a closed-loop simulation with proportional-integral-differential (PID) feedback control. Appropriate choices of the PID gains were identified by an iterative approach, where the NL-ARX model was used as a surrogate to predict the closed-loop response. A desired system response had minimum overshoot and steady-state error. The simulation results were compared to closed-loop phantom measurements. A very good agreement between the measurements and simulations is observed for the initial rise time (within 12 s) and the steady-state (within ∼0.05 °C), indicating that the NL-ARX can accurately predict nonlinear MWH behavior."

Considerations are given to the constraints associated with voltage, current, radiality, and loading of branches. The topological analysis for reconfiguration focuses on creating meshes to determine the opening or closing of branches sectionalizing switches, ensuring the radiality of the system, and improving the search process for the optimal topological configuration. This analysis focuses on handling system incidence matrices to determine possible configurations of the state of sectionalizing switches. For each test system, various performance metrics are analyzed, such as algorithm convergence, execution time, quality of the solution found, and ability to meet established technical and operational constraints."

    "abstract": "When modifying an existing codebase to handle new functionality, programmers will often debug the program until the insertion point for the new code. This method, termed Debugging into Existence, helps programmers familiarize themselves with the surrounding code and runtime state. Despite its realworld usage, it is limited by the inability to test potential code past the first time the location is called, since added functionality would change the future state making it irrelevant. Prior work has pioneered Live Execution over partial programs, with extensions using the provided values for synthesis by Programming by Example. In this work, we present DeSynt, a debugger extension that integrates live execution and program synthesis to extend the Debugging into Existence interaction model. DeSynt grants programmers meaningful runtime information across many executions, by allowing them to manipulate program state according to the desired functionality. Based on the state provided by the programmer, DeSynt then synthesizes programs that capture this functionality. We evaluated DeSynt in a between-subjects study on 10 users, and found that in tasks that do not involve complex fault localization, deSynt reduces time to completion and concentrates programmer effort into fewer code locations. In addition, we found that users that used DeSynt spent more of their task time debugging, indicating DeSynt supports Debugging into Existence for those that already use it."

A robust image processing pipeline was designed, incorporating pre-processing steps to reduce noise and leveraging the Tesseract OCR engine for character recognition. The system achieved a recognition accuracy of $98.96 \\%$ even with lowresolution images and demonstrated efficient page manipulation. Performance evaluation highlighted differences in processing speed between a personal computer and the Raspberry Pi3, with the latter exhibiting reduced speed due to hardware limitations even while using low computational resources algorithms. These findings underscore the potential of humanoid robots in real-time applications, particularly in education and interactive learning environments, as well as highlighting some limitations."

In local methods such as greyest, success critically depends on providing suitable initial points; without them, convergence may lead to poor fits. In this study, we develop a nonlinear dynamic model based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), formulated as a system of six first-order differential equations with 22 parameters, to represent cognitive-behavioral dynamics associated with physical activity. To address the estimation challenge, we propose a hybrid framework in which Differential Evolution (DE) acts as a global search strategy to explore parameter ranges and identify plausible initial configurations, f ollowed by l ocal r efinement th rough MATLAB grey-box modeling. DE successfully identified a stable parameter set that achieved a fit of 86.11% u sing n ormalized longitudinal step-count data collected over 31 days. Subsequent refinement with the greyest function reduced the fit to 41%, reflecting the structural and stability constraints imposed by the grey-box approach. This procedure demonstrates that the combination of global heuristic exploration and structured local refinement offers a reproducible framework for obtaining interpretable dynamic models of human behavior, with potential applications in digital health systems that personalize interventions in real time."

A common problem that arises is that when a robot walks over obstacles such as stairs, it can fall if it is not balanced. The novelty of this research is the use of inverse kinematic and trajectory planning methods to control the balance of hexapod robots in stair navigation.

This study employs audio augmentation techniques including pitch shifting, time shifting, and noise addition to address the issue of data imbalance between Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Healthy Control (HC) labels identified in previous research. To mitigate this imbalance, oversampling is applied to the MDD class, which contains fewer samples than the HC class. The augmented data are then used to train two variations of the DeiT model, namely deit_base_patch16_224 and deit_small_patch16_224. Both models achieved an accuracy of approximately 70 percent across the training, validation, and testing phases. Although the deit_small_patch16_224 exhibited slightly lower accuracy compared to the deit_base_patch16_224 model, this performance was attained with only half the training time required by the deit_base_patch16_224. Furthermore, the proposed framework, which incorporates audio augmentation techniques, outperforms prior related studies by achieving a 14.82 percent performance improvement."

Real-world thermal energy and emission factor data are incorporated to capture operational uncertainty and assess the model’s robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the CAO framework achieves rapid and stable convergence, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. Validation through deterministic benchmarking confirms computational accuracy and consistency. The findings indicate that the proposed approach provides an adaptive, data-driven mechanism for designing fair and efficient carbon taxation policies. Consequently, this framework offers valuable implications for sustainable industrial management, enabling policymakers and practitioners to harmonize environmental protection objectives with economic performance in energy-intensive production systems."

This paper presents a critical state-of-the-art review focused on hybrid deep learning models-primarily combinations of convolutional and recurrent neural networks-applied to the prediction of seizures using multichannel EEG data, with a special focus on the challenges of absence epilepsy. This review analyzes trends in CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, and attention-based models. A key finding is that while promising, the field is hampered by significant challenges. This review critically highlights a major methodological pitfall: the over-reliance on patient-specific validation schemes, which inflates performance metrics and hinders the development of generalizable models for seizure prediction. Furthermore, the scarcity of well-labeled preictal datasets and the insufficient research focus on absence seizures are identified as primary barriers. The findings underscore the need for interpretable, robust, and clinically validated models for preictal state identification. Emerging approaches such as federated learning and explainable frameworks are discussed as key pathways to advance toward clinically deployable prediction systems."

Sentiment classification was performed using Bernoulli and Complement Naïve Bayes with TF-IDF features. The results show that Complement Naïve Bayes consistently outperforms Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, achieving up to 78% accuracy and 75% F1-score, which are particularly important for imbalanced datasets. These findings confirm the effectiveness of Naïve Bayes as a baseline model for short and noisy social media text and highlight the dominance of neutral sentiment in public discourse on carbon trading.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have great potential in urban traffic monitoring. However, their limited flight duration presents critical challenges in sustainable recharging strategies and efficient route planning in long-term monitoring tasks. Additionally, existing approaches for long-term monitoring often neglect the dynamic and evolving nature of urban traffic networks. In this study, we introduce a novel dynamic UAV routing framework for long-term, network-wide urban traffic monitoring, leveraging existing ground vehicles (GVs), such as public transit buses, as mobile charging stations without disrupting their operations. To address the complexity of long-term monitoring scenarios involving multiple flights, we decompose the problem into manageable single-flight tasks, in which each flight is modeled as a Team Arc Orienteering Problem with Decreasing Profits (TAOP-DP) with the objective to collectively maximize the spatiotemporal network coverage. Between flights, we adaptively update the edge weights to incorporate real-time traffic changes and revisit intervals. We validate our framework through extensive microscopic simulations in a modified Sioux Falls network under various scenarios, including static and changing demand levels and varying historical information availability. Comparative results demonstrate that our model outperforms three baseline approaches, especially when historical information is incomplete or absent. The scalability and generalizability of the framework are further validated through a portion of the Manhattan network with real world probe vehicle data. Moreover, we show that the proposed monitoring framework can capture network-wide traffic trends and construct accurate Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs), which highlights its potential in network-wide traffic control and management applications."

Different from previous works, we require neither the calibration among the multi-view cameras nor the actually captured BEV video. This makes the studied problem closer to real-world applications, however, more challenging. For this purpose, in this work, we propose a novel BEVTrack scheme. Specifically, given multi-view videos, we first use a virtual BEV transform module to obtain the BEV for each view. Then, we propose a unified BEV alignment module to fuse the respectively generated BEVs, in which we specifically design the self-supervised losses by considering both the spatial consistency and the temporal continuity. During the inference, we design the camera-subject collaborative registration and tracking strategy to make use of the mutual dependence between the multi-view cameras and the multiple targets, to achieve the desired BEV tracking. We also build a new benchmark for training and evaluation, the experimental results on which have verified the rationality of the problem and the effectiveness of our method."

    "abstract": "Ocean exploration using acoustical 3-D imaging is gaining popularity as it provides information about the 3-D geometry of the targets even under mild turbid conditions. A major challenge in underwater 3-D imaging is the high cost of the planar arrays and the computational complexity of the image reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we introduce the use of a uniform rectangle array placed at the edges of a uniform planar array for underwater 3-D imaging. During reconstruction, an orthogonal combination of two linear arrays which forms an L-shape is used to perform two independent and parallel 2-D delay and sum beamforming and the 3-D image is reconstructed using the product of the resulting beams. Each quadrant in the imaging slice is reconstructed in parallel using different L-shaped arrays. This quadrant-based time domain receive beamforming focuses on achieving relatively low computational complexity for real-time 3-D imaging in underwater environments. The proposed method with 47 hydrophones has reduced the main lobe width by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{2}^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> with 6 dB increase in the peak side lobe level when compared to the conventional delay and sum beamforming using a uniform planar array of 576 elements. Although there is an increase in the side lobe level, the asymmetric beam pattern of the proposed L array and the quadrant-based beamforming restrict the side lobes within a quadrant. The proposed method achieves a reduction in computation time by a factor of 97 for 3-D imaging compared to the conventional method, while maintaining acceptable image quality. For qualitative analysis, the 3-D images of different underwater targets have been reconstructed and compared in simulation and experiment."

This technique involves a combination of vapor-phase transport and oxidation in an oxygenrich atmosphere, with nitrogen gas used as a carrier. It was determined that a temperature of $950^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ facilitates the evaporation of Zn and its subsequent nucleation into ZnO without considering any doping. Experimental conditions were adjusted to evaluate the influence of the $N_{2}: O_{2} \\mathbf{r a t i o}$ ($\\mathbf{r}$ anging from 3:1 to 1.2:1) based on the morphology of the resulting samples. The synthesis was carried out under both static and dynamic conditions, analyzing depositions in different reactor zones. In advanced stages, silicon substrates were used to study the surface growth of $\\mathbf{Z n O}$ matrices. The particles were characterized using SEM, TEM, EDS, CL, PL, and X-ray diffraction. The analyses revealed microstructure such as tetrapods, needles, and plates, whose formation correlated with the temperature in each deposition zone and the amount of oxygen in the system. These results support the development of a simple thermodynamic growth model, with particular relevance in predicting domi-nant morphologies under controlled conditions. The presented methodology allows optimization of ZnO synthesis applications, such as in sensors and optoelectronic, where both crystalline structure and purity are important."

By integrating LiDAR-derived rooftop geometry with meteorological data resampled using monthly block bootstrapping, the method generates synthetic climatic years that preserve temporal correlations and seasonal patterns. Monte Carlo simulations propagate uncertainty in both meteorological inputs and technological PV parameters, enabling a robust assessment of energy generation potential and its variability. Results reveal an effective rooftop area of 1.19 km<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, capable of supporting approximately 173 MWp of installed capacity, with a median annual energy yield of nearly 270 GWh. A global sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices reveals that solar irradiance variability significantly governs output uncertainty, with first-order and total-order indices exceeding 0.8, whereas technological parameters have a limited influence on the output. This framework advances scientific understanding of rooftop PV variability and provides a practical tool for cities to incorporate uncertainty into renewable energy deployment strategies."

In this paper, we discuss insights from our first round of interviews with practitioners from academia. Although numerous fairness tools have been developed, only a few industry-developed (e.g., AIF360 and Fairlearn) are practically usable and commonly employed by practitioners due to regular maintenance & visibility. The existing toolkit landscape is primarily equipped to solely handle textual data and lacks sufficient resources for language models. Our findings thus far provide insights into one perspective on fairness tool engagement; our future efforts will investigate experiences and perspectives on fairness tool support beyond traditional models."

We examine whether Stephen Curry's outstanding shooting performance has had a major impact on league-wide strategies, moving gameplay away from traditional styles and toward perimeter-focused offense, using data analytics techniques and inferential statistics. Historical data from NBA seasons (1985– 2025) is used in the study. It was obtained via the NBA API and processed using Python and data cleaning procedures. We compare three-point statistics before and after Curry's breakout MVP season (2015–16) using a paired T-test, and the results show a statistically significant increase in three-point attempts and conversions. But Curry is not the only one responsible for this change. Changes in NBA regulations, transforming team dynamics, a decline of well-known rivalries, the growth of streaming services, and sports piracy are additional contributing factors. Additionally, TV ratings analysis shows that primetime viewership has declined, especially since the conclusion of legendary rivalries like Kobe vs. LeBron, while regular season viewership has remained steady. The study comes to the conclusion that, rather than being the only factor, Stephen Curry had an impact for the current NBA's shift toward efficiency, spacing, and long-range shooting.

This review analyzes studies from 2023–2025 that apply XAI to CNNs, Transformers, and hybrid models, comparing datasets, architectures, accuracy, and transparency. While notable progress has been achieved, key challenges remain, including limited benchmark datasets, domain shift, lack of clinical validation, and the computational demands of large models. Emerging research emphasizes lightweight and federated learning models, multi-center datasets, and intrinsic XAI approaches. The study highlights research gaps and advances, underscoring the need to align technical performance with clinical relevance in brain tumor analysis."

Machine learning (ML) has been proposed as a solution to detect ransomware within network traffic. Although many ML models have been developed to obtain high classification accuracy, the effectiveness of such solutions in resource-constrained environments remain a challenge. In this study, we test the runtime memory performance and inference times of common ML models. We further test the effect that training the models in a reduced feature space has on the classification and computational metrics. In this study, we evaluated multilayer perceptrons (MLP), 1- and 2-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long- and short-term memory (LSTM). Experiments were performed to give insight into each model’s ability to reduce its false positives (FPs). We find a consistent increase in memory usage as the feature space increases and that the lowest number of FPs is obtained when using 50% to 66% of the features. The study evaluates 4 models for their effectiveness in classifying ransomware network traffic. Efficiency in this context is considered a trade-off between accuracy, false positives, runtime memory usage, and inference time."

With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based cellular positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven cellular positioning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of wireless positioning and AI models, analyzing their respective challenges and synergies. We provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with a focus on the integration of AI/ML in current and upcoming standard releases. Guided by the 3GPP-defined taxonomy, we categorize and summarize state-of-the-art (SOTA) research into two major classes: AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML-based positioning. The former includes line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle prediction; the latter encompasses fingerprinting, knowledge-assisted learning, and channel charting. Furthermore, we review representative public datasets and conduct performance evaluations of AI-based positioning algorithms using these datasets. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the design and performance analysis of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling employing enhanced 5G low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, oriented toward the requirements of future 6G systems. We propose the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis for the LDPC-coded FTN system based on the Ungerboeck observation model, where the input-output mutual information function of the detector is approximated using least squares fitting. With the proposed EXIT chart analysis, we explore the thresholds and decoding performance of different LDPC codes (regular codes, irregular codes and protograph codes) in both Nyquist and FTN systems, revealing two important observational findings for FTN signaling: 1) Unlike Nyquist systems, where certain 5G New Radio (NR)-like information puncturing can enhance the decoding threshold and performance, we observe that in the FTN setting considered in this paper such puncturing leads to performance degradation; 2) Unlike Nyquist systems, the paritycheck matrix of LDPC codes optimized for FTN signaling tends to be relatively sparser within comparable ensembles, due to the intentionally introduced inter-symbol interference (ISI). Based on these findings, we develop tailored LDPC codes for FTN signaling by applying the masking operation to the base matrix of the standard 5G LDPC codes, aiming to achieve a lower decoding threshold and thereby better decoding performance. Moreover, the raptor-like structure and rate compatibility are preserved in the proposed LDPC codes, and the encoder and decoder are reused with only minor modifications. Numerical results show that: 1) All simulation results align with the decoding thresholds obtained by the proposed EXIT chart analysis, confirming the effectiveness of the analysis; 2) For the FTN system, the tailored LDPC codes outperform standard 5G LDPC codes, achieving over 0.4 dB coding gain and approaching (slightly exceeding) the constrained Nyquist capacity; 3) Under the same spectral efficiency, FTN with tailored LDPC codes performs better than standard 5G LDPC codes with Nyquist signaling, demonstrating a coding gain of up to 0.6 dB; 4) The proposed LDPC codes with the FTN signaling achieve better performance compared to existing high-performance codes specifically designed for FTN signaling."

Our results indicate that: (1) Government guidance funds are associated with productivity improvements in the renewable energy sectors. The robustness of the main findings is verified through multiple approaches addressing potential endogeneity, including propensity score matching, Heckman selection, dynamic panel, instrumental variable, and staggered difference-in-differences methods. (2) Financing capability and innovation input are two important influence paths. (3) The effects of government guidance funds on productivity promotion exhibit heterogeneity in renewable energy firms, under the influence factors including corporate risk-taking, industry competition, and regional factor markets. This study contributes to the literature on renewable energy policy incentives and government venture capital, providing theoretical and practical insights for leveraging government guidance funds to advance the low-carbon energy transition."

    "abstract": "3D scene generation is in high demand across various domains, including virtual reality, gaming, and the film industry. Owing to the powerful generative capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models that provide reliable priors, creating 3D scenes using only text prompts has become viable, thereby significantly advancing research in text-driven 3D scene generation. Prevailing methods typically employ the diffusion model to generate an initial local image, followed by iteratively outpainting the local image to gradually generate scenes. Nevertheless, these outpainting-based approaches are prone to producing globally inconsistent results with low completeness, restricting their broader applications. To tackle these problems, we introduce HoloDreamer, a framework that begins by generating a high-definition panorama to holistically initialize the full scene, and leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for rapid 3D scene reconstruction, thereby facilitating the creation of view-consistent and fully enclosed 3D scenes. Specifically, we propose Stylized Equirectangular Panorama Generation, a pipeline that combines multiple diffusion models to enable stylized and detailed equirectangular panorama generation from complex text prompts. Subsequently, Enhanced Two-Stage Panorama Reconstruction is introduced, conducting a two-stage optimization of 3D-GS to inpaint the missing region and enhance the integrity of the scene. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms prior works in terms of overall visual consistency and harmony, as well as reconstruction quality and rendering robustness when generating fully enclosed scenes."

    "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is emerging as a key enabler for intelligent transportation systems that are both latency- and energy-sensitive. This survey is motivated by the need for a unified, KPI-driven view of AI-based vehicular computation offloading that explicitly links performance gains to sustainability objectives in smart cities. We synthesize recent advances in AI-powered offloading for vehicular networks, with emphasis on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and multi-agent variants that learn adaptive, sequential policies under dynamic topology, fluctuating wireless capacity, and heterogeneous workloads. We propose a unified taxonomy that spans infrastructure-based, vehicle-assisted, and hybrid architectures; map offloading decisions to key performance dimensions (end-to-end latency, energy efficiency, reliability, throughput, and task-success rate); and formalize a minimal KPI model that links radio, compute, and caching components. The review compares algorithmic designs (DQN/DDPG/A3C/SAC, prioritized and federated variants, DRL+optimizer hybrids), scheduling granularities and baseline choices, while examining reproducibility factors such as simulators, mobility models, and dataset availability. We further discuss integration with enabling technologies (cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X)/NR-V2X, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), UAV relays, edge caching), security and privacy considerations, and the sustainability implications of AI-driven offloading for intelligent urban environments. The paper concludes with open challenges including non-stationarity, sim-to-real transfer, safety constraints, and explainability and outlines a research agenda toward robust, accountable, and resource-efficient offloading policies deployable in real world VEC systems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, video games have become a spectator activity, with e-sports and live streaming attracting large audiences. In e-sports, human commentators can enhance viewer excitement by accurately describing match situations and adjusting their speaking style to match exciting scenes. While automation of text generation from video games has been researched, generation of commentary speech that excites the audience has received little attention. To this end, we focus on modeling an e-sports commentator’s speaking style. Specifically, we propose a text-to-speech (TTS) system that can adjust the excitement level of synthetic speech on the basis of the gameplay videos. Our system consists of a TTS model and an excitement score predictor. The TTS model is trained to predict commentary speech from text and a binary excitement label. The excitement score predictor rates the excitement level of gameplay videos and feeds the binarized excitement score to the TTS model. We validate the effectiveness of our system using gameplay videos of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Subjective evaluations demonstrate that 1) our TTS model effectively controls excitement levels and 2) the TTS system enhanced the audience’s engagement and entertainment compared to a baseline TTS system."

    "abstract": "It is a practical approach using the ground–aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot’s position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground–aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared (IR) markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view (FOV) and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multisource measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures."

    "abstract": "Due to high power density, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and low filtering requirement, transformerless multilevel inverters have gained considerable interest in solar photovoltaic (PV) applications. In order to cut the flow of leakage current for a grid connection, bulky galvanic isolation based configuration is conventionally used. Instead, a transformerless configuration can effectively mitigate electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues associated to this leakage current that finds a path through parasitic capacitance existing between the PV panels and the ground. In this context, this work presents a novel resource optimized five-level transformerless inverter topology in which ac side decoupling is exploited and it is compared with few existing five-level transformerless inverter topologies. The presented inverter also exhibits reduced conduction and switching losses. A state-of-the-art modulation strategy is developed which not only ensure leakage current suppression in accordance to VDE-0126-1-1 standard but also able to control dc bus midpoint voltage by applying redundant switching states in a simple manner. The inverter’s performance is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB and PLECS environments. Furthermore, a scaled-down lab prototype has been developed to validate its functionality."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) primarily consist of weight-intensive fully-connected (FC) layers and cache-dependent attention layers. While batching significantly enhances the throughput of FC layers, it paradoxically increases the cache demands of attention layers. This provides no performance benefit and creates substantial memory pressure. Consequently, existing GPU-based LLM acceleration systems face throughput limitations from batch size constraints. Even when DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) is employed to accelerate attention, the utilization remains extremely low under small batch sizes, which is unsuitable for low batch scenarios. Fortunately, the emerging non-volatile RRAM technology offers batch size-insensitive acceleration for FC layers through highly parallel in-situ computations by eliminating weight loading overhead. This insight leads us to propose a hybrid approach: RRAM for FC layers and DRAM PIM for attention layers to overcome batch size limitations. However, merely scaling existing RRAM architectures misaligned with LLMs’ computation and storage demands will result in prohibitive overheads. Meanwhile, existing DRAM-based PIMs suffer from poor resource utilization due to the computational pattern of attention layers. Implementing an effective scheduling strategy is equally crucial to harness the potential of the hybrid PIM system. To address these challenges, we present DuoPIM, a novel RRAM-DRAM hybrid PIM architecture optimized for LLM decoding. We introduce novel architectural innovations for both the RRAM and DRAM PIM components to address the challenges posed by LLMs. Specifically, we decouple RRAM’s storage and computing capabilities within a hierarchical architecture, implement minimal modifications to DRAM PIM to support online softmax, and devise dedicated strategies across multiple architectural levels to enhance overall resource utilization. Evaluations demonstrate DuoPIM’s ability to fully leverage computing capacity across various batch sizes."

    "abstract": "Robotic automation in high-mix, low-volume settings often relies on structured workcells where fixtures, workpieces, and procedures are well defined, but tasks must be reconfigured quickly across variants. This paper presents the Design and Learning Research Group's solution to the euROBIN Manipulation Skill Versatility Challenge (MSVC) at IROS 2024, in which a standardized electronic task board is operated through a fixed sequence of subtasks. We deliberately adopt a simple, industry-style implementation: each subtask is taught by recording an open-loop Tool Center Point (TCP) and gripper trajectory in the task-board frame, a wrist-mounted depth camera is used once per run to localize the board and a few key features, and a web dashboard exposes the resulting motion primitives as reusable code blocks that can be reordered and reparameterized. With this pipeline, our system completes the benchmark in 28.2 s in the lab (37.2 s on-site), compared to a human baseline of 16.3 s and an average of 83.5 s for previous teams, closing a large part of the performance gap without advanced learning or feedback control. We further demonstrate limited skill transfer by retargeting the same subtask library to a smoke-detector battery replacement scenario required by the competition. Finally, we release our implementation as open source and discuss how competition design and benchmark structure influence the balance between simple engineered solutions and richer sensing and learning."

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have shown tremendous success in numerous computer vision applications; however, they have not been exploited for stress assessment using physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG). In order to get the maximum benefit from the vision transformer for multilevel stress assessment, in this paper, we transform the raw ECG data into 2D spectrograms using short time Fourier transform (STFT). These spectrograms are divided into patches for feeding to the transformer encoder. We also perform experiments with 1D CNN and ResNet-18 (CNN model). We perform leave-one-subject-out cross validation (LOSOCV) experiments on WESAD and Ryerson Multimedia Lab (RML) dataset. One of the biggest challenges of LOSOCV based experiments is to tackle the problem of intersubject variability. In this research, we address the issue of intersubject variability and show our success using 2D spectrograms and the attention mechanism of transformer. Experiments show that vision transformer handles the effect of intersubject variability much better than CNN-based models and beats all previous state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Moreover, our method is end-to-end, does not require handcrafted features, and can learn robust representations. The proposed method achieved 71.01% and 76.7% accuracies with RML dataset and WESAD dataset respectively for three class classification and 88.3% for binary classification on WESAD."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers day-and-night capability for ship recognition, but its scattering mechanism results in limited textural and spectral detail compared to optical imagery, hindering fine-grained semantic interpretation and recognition. Existing cross-modal transfer methods mainly align features or pixels between SAR and optical imagery, yet they fail to guarantee semantic consistency across modalities. To address this, we propose a Semantic-anchored Cross-modal Distillation Framework (SCDF) with foundation models. SCDF introduces textual semantic descriptors for each ship category as semantic anchors to ensure cross-modal semantic consistency, while incorporating scattering topology maps into SAR images, thus enabling effective transfer without sacrificing modality-specific discriminability. Within this framework, a language foundation model encodes semantic anchors into text embeddings as class references, formulating ship recognition as aligning visual features with semantic anchors. To enhance the alignment between SAR features and anchors, a scattering-aware student model integrates scattering topology maps with SAR imagery, emphasizing key ship structures. This alignment is further guided by a vision foundation model acting as the optical teacher, which provides reliable optical-semantic similarity for distillation. Instead of simply transferring labels or features, the semantic-anchored distillation transfers semantic discriminability from the optical domain to SAR while preserving SAR-specific scattering topology features. Extensive experiments on the FUSAR-Ship dataset and fine-grained optical datasets (FGSC-23 and FGSCR-42) demonstrate that SCDF effectively bridges SAR and optical imagery and enhances SAR ship recognition."

    "abstract": "Debugging is an essential yet often tedious part of the software development process. Omniscient debuggers have long aimed to make debugging easier by recording execution traces, enabling more direct debugging interactions. Although the concept of omniscient debugging has been explored extensively in research, it has seen limited adoption in industry until recently. The emergence of new commercial tools like Replay presents an opportunity to reevaluate the impact of omniscient debugging. In this paper, we conducted a controlled experiment with 20 participants with a commercial omniscient debugger, Replay, and a traditional debugger, Chrome DevTools. We investigated whether the omniscient debugger improved developer productivity and how it influenced debugging behavior. We coded developers’ navigation, rerun, and runtime value collection behaviors and summarized their debugging strategies. Our results show that developers with the omniscient debugger were not more successful or faster than those using the traditional debugger. Omniscient debugger users reran the program less, but there was no significant difference in the number of files or functions they explored or the number of runtime values they collected. Omniscient debugger users faced navigation and runtime value collection challenges, which may have hindered their effectiveness. Our results suggest that commercial omniscient debuggers must include more of the high-level support for interacting with traces found in research prototypes to successfully help developers in debugging tasks."

    "abstract": "Various programming environments feature live programming as a central part of their programming experience. Liveness in these environments is analyzed by several theories, which describe the different forms of liveness and how they influence the programming experience. Unfortunately, these are isolated theories only concerned with live programming features. They can not explain liveness in terms of general interactions with programming tools.One theory that has successfully explained how programmers interact with various kinds of tools is information foraging theory (IFT). In this paper, we propose an IFT interpretation of liveness. By interpreting liveness in terms of a more comprehensive theory of programmer behavior, we can explain the role of liveness in common software development activities such as debugging.We have explored our IFT interpretation of liveness in a first controlled experiment. We investigated the hypothesis that when we remove liveness from live dynamic introspection tools, programmers will use them less often, as using them has a higher cost. We have conducted a post hoc analysis of the results for which we used the edit-run-cycle model adapted to analyze the usage of live programming tools. The post hoc results hint that programmers did shift away from introspection tools. While our study only features post hoc results, it suggests that the IFT interpretation of liveness is a fruitful avenue."

Through a narrative literature review, this study compares the effectiveness of culinary experiments with conventional labs in promoting student engagement, enhancing conceptual understanding, managing instructional resources, and communicating science. The findings indicate that cooking-based approaches significantly increase student participation and satisfaction, fostering a more active learning environment. These methods facilitate tangible, hands-on experiences that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application across various engineering disciplines. Furthermore, culinary experiments show preliminary reductions in material costs by utilizing household items and everyday ingredients, making scientific exploration more accessible, especially in resource-constrained settings. However, adopting cooking laboratories entails increased preparation time for instructors and requires careful integration to ensure that the students meet the learning objectives effectively. The review also highlights the importance of designing hybrid models that combine the strengths of both traditional and culinary approaches to optimize educational outcomes. This research underscores the significance of innovative pedagogical strategies that utilize familiar, everyday activities to pique interest in STEM fields, while offering meaningful and costeffective learning experiences. The insights gained aim to inform curriculum development and promote the adoption of experiential, interdisciplinary teaching methods that align with modern educational needs."

However, ECG signals are often corrupted by noise, including power line interference, and electromyographic artifacts, which compromise accuracy. Wavelet-based denoising offers an effective solution due to its ability to process non-stationary signals, but its performance strongly depends on the choice of mother wavelet and decomposition level. This study compares the denoising performance of seven mother wavelets-sym8, sym5, db4, db6, bior3.7, bior6.8, and coif5-on ECG signals under varying noise conditions. The evaluation employs multiple metrics, including Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Cross-Correlation (CC), Percent Root Difference (PRD), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and QRS Preservation Score (QPS). Results indicate that coif5 achieves the best noise suppression across most metrics (SNR 4.71 dB, CC $97.11 \\%$) but at the expense of QRS morphology preservation (QPS 93.5%). In contrast, bior3.7 performs poorly at low SNR but excels in preserving QRS features at higher SNR, while bior6.8 shows balanced performance across all metrics (SNR 4.52 dB, CC 96.97%, and QPS 94.30%). These findings emphasize the trade-off between noise reduction and preservation of diagnostic features in ECG denoising and provide a basis for future work evaluating its impact on convolutional neural networks based ECG classification."

To obtain future PWV information, a short-time troposphere PWV forecast model combined empirical model and spatiotemporal ConvLSTM network is developed based on ERA5 PWV data from 2019 to 2022 to forecast PWV in the next several hours. Firstly, the Fourier transform is introduced to construct an empirical model for the periodic variations in the PWV time series, enhancing the interpretability of the forecast model. The periodic component is removed from the ERA5 PWV to obtain the residual term without obvious patterns. A ConvLSTM deep learning network is employed to learn its spatiotemporal variations and build a residual forecast model. Finally, the empirical and ConvLSTM models are combined to obtain the short-term tropospheric PWV forecast model named PWVFnet. The forecasted PWV is validated using 2023 ERA5 PWV data. The numerical results show that the RMSE, STD, and MAE values of the 1-step forecasted PWV achieve 2.54 mm, 2.53 mm, and 1.82 mm, respectively. Similar results are presented to those of GNSS PWV. The model is further validated during quiet and active tropospheric periods, with forecast accuracies of 1.88 mm and 3.58 mm, respectively. The model's accuracy is better than 3 mm when the forecast horizon does not exceed 6 hours. Interestingly, it is found that intense tropospheric changes hinder the precise forecasting of ConvLSTM, but reducing the forecast region can mitigate the adverse effects caused by complex tropospheric variations."

    "abstract": "The importance of quarry geology and chemistry gets quickly overlooked when it comes to the actual production of cement. Attention is typically only paid to the quarry when there is a problem that negatively impacts cement production. Quarry modeling and mine planning are often neglected and underfunded due to a lack understanding of the chemical characteristics of the quarry in the overall production of cement. A representative block model, based on exploration drilling data or production drill data, and a mine plan that is regularly reviewed and updated can potentially save millions of dollars. By communicating and working together between plant and quarry personnel, you can prolong the life of the quarry, which prolongs the life of the plant. Better understanding of the challenges quarries face daily, might just make your job easier."

    "abstract": "Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose automated neural architecture design (AutoNAD), an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multilayer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. In addition, a searchable multilevel feature aggregation module is integrated to enhance multiscale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform."

Conventional tensor decomposition-based channel prediction methods often suffer from significant errors due to unified subspace projections that ignore structural heterogeneity induced by channel sparsity. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework that explicitly leverages temporal row-sparse in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel tensors. First, a constrained Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) decouples the channel into sparse (dominant paths) and diffused (scattered multipath) components. Then, Tucker decomposition is used to predict the joint subspace of the sparse part, while a spatio-temporal autoregressive model handles the diffused part. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves prediction accuracy and enhances transmission robustness in dynamic environments by effectively modeling channel heterogeneity."

    "abstract": "In this work, a novel dual-type reference governor (DRG) is proposed to handle the unreachable reference within the prediction horizon for the model predictive control (MPC). The proposed method, featuring two types of reference governor (RG) designs, ensures efficient reference tracking and MPC feasibility throughout the entire process. The first type, the initial RG, is specifically designed to adjust references when the controller receives a new target reference. This addresses a gap in existing research on command/feasibility governors (FGs), which overlooks this scenario. The second type, named terminal RG, ensures the convergence of auxiliary references to the current target reference. By introducing control variables, it expands the feasible set of auxiliary references compared to existing methods, thereby further accelerating the convergence speed. The recursive feasibility, finite-time convergence, and asymptotic stability of the combined DRG+MPC closed-loop system with the proposed algorithm are demonstrated in the article. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, numerical simulations were conducted in two vehicle application scenarios: adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane changing control (LCC), using their respective vehicle models. The results indicate that, compared to existing methods such as classical MPC, tracking MPC (TMPC), and FG+MPC, the proposed approach guarantees both reference tracking performance and low computational burden."

Considering task latency and the number of semantic symbols, the framework constructs a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is transformed into two subproblems. First, we innovatively propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization task offloading optimization method based on parametric distribution noise (MAPPO-PDN) to solve the optimization problem of the number of semantic symbols; second, linear programming (LP) is used to optimize the offloading ratio. Simulations show that performance of this scheme is superior to that of other algorithms."

Polarimetric measurements provide valuable information about atmospheric phenomena. The cross-channel correlation between horizontal and vertical polarized signals allows the detection of noise-only range cells, since weather signals typically exhibit high correlation whereas noise does not. Based on this principle, the proposed approach replaces the median filtering in Beauchamp’s method with an iterative adaptive F-test, improving robustness to outliers. The algorithm is evaluated against both Beauchamp’s polarization-based scheme and Ivic’s non-polarimetric method, demonstrating that it achieves a well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Results using both simulated and real radar data support its suitability for operational implementation."

    "abstract": "High-rate short-length error correction codes are crucial for ultralow-latency communication (ULLC) applications prevalent in next-generation communication systems. Recent promising developments in this regard include the code-agnostic family of guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) decoders. However, they are not directly applicable to multiuser communication scenarios (e.g., in 5G and 6G) characterized by nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). To address this gap, we propose a novel multiuser ordered symbol switch (MOSS)-GRAND decoder operating on symbols (instead of bits) to jointly decode the information of a pair of users accessing the channel using NOMA. We also propose a NOMA-successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoder as a conventional straightforward adaptation of GRAND-based decoders to the NOMA setup. Comparing MOSS-GRAND with NOMA-SIC, we show that the former is amenable to higher throughput due to parallelization and is therefore preferred over the latter for the target ULLC applications. The algorithm is translated into a low-latency hardware architecture, where the distance between the received message and all candidate codewords is calculated in parallel to optimize performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the MOSS-GRAND decoder provides improvements between <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$5.70\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$117.51\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> in throughput, with area reductions between <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.88\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$789.79\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> compared to traditional GRAND-based decoders adapted for NOMA.

Instead of the conventional single-model approach in direct code generation, our DMoT method decomposes the task into a hierarchy of subtasks using hierarchical Multi-Level Reasoning (MLR) graphs. Each phase, from solving simple subproblems to verifying syntax and compliance with initial requirements, is handled by a dedicated fine-tuned model. Models were trained through knowledge distillation from a larger model (ChatGPT-4.1) using a quantized LoRA technique, enabling execution on accessible hardware. Experimental evaluation is conducted on the BigCodeBench benchmark, which includes realistic and complex programming tasks. These results show that a system composed of several specialized small models outperforms single-model approaches in terms of accuracy (pass@1) and structural quality (CodeBLEU). So, small fine-tuned language models can rival and even outperform larger models, offering a resource-efficient path in the code generation processes."

    "abstract": "Fixed damping strategies are inadequate for suppressing the DC-link capacitor ripple current in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives across a wide power range. Therefore, a ripple current suppression strategy based on adaptive active damping with iterative learning is proposed. The strategy indirectly characterizes the ripple current by the DC-link voltage, avoiding the need for additional sensors or current reconstruction algorithms. Firstly, the limitation of fixed damping in suppressing the ripple current is revealed using the equivalent admittance model. Then, an adaptive suppression mechanism based on P-type iterative learning is constructed. The balance between the convergence speed and the disturbance rejection capability is achieved by introducing a forgetting factor. On this basis, the initial admittance parameters are dynamically matched to improve the iterative efficiency under variable-speed conditions. The analysis of convergence and parameter sensitivity demonstrates that the proposed strategy exhibits rapid convergence, high accuracy, and strong robustness. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified on the experimental platform."

By leveraging geographic location data, these networks can opportunistically select forwarding nodes, a strategy that proves particularly effective in the dynamic and unpredictable nature of IoUT. However, uncertainty in forwarder selection and the inability to verify nodes’ claimed positions remain critical challenges. This paper investigates how uncertainty in next-hop selection arises in Geo-OR when viewed from the perspective of potential adversaries operating in a non-cooperative manner. By integrating an octree-based search strategy with an angle-constrained 3D localization algorithm, we accurately identify and locate “hot” nodes within Geo-OR. Geometric methods are employed to analyze vulnerable relay regions, pinpointing areas especially susceptible to malicious attacks. Based on this analysis, a location spoofing attack is proposed to disrupt legitimate node transmissions and degrade network performance. Simulation results reveal that the inherent uncertainties in Geo-OR expose the network to significant vulnerabilities, severely compromising throughput. This study highlights the critical weaknesses of Geo-OR, offering valuable insights into the most vulnerable regions and contributing to the design of targeted defense strategies to mitigate these risks."

The behavior of the system is analyzed under three control schemes: a conventional one with split PI control, and two alternative schemes called Input Position Control (IPC) and One Controller per Input (OCI). The validation is performed in Matlab/Simulink under variable load and input voltage conditions, using metrics such as rise time, overshoot, stabilization time, root mean square error, and efficiency. The results show that the OCI scheme offers the best overall dynamic response and conversion efficiency, followed by conventional PI control. This study contributes to the development of robust and efficient controllers for multiinput converters applicable in DC microgrids, hybrid storage, and electric vehicles."

    "abstract": "Public procurement systems generate large, complex datasets that can reveal corruption risks; however, analyzing these datasets is challenging due to unstructured formats, fragmented sources, and technical barriers. This paper introduced a data pipeline that streamlines the processing of procurement data from Ecuador’s Official Public Procurement System (SOCE, for its acronym in Spanish), expanding on the Kapak project, which uses big data and data science to promote transparency. Specifically, Kapak implements a web crawler that periodically collects extensive procurement data from Ecuador’s public procurement website SOCE. Nevertheless, its raw format-comprising base64encoded USHAY files, fragmented documents, and scattered JSON files-hinders effective analysis. To address this, our pipeline automates decoding, file reconstruction, and dataset consolidation, thereby ensuring that the data is ready for analysis. Subsequently, we evaluated, the pipeline on Reverse Electronic Auction (REA) documents, using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to detect patterns among high-risk procurement processes. The analysis specifically focused on technical specifications, bid documents, and stakeholder Question and Answer (Q&A) records. Overall, the pipeline offers a generalizable, modular framework that shifts focus from preprocessing to analysis. In addition, it supports integration with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, making it a valuable tool for corruption detection and public procurement oversight."

These incidents compromise sensitive data, disrupt clinical workflows, and pose risks to patient safety. While commercial security platforms exist, few solutions are tailored to the specific requirements of healthcare environments, particularly regarding IoMT integration and compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging European Union directives. This paper develops a conceptual framework for the analysis of cyberattacks in hospital networks. The framework integrates regulatory compliance requirements, IoMT-specific security considerations, and architectural principles inspired by Zero Trust. The study builds on a literature review and case studies of recent cyber incidents to propose a structured design that can guide the development of healthcare-specific monitoring and analysis platforms.

    "abstract": "Small power systems like the Tambora grid are very sensitive to frequency problems that happen when a generator suddenly stops working. To fix this, an adaptive load shedding method was created. This method finds the best way to reduce power in real time. First, the system uses a model based on swing equations to estimate the total power imbalance. This model takes into account things like system inertia, normal frequency, and how quickly the frequency is changing (ROCOF). Then, a scaling factor is applied to the power loss, showing how much power needs to be cut. This scaling factor is improved using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Each possible solution is tested in DIgSILENT PowerFactory using Python to make sure the final steady-state frequency stays above 49.6 Hz. To improve voltage performance, the Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) is calculated for all load buses before any disturbance occurs. These values are adjusted and used to rank buses based on how likely they are to experience voltage issues. Once the total power to cut is decided, it is spread out in a way that gives more cuts to the buses with the highest FVSI values. This makes sure the system not only deals with a drop in frequency but also avoids voltage instability in weak parts of the grid. The combined method improves both frequency and voltage stability, making it good for use as a Special Protection Scheme (SPS) in specific emergencies to stop a widespread power outage."

    "abstract": "The rising share of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the Bulgarian energy mix without enough energy storage capacities leads to falling electricity prices, when more energy is produced by PV plants. This leads to lower rate of return on the invested capital in PV capacities, which is expected to slow down their further market penetration. An analysis of the dependance of the rate of return on the investment of 12.6 kW peak PV system on the hourly changes in the free-market electricity prices for 2023 and 2024 is done. The conclusions are that the PV system generated 0.8% less energy in 2024, but returned 24.84% less value, while the average energy price for 2024 is only 1.77% lower. This can only be due to the 32.7 % higher PV share in the Bulgarian energy mix and to the even higher connected PV powers to the power grid, which led to 65% higher PV power share of the total gross electricity production for 2024, which pushes the electricity prices to lower values at the times when the PV capacities generate the significant amount of energy. The PV capacity share in the Bulgarian energy mix for 2024 is 28.8% without significant amount of energy storage capacities. A level of 30% could be considered a limit value above which PV systems become uncompetitive, at least at the current prices. One of the promising cost-effective solutions is the rising number of EVs to be used as energy storage capacities, when parked."

The SRR enhances electromagnetic coupling, while the DGS improves impedance matching and bandwidth by suppressing unwanted resonances. Simulations indicate a return loss of −31 dB at 5.9 GHz, a wide impedance bandwidth of 2.85 GHz, and a peak gain of −2.8 dBi. Although the gain is modest compared with larger antennas, it is sufficient for short-range IoT gateways, smart sensors, and compact 5G devices, where small form factor and wideband compliance is more critical than high directive gain. The results demonstrate that SRR- and DGS-based techniques provide an effective approach for antenna miniaturization and wideband operation, offering a promising solution for next-generation compact wireless systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of industrial digitalization has made secure and efficient authentication mechanisms for resource-constrained Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices increasingly important. However, existing authentication schemes often suffer from high computational overhead, limited adaptability to dynamic industrial environments, and delayed detection of credential compromises. To address these challenges, this article proposes a lightweight, adaptive, and security-enhanced authentication scheme tailored for IIoT systems. The scheme integrates physical unclonable function (PUF) technology for hardware-level security, applies SSS to manage PUF response instability, and incorporates a honeyword mechanism for proactive password leakage detection. Formal security analyses using BAN logic and ProVerif, along with heuristic assessments, demonstrate the scheme’s robustness against common IIoT threats, including impersonation, replay, and password-guessing attacks. Experimental results indicate that, under the stated assumptions and implementation settings, our scheme exhibits lower simulated computational cost (10.855 ms) and achieves an estimated sensor-node energy of 0.466 mJ on MICAz using Shim’s methodology. Taken together, these results indicate strong security with improved efficiency, suggesting practicality for evolving IIoT deployments."

    "abstract": "Active distribution networks facilitating bidirectional power exchange with renewable energy resources are susceptible to cyberattacks due to integration of a diverse array of cyber components. This study introduces a grid-level defense strategy aimed at enhancing attack resiliency based on distribution network planning. Our proposed framework imposes a security requirement into existing planning methodologies, ensuring that voltage deviation from its rated value remains within a tolerable range against dynamically and maliciously injected power at end-user nodes. Unfortunately, the formulated problem in its original form is intractable because it is an infinite-dimensional bi-level optimization problem over a function space. To address this complexity, we develop an equivalent transformation into a tractable form as mixed- integer linear program leveraging linear dynamical system theory and graph theory. Notably, our investigation reveals that the severity of potential attacks hinges solely on the cumulative reactances over the path from the substation to the targeted node, thereby reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional problem. Further, the bi-level optimization problem is reduced to a single-level optimization problem by using a technique utilized in solving the shortest path problem. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted on a 54-node distribution network benchmark, our proposed methodology exhibits a noteworthy 29.3% enhancement in the resiliency, with a mere 2.1% uptick in the economic cost."

In LAWNs, satellites with wide coverage and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility can complement each other to form integrated satellite-UAV networks, thereby providing ubiquitous and high-speed connectivity for low-altitude operations. However, the higher line-of-sight probability in low-altitude airspace increases transmission security concerns. In this work, we present a collaborative beamforming-based physical layer security scheme for LAWNs. We introduce the fundamental aspects of integrated satellite-UAV networks, physical layer security, UAV swarms, and collaborative beamforming for LAWN applications. Following this, we highlight several opportunities for collaborative UAV swarm secure applications enabled by satellite networks, including achieving physical layer security in scenarios involving data dissemination, data relay, eavesdropper collusion, and imperfect eavesdropper information. Next, we detail two case studies, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, a secure relay system and a two-way aerial secure communication framework specifically designed for LAWN environments. Simulation results demonstrate that these physical layer security schemes are effective and beneficial for secure low-altitude wireless communications. A practicality analysis shows that the proposed method is applicable to LAWN scenarios. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions for enhancing security in LAWNs."

    "abstract": "Transient Overvoltage (TOV) poses significant safety risks to both substation equipment and personnel. Accurate measurement provides an essential reference for overvoltage protection. At present, the outer shield of the test cable used for potential leads is typically grounded at both ends to the ground grid (Method 1) to suppress external magnetic field interference. However, TOV events are usually accompanied by strong Ground Potential Rise (GPR), which causes interference currents on the shield due to Ground Potential Difference (GPD), leading to measurement errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes an alternative grounding scheme in which the outer shield is connected in parallel with a metal return wire (Method 2), thereby mitigating the impact of GPD. A numerical calculation model for evaluating the Shielding Effectiveness (SE) of the test cable under both interference magnetic fields and GPD was developed. The SEs of Method 1 and Method 2 were analyzed in both the frequency domain and under typical transient magnetic field waveforms in the time domain. The results show that, for each GPD frequency, there exists a characteristic interference magnetic field frequency <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>. When the magnetic field frequency is lower than <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>, Method 2 achieves significantly higher SE than Method 1; when it is higher than <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i>, the SE of the two methods becomes nearly identical. Under typical magnetic fields, Method 2 consistently outperforms Method 1, with a maximum SE difference of 28 dB observed under a ringing wave condition. In practice, the selection of the test cable shield grounding method during TOV testing at generation and transformer substations should be based on the dominant frequency of the interfering magnetic field and the amplitude and frequency of GPD. For Transient Ground Potential Rise (TGPR) tests, Method 2 is strongly recommended."

    "abstract": "With the advent of innovative technologies, smart city video surveillance systems are prevailing increasingly. These systems collect extensive amounts of data using cameras and sensors strategically placed throughout the city. They typically utilize artificial intelligence models that are developed on a classical machine learning approach in which data is collected and shared for model development. This centralized data dissemination raises significant concerns about data leakage, confidentiality, and privacy. In addition, various existing surveillance systems are designed to detect a single type of anomaly, limiting their versatility and effectiveness. To address these limitations, this study introduces a privacy preserving framework for smart city video surveillance – CityFederate, which is designed to detect multiple anomalies without the need for raw data sharing. CityFederate utilizes a federated learning approach that allows the model to be developed by sharing its parameters instead of the raw data, thus maintaining privacy and confidentiality of data. This approach eliminates the need for centralized data collection while enabling the development of a global model capable of generalizing across heterogeneous and distributed datasets typically in smart city environments. A comprehensive survey was conducted to identify the requirements of a robust smart city surveillance system. These requirements lay down the foundation of the CityFederate framework. A testbed was created to evaluate the efficacy of the CityFederate using a self-curated dataset under two data distributions across two learning environments: federated and distributed (local training only). The global model in the federated environment achieved an overall accuracy of 95% on random data and 86% on balanced data. Furthermore, it successfully detected previously unseen anomalies excluded during training, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness compared to isolated local models. These results demonstrate that CityFederate can identify various unusual events in distributed environments while ensuring privacy, scalability, cost efficiency, and collaborative processing, making it a robust and practical framework for smart city surveillance."

    "abstract": "Automotive cameras provide rich visual data to ensure safe function deployment in ADSs (Automated Driving Systems), especially with regard to perception functions. With the increasing demand to accurately perceive the surrounding environment, cameras generate significant volumes of data, causing bandwidth bottlenecks in the automotive wired communication networks. To avoid expensive hardware / cable upgrades, we propose hereby using video compression, and specifically <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Bayer compression</i>, to reduce the amount of data to be transferred. Bayer compression indicates a special compression scheme utilising the Bayer data pipeline, in contrast to conventional compression schemes using RGB or YCbCr data, mainly for human vision. Bayer is the colour format of raw data captured after camera and before ISP (Image Signal Processing). Bayer data are smaller than RGB data, and recent work demonstrated that it can be directly fed into an automotive perception system. This paper presents novel computational-effective Colour Space Transform (CST) Bayer adaptation techniques, preserving the pixel-correlation by full luma channel, and out-performing other SOTA techniques in terms of image quality and performance when evaluated by downstream perception task. And they can be directly consumable by widely used compression codecs, H.264 and JPEG. The quality of Bayer data compression is evaluated on IQA (Image Quality Assessment) metrics and perception focused downstream tasks, in particularly object detection. With limited colour distortion, the two proposed CSTs achieve the best compression/detection results compared to other SOTA methods at compression ratios of 4.10:1 and 3.86:1 in H.264 with different deep neural network architectures."

However, this process can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large and complex programs. To that end, we introduce AutoPrint, a tool that automatically inserts and removes print statements to streamline print statement debugging in Java code. We conducted a judgment study with 23 participants—students and practitioners—to elicit feedback on AutoPrint and gain insights on its utility in practical debugging tasks. Our results show participants perceive AutoPrint saves debugging time and effort through a faster, simpler, and more usable tool compared to other approaches."

    "abstract": "A method is presented to continuously estimate the efficiency of residential Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) within Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) during run time. It relies solely on State-of-Charge (SoC) and AC power measurements, requiring no additional tests or sensors. The algorithm reconstructs charge-discharge cycles by identifying intervals in which the SoC returns to a previous value with exactly one intermediate extremum. It integrates AC power on both sides of that extremum to approximate the system’s round-trip efficiency. The quality is assessed via SoC constraints, mean power, and a variability rating to filter unreliable estimates. The approach is implemented in a HEMS simulation and assessed with a one year-long real PV/load dataset (900 s resolution), reproducing the expected power-dependent efficiency of a dummy system. Laboratory validation on two commercial AC-coupled systems with independent high-precision AC metering confirms feasibility across the whole operating range. Findings indicate that continuous efficiency updates reduce model mismatch for scheduling and improve robustness of multi-objective HEMS optimisation. The simulation results indicate that the efficiency estimation achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.024."

These configurations are error-prone and require substantial expertise, posing a barrier especially to novices. In this paper, we introduce PipeBlocks, a block-based CI/CD tool featuring a graphical interface for visually constructing pipelines through modular, drag-and-drop blocks. PipeBlocks seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions, allowing users to design, validate, and execute pipelines entirely within the tool while maintaining full compatibility with existing YAML workflows. A key innovation is the ability to trigger and monitor pipeline runs directly in PipeBlocks, eliminating context-switching."

    "abstract": "One persistent challenge in programming instruction is ensuring students correctly apply taught concepts during exercises. To address this issue, we enhanced an existing instructor dashboard to detect misapplication solutions-submissions that meet the requirements but misapply core concepts. We developed two complementary detection approaches. The first is a new reference-based method that embeds programs using instructordefined keywords (e.g., for, if, else) and identifies misapplications via an embedding and clustering algorithm. While effective, this approach requires instructors to (a) choose keywords, (b) label misapplications in prior student solutions, and (c) reuse unaltered problems. To mitigate these drawbacks, we introduce a referencefree method, novel in this area, that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to detect misapplications without prior training or access to other student solutions. We evaluated both methods, along with a baseline edit-distance clustering technique, on two labeled programming exercises. In quantitative evaluations, our referencebased method outperformed the reference-free approach, but the reference-free method achieved similar results while avoiding the reference-based method’s limitations. We further evaluated both new approaches for in-progress misapplication detection and found similar results. To reduce instructor effort in the reference-based approach, we used an LLM to generate concept keywords from problem descriptions automatically. We found them accurate when used in our evaluations. Lastly, we examined the monetary cost of the reference-free approach and outlined tradeoffs to help instructors choose an approach based on effort, budget, and performance. This work contributes two novel misapplication-detection methods, demonstrates human-AI synergy to reduce instructor burden, and explores augmenting instructor user interfaces to improve their usefulness."

    "abstract": "The Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry encounters multiple obstacles because of its intricate supply networks, diverse product range, new product introduction (NPI) process, and fast-paced market environment. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems traditionally provide transactional backbone support - managing inventory, procurement, production, quality, and financial flows. However, EMS also requires vast integration of physical shop-floor data into ERP. The Digital Twin (DT) technology creates virtual copies of physical assets to simulate the processes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled ERP systems use simulation results for automated decision-making. Unlike prior work that addresses DT with manufacturing execution system (MES) integration, this paper establishes a conceptual novel framework which unites DT with AI-enabled ERP systems to enhance EMS operational performance by using live production visibility, AI scheduling engine, predictive maintenance, quality assurance, and supply chain optimization. The architecture proposes five layers – Physical, Digital Twin, MES, ERP and AI-ERP-Orchestration layer to perform dynamic scheduling, proactive resource allocation, and data-based quality control. The framework addresses key challenges – data interoperability, cybersecurity, scalability, and trust in AI. Industrial use cases demonstrate potential process improvements with use of DT & AI. The paper addresses future research paths which involve testing the methods empirically, creating unified integration methods and developing DT-AI-ERP systems for decision-making support tailored to EMS industry."

A key challenge in mobile networks is ensuring seamless mobility and consistent Quality of Service (QoS) for users, particularly at the cell edge. This paper investigates handover management strategies within a simulated O-RAN environment. We conduct a comparative performance analysis between a traditional, eNB-controlled A3-RSRP handover mechanism and a traffic steering policy enforced by a custom xApp on the Near-RT RIC. Using the ns-3 simulator with the ns-O-RAN module, we demonstrate that a simple, reactive RSRPbased logic, whether implemented in the eNB or the xApp, is insufficient for preventing Radio Link Failures (RLF) for mobile users, resulting in packet loss rates exceeding 90%. We then introduce a proactive, QoS-aware xApp that utilizes richer radio link quality indicators to preemptively manage mobility. Simulation results show that this intelligent xApp successfully mitigates RLF, drastically reducing packet loss, decreasing latency by $24 \\%$, and improving user throughput by $42 \\%$. This work underscores the critical need for proactive intelligence within xApps to fully realize the potential of O-RAN for dynamic network optimization."

A modular control architecture orchestrates all components, and signal chains are implemented in GNU Radio with custom Python tooling. The testbed supports Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission and per-packet Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) estimation. Experiments were conducted in four bands ($2.5,2.9,3.2$, and 3.7 GHz) under varied spatial layouts. Results show that RF spatial fingerprints based on RSSI are consistently recoverable across all bands, indicating the platform’s ability to generate robust Radio-Frequency Patterns (RFPs) for tasks such as user localization and hardware identification via pattern recognition. The study also quantifies frequency-dependent attenuation and antenna-specific responses, offering practical guidance for deploying RFP-based systems in real-world environments."

Although current research mostly emphasizes English, the linguistic and cultural biases inherent in Global South languages, like Bengali, are little examined. This research seeks to examine the characteristics and magnitude of gender bias in Bengali, evaluating the efficacy of current approaches in identifying and alleviating Bias. We use several methods to extract gender-biased utterances, including lexicon-based mining, computational classification models, translation-based comparison analysis, and GPT-based bias creation. Our research indicates that the straight application of English-centric bias detection frameworks to Bengali is severely constrained by language disparities and socio-cultural factors that impact implicit biases. To tackle these difficulties, we executed two field investigations inside rural and lowincome areas, gathering authentic insights on gender Bias. The findings demonstrate that gender Bias in Bengali presents distinct characteristics relative to English, requiring a more localized and context-sensitive methodology. Additionally, our research emphasizes the need of integrating community-driven research approaches to identify culturally relevant biases often neglected by automated systems. Our research enhances the ongoing discussion around gender bias in AI by illustrating the need to create linguistic tools specifically designed for underrepresented languages. This study establishes a foundation for further investigations into bias reduction in Bengali and other Indic languages, promoting the development of more inclusive and fair NLP systems."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has been widely studied in recent years. However, most existing MAPF algorithms assume that an agent occupies only a single cell in a grid-based map. This assumption limits their applicability in many real-world domains where agents have geometric shapes rather than being point-like. These agents, which can occupy multiple cells simultaneously, are referred to as “large” agents. When considering the shape and size of agents in MAPF, i.e., MAPF for large agents (LA-MAPF), the computational complexity increases significantly as the number of agents increases, primarily because of the increased overhead in conflict detection between geometric agents. This paper introduces Layered Decomposition, a method that decomposes a MAPF problem into subproblems through iterative bipartitioning. This approach aims to reduce the time cost when solving LA-MAPF problems. To address unsolvable subproblems, we propose a solvability safeguard mechanism that merges subproblems until a solvable subproblem is formed. Experiments show that our LA-MAPF method with decomposition reduces time cost and increases the success rate of state-of-art MAPF methods significantly. To facilitate further research, we have made the source code for the Layered decomposition of LA-MAPF publicly available<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>."

Based on the relative position and velocity between unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), a control barrier function for heterogeneous systems is specifically designed, which directly incorporates the dynamic characteristics of different UGVs to ensure collision avoidance. Meanwhile, an independent control Lyapunov function is constructed for each heterogeneous UGV to exponentially track a predetermined trajectory. To minimize control cost, a decentralized quadratic programming is proposed such that each UGV’s optimal control input can be computed in real time and online. Compared with existing centralized method, our method is a decentralized one which significantly reduces the computational complexity because it enables each UGV to make independent decisions using only local information. The results can be easily applied to obstacle avoidance of static obstacles. Both simulations and experiments verify that the proposed method can effectively achieve the safety and trajectory tracking of the HMUGVS."

    "abstract": "The reliability of consumer Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AISs) increasingly relies on decentralized consensus protocols. However, the economic incentives underpinning them are vulnerable. While existing attacks already exploit these weaknesses for profit, this paper reveals a more precarious threat landscape. We introduce Power Adjusting Withholding with Bribe Money (BM-PAW), a novel strategy where an attacker forges an incentive-compatible coalition with a third party through algorithmic bribery. We demonstrate through formal analysis and large-scale simulations that BM-PAWyields superior rewards for both the attacker and the bribed pool compared to state-of-the-art attacks. Crucially, our game-theoretic analysis shows that BM-PAW transforms the classic “miner’s dilemma.” Instead of a strategic stalemate, the game’s equilibrium collapses into a decisive conflict predominantly determined by relative hash power. This finding uncovers a critical economic vulnerability that threatens the consensus layer of consumer AISs and challenges the long-held assumption of strategic deterrence in mining ecosystems. We conclude by proposing practical countermeasures to mitigate this new class of threat."

    "abstract": "In local flexibility markets (LFMs), distribution system operators (DSOs) can obtain flexibility from distributed energy resource aggregators (DERAs) to address operation problems of distribution systems (DSs). However, in a single LFM, the supply and demand of flexibility may not be balanced, leading DSOs to face significant economic challenges. In this paper, leveraging the geographically coupled flexibility (GCF) provided by geographically dispersed data centers (DCs), a coordinated operation framework for multi-LFMs is proposed. This framework enables wireless connections between multi-LFMs without geographical limitations, only requiring interactions between DSOs and their local DC. To clear the multi-LFMs, an optimization model is established with the objective of minimizing total operation costs of multi-LFMs. The optimization model is solved by ADMM to protect the data privacy. A settlement method for GCF is proposed to allocate the total cost fairly. Furthermore, the uncertain parameters are addressed using distributionally robust chance constraints based on Wasserstein metric. Three DCs, which are connected to three DSs adapted from IEEE 15-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus DSs, respectively, are used in case studies. The results demonstrate that the GCF enables effective integration and utilization of DERAs’ flexibility across the three LFMs, facilitating the balance between flexibility supply and demand."

    "abstract": "Non-profit organizations find themselves in what researchers have termed a \"cyber-poor, target-rich\" environment – they handle increasingly sensitive donor and beneficiary data yet chronically underinvest in cybersecurity due to resource constraints. Recent evidence from the UK suggests that nearly one third of charities encountered cyber incidents in 2024. At the global level, close to two thirds of nonprofits continue to operate without documented incidentresponse policies. This combination of high exposure and limited preparedness places the sector in a distinctly vulnerable position. The study investigates whether cybersecurity audits— long associated with enterprise risk management and government oversight—can be adapted into practical resilience instruments for non-profits that typically lack comparable resources. Our approach draws on established frameworks, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO/IEC 27001 and 27005, the CIS Controls, and the IASME Cyber Assurance standard. From these sources we developed a methodology grounded in the principle of intelligent minimalism: a focus on a small set of high-impact controls that organizations are capable of sustaining rather than extensive checklists that often remain aspirational. Feasibility was examined through a sixmonth case study with the Bulgarian NGO Association for Democratic Education \"FAR\", complemented by two comparative analyses. Early findings suggest that streamlined audit practices can raise awareness, introduce structured processes, and improve resilience without overwhelming organizational capacity. While the evidence remains preliminary, the results point to the potential of tailored audits as a pragmatic means of strengthening non-profit cybersecurity, meriting further validation across more diverse contexts."

    "abstract": "The textile industry faces continuous challenges in reducing defects during manufacturing, as quality inconsistencies can lead to financial losses, reduced efficiency, and diminished consumer confidence. Addressing this issue requires a combination of methodological and technological approaches that optimize production while minimizing waste. This review examines various strategies for defect reduction, focusing on process improvement methodologies, predictive technologies, and sustainable practices. A systematic analysis of 12 studies highlights the effectiveness of structured quality management approaches in identifying and eliminating defect sources. Additionally, predictive models based on artificial intelligence have demonstrated significant potential in real-time defect detection and prevention, improving overall product quality. However, challenges such as machinery rigidity and the high variability of textile products complicate the implementation of these strategies. Sustainable manufacturing practices and specialized workforce training have also been identified as key factors in enhancing defect management, as they contribute to resource conservation, waste reduction, and improved working conditions. The findings suggest that a comprehensive approach, integrating advanced process optimization techniques, predictive analytics, and sustainable production methods, is essential for improving efficiency and quality in textile manufacturing. This integration not only reduces defects but also strengthens competitiveness in an industry increasingly driven by quality, sustainability, and technological innovation.

However, in Ecuador’s Zone 1, most MSMEs face persistent challenges in transforming digital presence into sales and operational efficiency. This study investigates digital adoption patterns and commercial outcomes among MSMEs in this region. A structured survey of $\\mathbf{3 7 7}$ MSMEs across six cities was conducted using stratified sampling. The dataset was analyzed through descriptive statistics, Chi-square testing, and segmentation analysis. The objective was to evaluate how internet-based tools-such as social media platforms, CRM systems, and e-commerce applications-translate into perceived competitiveness and measurable digital sales. The results revealed a $71.6 \\%$ adoption rate of digital tools, yet only $11.1 \\%$ of businesses reported generating more than $25 \\%$ of their sales via digital channels. Moreover, over $60 \\%$ of firms had invested less than ${\\$}$100 in such tools. Despite limited investment, 95.6% of adopters reported improvements in competitiveness. This work contributes to the development of digital maturity models for MSMEs and supports targeted policy and training programs. By identifying the technological and strategic barriers that hinder monetization, the study enables more effective interventions in digital capacity building, platform integration, and commercial scalability."

This study proposes an automated cloud sizing system that leverages historical workload analysis and integrates multiple forecasting strategies, including LSTM, ARIMA, Prophet, and a lightweight rule-based approach. The system evaluates average, maximum, and trend values of CPU, memory, and DTU usage against predefined thresholds to generate proactive pre-runtime recommendations. A prototype was implemented using the Flask framework, integrated with Azure Monitor and Azure Automation for automatic execution of plan adjustments. The experiments demonstrate that the rulebased method achieved the lowest error for CPU prediction (Test RMSE $=3.96$), while LSTM performed best for memory usage forecasting (Test RMSE $=4.97$). For Azure SQL (DTU), LSTM achieved the lowest error among the compared models. Compared to the baseline configuration, the system reduced costs by $14.25 \\%$, maintained resource efficiency, and recommended SKU adjustments that balanced cost savings with workload stability. The contribution of this study is a proactive and interpretable cloud sizing framework for PaaS that integrates multiple forecasting models with automation, and is validated through comparative experiments across rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches."

By capturing browser actions and contextual metadata, AgentPbD automatically infers user goals and intentions, transforming user demonstrations into an editable, modular LLM agent workflow, and displays it on the browser extension interface. Users can further review and modify the workflow through visual programming.

The integration of chaotic systems introduces a novel paradigm grounded in deterministic yet unpredictable dynamics. This paper presents a hybrid symmetric encryption scheme that combines Lorenz attractor as a chaotic key generator, ElGamal algorithm for symmetric operations, and BASE-85 encoding for efficient character-level data transport. The proposed algorithm, named “Joe Cipher”, leverages the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent in chaotic systems to generate high-entropy pseudo-random sequences, enhancing cryptographic strength. In practical environments, the main limitations are the high computational cost required to solve the system during the encryption and decryption processes, as well as the increase in ciphertext length relative to the input size. Experimental results show that Joe Cipher Experimental a Shannon entropy of 5.49 which is close to the theoretical maximum Base-85 alphabet; a strong relation between execution time and input length and exhibits high computational cost with CPU usage approaching 99% during decryption."

This paper analyzes WDM usage to allow high density channel assignation improving fiber optics media usage for WAN communications, including the analysis of how transmission variables, such as traffic speed and channel-to-channel spacing, affect the quality of the transmitted data. It was performed a comparison of different wavelength-allocation scenarios, leading to state the best data transmission setups that support actual and potentially future high-bandwidth demands throughout long distance optical networks, optimizing physical media usage and keeping a low bit error rate in the data transmission. Results show that it is possible to transmit at high bit rates in WDM optical fiber systems with a simple intensity modulation technique, up to the limit when the increase of bitrate causes a significant overlapping in the channels’ spectrum. For a $10 \\mathrm{~Gb} / \\mathrm{s}$ perchannel WDM system, when the inter-channel spacing is 100 GHz, the penalty of increasing from 5 to 25 channels is negligible but for a 50 GHz and 25 GHz separation, the penalty increases to 0.25 dB and 2 dB.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the cross-layer resilient control problem of networked switched systems under DoS attacks. In the cyber layer, considering the sequential decision-making process and incomplete information, a Bayesian Stackelberg game based on information entropy is utilized to model the interaction between two players, where the defender is the leader while the attacker acts as the follower. On this basis, the existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium are rigorously proven, and an algorithm is proposed to identify this equilibrium. The energy allocations of both players based on the equilibrium determines the data transmission delay of the physical layer. To deal with the impact of DoS-induced time delays, the state augmentation approach is employed to reformulate the original system into a delay-free form. An adaptive dynamic programming approach incorporating the mixed switching law is proposed to ensure both the stability and optimal performance. Then a weight related to the optimized performance is incorporated into the defender's cost function to bridge physical and cyber layers. Finally, an industrial simulation is conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Graph-based recommendation systems have excelled in modeling user–item interactions, but most focus solely on positive feedback, overlooking the critical role of negative feedback in capturing comprehensive user preferences. Signed graphs, which incorporate both positive and negative interactions, offer a promising approach but face challenges due to the oversimplification of balance theory and the limitations of conventional graph neural networks (GNNs) in processing negative signals. To address these issues, we propose paired channel enhanced sign-aware graph recommendation (PCSRec), a novel framework that holistically integrates positive and negative feedback. PCSRec introduces a path-enhanced embedding module that leverages a learnable path-encoding matrix to capture indirect structural patterns, overcoming the limitations of balance theory. Additionally, it employs a paired channel filtering mechanism with spectral low-pass and high-pass filters to model similarity from positive feedback and dissimilarity from negative feedback, respectively. A dual-loss optimization strategy, combining contrastive and Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) losses, further refines discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that PCSRec outperforms both unsigned and signed graph-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art recommendation performance. Ablation studies and visualizations confirm the effectiveness of its components in improving embedding quality and recommendation accuracy."

The WOT is naturally divided into two operating modes: maximum torque per ampere at low speed and flux weakening at high speed. Then, by constructing the correlation between the key radial electromagnetic force harmonics and the d-axis demagnetization current, it was clarified that the dominant vibration sources of the two operating modes are the electromagnetic force carrier harmonics force and (0,6<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f<sub>e</sub></i>), (0,12<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f<sub>e</sub></i>) electromagnetic force harmonics, respectively. For an extensive investigation, a 48-slot, 8-pole PMBL motor is chosen as a research example. Then, the vibration suppression methods of key harmonics reduction and carrier harmonics energy shifting are proposed. Next, the performances of the optimal PMBL motors are simulated to validate the proposed methodology. Finally, a prototype is fabricated and experimented. Both simulated and test results are presented to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis and design methodology."

    "abstract": "As software systems increase in scale and complexity, architectural decisions must be transparent, traceable, and understandable to diverse stakeholders. However, traditional documentation approaches—such as standard Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)—often lack the structured rationale and contextual detail necessary to support informed analysis and long-term architectural stewardship. This paper presents the Software Architecture Explainability Framework (SAEF), a structured approach for enabling explainable architectural decision-making. Central to the framework is the Explainable Architectural Decision Record (ADR-E), which extends traditional ADRs with explicit rationale, structured stakeholder-oriented explanations, rejected alternatives, and traceability links grounded in explainability principles inspired by AI. SAEF was evaluated through two industrial case studies: the selection of Azure Kubernetes Service for container orchestration and the adoption of an enterprise-grade observability platform. Using a mixed-methods design combining workshops, scenario-based simulations, surveys, interviews, and operational metrics, the study found that ADR-E substantially improved transparency, traceability, and stakeholder alignment. Both cases reported a 30% reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR) and transparency scores above 4.6/5. Overall, SAEF provides a practical and theoretically grounded foundation for explainable architectural decision-making. Future work will focus on tool support, graphical notations, and longitudinal assessments to enhance adoption and scalability."

These computational differences significantly affect real-time summarization performance. A probability-driven thresholding mechanism was introduced to optimize object detection, effectively reducing false positives and enhancing classification accuracy. Among the models, GoogLeNet achieved the best trade-off between accuracy (98.96%) and computational efficiency, while AlexNet attained the highest detection accuracy (99.12%) but exhibited a higher false detection rate (5.6%). SqueezeNet, though lightweight and resource-efficient, reached an accuracy of 94.26% but faced limitations in fine-grained recognition tasks. Probability versus correct detection analysis indicated that a threshold of 0.7 maximized accuracy while reducing misclassifications. The proposed adaptive thresholding framework demonstrates strong applicability in real-world scenarios such as wildlife monitoring, intelligent surveillance, and IoT-enabled video analytics. By bridging CNN-based architectures with scalable IoT-driven solutions, this research advances the development of robust, accurate, and efficient video summarization systems for next-generation intelligent environments."

    "abstract": "Mobile app usage data reveal user behavioral characteristics and is crucial for mobile operators for network service optimization, but its data collection is pricey and presents privacy concerns. Data synthesis, fortunately, can tackle this barrier by generating diverse and representative artificial datasets that resemble real-world data. In this paper, we propose SMAUG, a diffusion model-based generative model with large language models (LLMs) designed to generate personalized app usage data based on mobile users' mobility trajectories. To address the data inaccuracy issue brought by the sparsity nature of mobile app usage behavior, SMAUG decomposes the generation process and adopts a hierarchical structure framework to gradually refine the generation from the session level to the specific app level. By encoding spatio-temporal context and applying an attention mechanism, SMAUG effectively represents personalized user representations. Moreover, aiming to extensively explore the semantic information in app usage sessions, SMAUG incorporates LLMs to gain deeper insight into user behavior characteristics revealed in sessions, and also exploits a curriculum representation learning approach based on contrastive learning, exploring session characteristics from elementary to profound. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that SMAUG outperforms existing generative baseline approaches by over 25% under the metrics of RMSE, MAE, CRPS, JSD, M-TV, and Spearmanr. The model has also been successfully deployed to assist network service simulation, demonstrating their suitability for downstream tasks in real-world systems."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for privacy-preserving machine learning. FL enables distributed data owners (clients) to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data with a central server. However, FL is inherently vulnerable to free-rider and poisoning attacks, where free riders dissimulate their participation of training by sending counterfeit yet harmless model updates to the central server, while adversarial clients send poisonous model updates to the server to degrade the global model performance. Their distinctive attacking patterns make the simultaneous defense against both attacks very challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model-agnostic Shapley value-based robust and fair federated learning method (SVRFL), which models FL as a cooperative game and leverages Shapley values of model updates to defend against free riders and adversarial clients. Specifically, a client reputation score and a model utility score are computed using the Shapley value. Based on these scores, we ensure the basic fairness within FL by identifying and eliminating free riders, and realize adversarial robustness through discarding poisonous model updates, with theoretical convergence guaranteed. Extensive experiments show that SVRFL can detect typical free-rider attacks with up to full precision and is resistant to poisoning attacks launched by adversarial clients."

    "abstract": "Robotic automation in high-mix, low-volume settings often relies on structured workcells where fixtures, workpieces, and procedures are well defined, but tasks must be reconfigured quickly across variants. This paper presents the Design and Learning Research Group's solution to the euROBIN Manipulation Skill Versatility Challenge (MSVC) at IROS 2024, in which a standardized electronic task board is operated through a fixed sequence of subtasks. We deliberately adopt a simple, industry-style implementation: each subtask is taught by recording an open-loop Tool Center Point (TCP) and gripper trajectory in the task-board frame, a wrist-mounted depth camera is used once per run to localize the board and a few key features, and a web dashboard exposes the resulting motion primitives as reusable code blocks that can be reordered and reparameterized. With this pipeline, our system completes the benchmark in 28.2 s in the lab (37.2 s on-site), compared to a human baseline of 16.3 s and an average of 83.5 s for previous teams, closing a large part of the performance gap without advanced learning or feedback control. We further demonstrate limited skill transfer by retargeting the same subtask library to a smoke-detector battery replacement scenario required by the competition. Finally, we release our implementation as open source and discuss how competition design and benchmark structure influence the balance between simple engineered solutions and richer sensing and learning."

The metasurface comprises dual-linear-polarization, multilayer unit cells (UCs) with 3-bit phase resolution, exhibiting high transmission amplitude and a wide range of transmission phase shifts. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a Fermi feed and two metasurface prototypes were fabricated using printed circuit board (PCB) technology for measurement. The measured results show good agreement with simulations, demonstrating that the proposed design method can not only achieve dynamic switching between OAM beams and focusing beams but also enable dynamic switching between OAM beams with different topological charges. The demonstrated metasurface holds potential for application in intelligent dynamic scenarios such as autonomous vehicles and drone swarms."

    "abstract": "Indoor localization using ultra- wideband (UWB) technology has received much attention due to its ability to provide decimeter accuracy and low-cost/low-power implementation. However, challenges such as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation caused by ubiquitous obstacles, and systematic bias in off-the-shelf/low-cost UWB modules severely impair the accuracy of UWB measurements, resulting in reduced positioning accuracy and reliability. This paper develops a learning-enhanced robust adaptive fading extended/error-state Kalman filter (LRAF-E(S)KF) algorithm for UWB-based localization systems in complex indoor environments. Firstly, mismatches in the state and measurement noise covariance matrices, commonly found in conventional EKF, are adaptively mitigated by fading factors estimated from a linear KF. This improves positioning accuracy in dynamic environments without any excessive tuning. Then, a robust NLOS detector based on robust statistics is proposed to identify and suppress NLOS-contaminated UWB measurements. Finally, an extreme learning machine (ELM-) based network is developed for correcting large estimation errors in the vertical direction caused by systematic bias in UWB measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using two real-world datasets collected in real-time in indoor environments. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves positioning accuracy over the original E(S)KF algorithm and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under both “Only UWB” and “inertial measurement unit (IMU)-UWB” settings."

    "abstract": "Based on the linear high-order coupling topology, a direct synthesis and optimization technique (DS-OT) has been proposed to generate prototype functions tailored to the design specifications of multiband filters. This method can rapidly extract the coupling matrix of multiband filters, which can exhibit either equal-ripple response within the passbands, equal bandwidth response, or both simultaneously. Building on this, a method for extracting dual-band bandpass filter prototype functions with equal-ripple transmission functions between two subpassbands based on an iterative optimization approach is proposed. In addition, a dual-band filter (DBF) topology of a parallel resonator based on a single-cascaded quadruplet (PBCQ) is proposed. This structure features structural symmetry, a simple design, and the ability to achieve equal-ripple reflection functions within the subpassbands and equal-ripple transmission functions between the two subpassbands. Furthermore, it can be extended for use in multiband filter design. Fully leveraging the advantage of low insertion loss (IL) in high-order coupled filter design using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) materials, a 12th-order HTS DBF was designed and fabricated based on the aforementioned theory and topology. The filter function response exhibits three pairs of symmetric real transmission zeros (TZs), achieving equal-ripple responses both within the subpassbands and between them. Overall, the measured frequency response characteristics demonstrate excellent passband and stopband performance, closely aligning with the results obtained from full-wave analysis and theoretical analysis."

    "abstract": "A promising strategy to authenticate users’ identity in next generation wireless systems is by physical layer authentication (PLA) techniques. One way to accomplish authentication at the physical layer relies on comparison of the currently estimated instantaneous channel features, such as amplitude or frequency response, and those obtained during training: a hypothesis testing is applied whose optimal results are subject to the choice of the threshold value used in the comparison. By initiating pilot contamination attack (PCA) against the process of channel estimation, a non-authenticated user can corrupt the channel state information-based PLA mechanism. This way, identification fails and the intruder improves its substitution and impersonation capabilities. To secure the system against such types of malicious intervention, the methods to detect and counteract pilot contamination against PLA must be extensively studied. In this paper, an overview of several most significant methods related to PCA detection is presented together with an analysis of their characteristics."

Integrating embodiment offers a promising solution by making AI a more engaging and context-aware programming partner. To explore how embodied AI agent supports programming learning and affects user experiences, we designed a virtual reality (VR) programming environment with Wizard-of-Oz-controlled AI agents. Our study collected data from 18 participants through knowledge acquisition assessments and interviews. The results showed that embodiment improved engagement, enhanced communication efficiency, and offered emotional support. Specifically, the incorporation of embodied actions allows users to perceive the AI agent as a “programming partner” and introduces many interactions that resemble those shared with real-life partners. However, the effectiveness of embodied actions in supporting users with programming tasks depends on the timing and accuracy of those actions. This study reveals the potential of embodied AI agents in advancing programming education and provides valuable design insights for creating more intuitive and supportive AI programming partners."

In response, the widespread use of electric generators increased considerably, raising concerns about their environmental and health impacts. This study presents a novel methodology to estimate pollutant emissions (specifically CO2, $\\mathrm{CO}, \\mathrm{HC}$, and $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$) based solely on environmental noise levels. A stratified sample of 248 generators was measured across different urban zones using a sound level meter and a gas analyzer, following Ecuadorian regulations. Three machine learning models (linear regression, decision tree, and neural network) were trained to predict emissions from noise data. The decision tree model showed the best predictive capacity, with a maximum $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ of $\\mathbf{0. 6 6}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}_{\\mathbf{2}}$, a value that, while moderate, is considered acceptable in environmental estimation involving a single predictor variable. The trained model was then applied to a broader dataset of 710 generators to estimate total emissions during 691 hours of power outages recorded over 89 days. The results revealed the emission of 428 tons of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}, 14.91$ tons of $\\mathrm{CO}, 0.72$ tons of HC, and 7.6 tons of $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. In parallel, noise levels exceeded local regulatory limits, particularly in central and residential areas, indicating significant public health implications. The study supports the implementation of regulatory strategies, improvements in generator technology, and a shift towards cleaner energy sources in emergency contexts."

The first model, based on the structure proposed by the manufacturer, fails to accurately reproduce the terminal voltage evolution, even after numerical parameter adjustment, revealing its limitation in representing the actual behavior of the aged bank. The second model, based on Zubieta’s proposal, incorporates the nonlinear dependence of capacitance on voltage and was obtained through simulation in Simulink using the output of the manufacturer’s model as a reference. However, it also required numerical tuning, which yielded significantly different parameters consistent with an advanced aging state of the device. The results suggest a loss of conduction capability, a reduction in total capacitance, an increase in leakage resistance, and a slower dynamic response, considering that the bank is approaching the end of its useful life."

Objective: To validate the usability and perceived educational value of the Cayapas Telemedicine Platform through its implementation with rotating medical and nursing interns. Methods: A sequential mixed-methods study was conducted with 26 participants (23 medical and nursing interns and 3 tutors). Semi-structured interviews explored user needs and satisfaction, while quantitative data were collected using two instruments: the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a communication assessment scale. Results: The platform’s usability was rated as “marginal” (mean SUS score: $61.1 \\pm 13.8$). According to the communication scale, 56% of users agreed or strongly agreed that the tool improved interaction between students and tutors. Qualitative findings highlighted needs related to functionality, accessibility, interface design, and technical support. Participants suggested improvements in response times, notification systems, artificial intelligence integration, profession-specific profiles, and digital health training. Conclusions: Although the Cayapas platform shows potential as a support tool for rural clinical training, improvements in its usability and relevance are needed to facilitate its future implementation in rural contexts."

Given that several variables involved in the LCOE calculation are subject to uncertainty, the traditional ceteris paribus assumption is replaced with a Monte Carlo-based approach, introducing randomness into the input variables not included as objective functions in the optimization problem. This allows the generation of multiple Pareto fronts that capture the sensitivity of the LCOE to such uncertainties. To enhance computational efficiency throughout the iterative process, parallel processing is employed. The results are further enriched through contour mapping, which complements the analysis and facilitates visual interpretation. The methodology is validated through case studies, demonstrating its capability to explore a broad solution space, reduce risk exposure, and support more robust decision-making in energy planning under uncertainty."

    "abstract": "This study discusses the development of a building material product recommendation system based on ContentBased Filtering (CBF) by comparing two text representation approaches IndoBERT and Word2Vec. Data was collected through web scraping from the Mitra10 marketplace website, including product name, description, price, and physical dimensions. After preprocessing, the data were classified based on material categories. Each product description was then converted into a vector representation using the IndoBERT and Word2Vec models. Cosine similarity was used to measure the similarity between products and generate relevant recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by product category using Precision@10, Recall@10, and F1-Score@10 metrics. The results show that the IndoBERT model outperformed Word2Vec, achieving an F1-Score of 0.914 compared to 0.532. The system was then integrated into a web interface using Streamlit, which not only provides product recommendations but also calculates material requirements and cost estimates based on the user’s house size. This study demonstrates that transformer-based semantic representations can significantly enhance the quality of recommendation systems in the context of building materials."

    "abstract": "Global food security continues to be threatened by crop diseases that cause annual losses of over USD 220 billion. Image-based recognition of plant diseases has been studied extensively, but many existing works rely on single-species datasets, which limit the ability of models to generalize to more varied field conditions. In this study, we combine two publicly available Bangladeshi leaf image collections into a dataset of more than 15,000 images covering five crop species and eight disease categories. Using this dataset, we fine-tune and compare five pre-trained convolutional neural networks under identical conditions: VGG16, EfficientNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, and InceptionV3. VGG16 produces the most consistent results, with $99.29 \\%$ accuracy, $99.31 \\%$ precision, $99.29 \\%$ recall, and a $99.29 \\%$ F1-score. While improvements over prior results are modest, the study contributes a more diverse benchmark and a systematic comparison of commonly used architectures, which may help guide the development of practical tools for plant disease detection."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly changed customer interactions in e-commerce, particularly through the use of chatbots. These tools enhance the user experience by providing quick responses and handling customer service effectively. This study analyzes the factors that influence Indonesian users’ behavioral intentions toward chatbots by expanding the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to include personal motivation as an intermediary variable. An online survey was used to collect data from 160 e-commerce users, and analysis was conducted using a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. Results show that perceived usefulness has a significant impact on personal motivation, which in turn influences behavioral intention. Additionally, perceived ease of use has a significant impact and shapes user attitudes, which in turn influence behavioral intention. These findings highlight the importance of creating useful and user-friendly chatbots while also encouraging user motivation and positive attitudes. This study makes a significant contribution by addressing the limitations of previous studies related to chatbot adoption in emerging markets, while also providing practical insights for strengthening customer service strategies in Indonesian e-commerce."

    "abstract": "This article presents a hierarchical voltage control framework based on multitimescale model predictive control (MPC) for ADNs, with high penetration of photovoltaic systems and electric vehicles. The proposed scheme utilizes a hybrid control architecture, wherein OLTC is controlled at the first stage using MPC, leveraging sparse measurement and communication-based centralized control scheme. Inverter-driven control devices (IDCDs) are operated on a faster timescale, utilizing MPC-based distributed coordination. To enhance operational efficiency, a community detection algorithm based on network modularity is utilized for network clustering. A modified modularity metric incorporating the diameter of the cluster, in addition to the average voltage sensitivity and device regulation capacity, is utilized for improved network partitioning. A decomposition coordination control model is used for distributed control of IDCDs, utilizing the alternating-direction method of multipliers, with reduced communication overhead. The scalability and coordination capability of the presented model are validated on the 33-bus network and the IEEE 123-bus network."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy (LAE), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become essential for efficient wireless power transfer (WPT) and data collection due to their flexible deployment. In time-sensitive LAE scenarios, maintaining data freshness is critical yet highly challenging, which highlights the age of information (AoI) as a key performance metric. Single-UAV systems suffer from limited endurance and inefficient scheduling, while existing multi-UAV frameworks often neglect the heterogeneous energy demands of ground devices (GDs) and the tight coupling among scheduling, power control, bandwidth allocation, and trajectory planning. These limitations lead to inefficient resource utilization and suboptimal AoI performance in large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative multi-UAV framework aiming at minimizing the average AoI. Specifically, we introduce a structured joint optimization scheme termed <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TRUT</i>, comprising three stages: (i) Task location (TL) clustering and GD association via elbow-rule K-means, (ii) Resource scheduling using a genetic algorithm (GA) integrated with closed-form bandwidth allocation, and (iii) UAV trajectory optimization using an improved butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA). Simulation results confirm that our proposed <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TRUT</i> significantly reduces the average AoI compared to benchmark schemes."

    "abstract": "An improved active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy based on a differential compensation extended state observer (DC-ESO) is proposed to suppress speed ripple of permanent magnet hub motor (PMHM) under complex operating conditions. Based on the traditional extended state observer (ESO), the improved method differentiates the proportional correction term of the estimated speed and then compensates it into the correction term of the total estimated speed disturbance. The differential term can quickly adjust the estimated total perturbation at the initial stage of the perturbation change by feeding back the rate of change of the velocity error, realizing the composite correction of the estimated total perturbation by the proportional term and the differential term. Meanwhile, the corrected estimated total perturbation is fed forward to the control law, which realizes the decoupling of the system speed tracking performance and the anti-disturbance performance, and thus reduces the difficulty of parameter tuning. The method can realize accurate disturbance estimation and compensation without modifying the observer bandwidth, thus improving the speed stability of PMHM drive system. The theoretical analysis and experimental results verify the effectiveness of DC-ESO in terms of disturbance estimation accuracy and anti-disturbance performance."

    "abstract": "Room temperature vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber is widely used for outdoor high voltage insulation due to its strong hydrophobicity and anti-pollution performance, but its inherent flammability limits use for fire prone environments. This study investigates novel RTV silicone rubber composites incorporating La₂O₃, a rare earth oxide, to enhance flame retardancy via radical scavenging and char formation. Four formulations are prepared: undoped silicone rubber, silicone rubber doped with 1 wt.% and 5 wt.% nano La₂O₃, and a commercially used 45 wt.% micro ATH filled rubber. UL-94 testing shows that the 1 wt.% La₂O₃ composite achieved a V-0 rating, outperforming all other specimens, including the ATH composite, which attained V-1. Thermo-oxidative treatment and FTIR analysis reveal fewer surface microcracks in the 1 wt.% La₂O₃ sample, with minimal degradation of Si-(CH₃)₂ and Si–O–Si bonds, indicating reduced bond scission and effective radical suppression. TGA confirms enhanced thermal stability, with delayed T5%, higher thermal resistance index, and increased char yield. IPT further verified improvements, as the 1 wt.% La₂O₃ composite exhibited the shortest tracking length, surpassing the ATH based and other test specimens. Breakdown strength, volume resistivity and Shore hardness measurements demonstrate that the 1 wt.% La₂O₃ composite offers the best dielectric performance with suitable hardness, while ATH composite provides moderate improvement over the undoped specimen. Overall, the 1 wt.% La₂O₃ filled RTV composite demonstrates superior flame resistance, dielectric reliability, tracking resistance, and mechanical stability with retained flexibility, making it a promising material for high voltage outdoor insulation under wildfire prone conditions."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations in global communications, navigation, and remote sensing has significantly increased the demand for efficient inter-satellite link (ISL) solutions. However, traditional methods face numerous challenges due to the complexity of topological structures and the ambiguity of link formation rules, often relying on empirical experience for design. To address these issues, this paper proposes an inter-satellite link design methodology grounded in topological principles. By introducing concepts such as covering spaces, group actions, and generators, a unified link description framework is established, transforming the time-varying physical topology into a stationary logical one, applicable to homogeneous constellation topologies. Based on this framework, a generator-based design approach is developed, where binary decision variables define link states to enable configuration and optimization of ISL topologies. Simulation results show that this method enables further optimization of classical designs and supports the construction of advanced connectivity schemes. The proposed strategy provides a systematic perspective for scalable topological link design in LEO satellite networks."

The model synthesizes private genomic profiles with research repositories such as PubMed and the NIH Genome Database, ensuring that insights are both individualized and grounded in current medical evidence. A dual-enclave architecture separates private DNA information from public research inputs, while large language models (LLMs) serve as verification agents to cross-check outcomes against peer-reviewed literature. Key genetic markers, including MTHFR, COMT, MTR, and AHCY, are analyzed to provide recommendations on supplementation, stress management, and lifestyle modifications. By employing a zeroknowledge design and encrypted processing, sensitive data remains protected while benefiting from continuous recalibration against emerging evidence. Unlike existing frameworks that remain descriptive or limited to static recommendations, the proposed system enables dynamic, realtime updates that adapt to evolving genomic and clinical knowledge. This approach advances personalized medicine by offering actionable, evidence-based interventions while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of individual health records."

These unstructured comments are valuable for evaluating service quality but are challenging to classify manually. This study proposes a Weighted Soft Voting approach that combines Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest for sentiment classification. User comments collected on August 1, 2025, were preprocessed using tokenization, TF-IDF, and Chi-Square feature selection, and experiments were conducted on datasets of varying sizes: SIKD (hundreds of comments), SIKSMA (thousands of comments), and SOS (Tens of thousands of comments). Results show that Logistic Regression achieved the best F1-score of 0.8571 on the medium dataset (SIKSMA), while simple models such as SVM and Logistic Regression were sufficient for the small dataset (SIKD). On the large and imbalanced SOS dataset, the proposed Weighted Soft Voting ensemble (WRFLRSVM RBF) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.8274 and accuracy of 0.8459, substantially outperforming individual classifiers. These findings demonstrate that ensemble methods are particularly effective for large-scale, imbalanced datasets and provide practical insights for enhancing sentiment analysis in social welfare."

This study focuses on the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for detecting rice plant health using aerial imagery captured by drones. The workflow involves two main stages: first, a Faster R-CNN model is used to detect and generate bounding boxes for each individual plant, which are then cropped into separate images. Second, a U-Net model is applied to segment the leaves, from which the average RGB values are extracted. These values are compared with the IRRI Leaf Color Chart (LCC) to classify the health status of each plant. The models were successfully trained according to the intended objectives, and the entire pipeline was implemented in Python to automate the processes of image loading, model inference, segmentation, color extraction, and classification. The Faster R-CNN achieved a detection recall of $\\sim 30 \\%$, while U-Net segmentation produced accurate masks with an average processing time of 1.24 seconds per image. This system demonstrates the potential to support precision agriculture, reduce farmers’ workloads, and sustainably increase productivity. Unlike prior works that address only single stages of rice plant monitoring, this study integrates detection, segmentation, and classification into a unified pipeline using a self-collected dataset, demonstrating a scalable approach for precision agriculture."

    "abstract": "Programmer interruptions are common and disruptive. While research has focused on understanding their nature, impact, and associated recovery cost, others have looked at visual reminders of recent development actions as recovery support mechanisms. Until now, however, these have only extended as far as the timeline of source code change alone. Thus, there are opportunities to improve this information in a codebase’s history to better support programmers’ interruption recovery. We conducted a within-subjects exploratory study investigating how developers use code history during interruption recovery. We compared a new sub-goal history interface, which contextually organized code changes and web activity into sub-goals, with an existing chronological timeline tool support identified in the literature. Our findings reveal that developers significantly leveraged the sub-goal history interface more frequently during post-interruption recovery, suggesting its potential to improve how developers navigate past work. While not leading to a significant reduction in overall recovery time in this study, sub-goal history provided valuable support for integrating external resources, facilitated faster initial re-engagement, and showed a generally better recovery success rate. We observed developers employing diverse, multimodal strategies, and, importantly, our results highlight recovery as a multi-stage process rather than a single event. These insights emphasize the crucial role of history-aware tool support for recovery workflows and underscore the need for designs that balance contextual detail with usability and adaptability to effectively support both developers’ passive (reading through information) and active (searching for information) engagement with the recovery tool support."

    "abstract": "Ecuador is currently experiencing a severe energy crisis caused by prolonged drought conditions associated with climate change and the El Niño phenomenon. With over $70 \\%$ of the country’s electricity generated from hydroelectric sources, the sustained reduction in reservoir inflows has significantly limited generation capacity. In response, authorities have implemented rolling blackouts and energy rationing to balance supply and demand. Among the affected infrastructure are large-scale hydroelectric plants, including one that contributes approximately $10 \\%$ of the nation’s total hydroelectric output. This context highlights the critical need for improved operational efficiency and advanced control strategies to ensure energy availability and resilience under hydrological stress. This paper presents the simulation-based design and evaluation of a Generalized Predictive Controller (GPC) applied to a hydroelectric turbine governor system. The study compares the dynamic performance of the GPC against a conventional PID controller under varying load conditions. Although both strategies yield similar results under nominal operation, the predictive approach offers enhanced efficiency and responsiveness. The discussion emphasizes the potential impact of adopting model-based control in scenarios of water scarcity, where predictive optimization of limited flow can support critical energy availability and improve system resilience."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and observational evaluation of a custom visual communication system for a nonverbal child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and spastic cerebral palsy. The system was structured in three levels of symbolic representation: colors, geometric shapes, and alphabetic markers. The intervention consisted of daily 10-minute sessions over a sevenweek period, embedded in the participant’s natural routines. Results indicate that the color-concept association was acquired by Week 3, geometric shape differentiation was consolidated and maintained through Week 6, and alphabetic markers, introduced from Week 3 to Week 7, were not assimilated. A complementary sensory storytelling activity, initiated in Week 5, showed progressive improvement in recognition rates ($60 \\%, 80 \\%$, and $90 \\%$ across three phases). The findings suggest that perceptually grounded, lowcomplexity symbolic systems can provide accessible communication alternatives for nonverbal individuals in low-resource settings. Limitations include the single-case design, the short intervention period, and the absence of quantitative validation. Future work should explore replication with larger samples, integration of digital supports, and connections with early literacy skills."

The modeling of these dependencies with eight mathematical models in the Matlab environment is done.

The analysis covers peer-reviewed articles, systematic reviews, and experimental studies conducted between 2019 and 2024, focusing on children aged 0 to 18 years. Findings reveal that color significantly influences attention, memory, emotional regulation, and social behavior, with age-specific effects: high-contrast and matte schemes support visual development in infants; bright warm tones stimulate creativity and interaction in preschoolers; cool and neutral palettes enhance concentration and reduce visual stress in primary school children; and personalized, adaptive color environments foster autonomy and motivation in adolescents. The review highlights the importance of integrating ergonomic principles in interior design, including color zoning, saturation control, and the use of natural light and materials. It also emphasizes the role of direct feedback from children, supplemented by parental interpretation in younger age groups, as a key methodological component in assessing environmental impact. The study concludes with practical recommendations for creating safe, stimulating, and developmentally responsive visual environments for children"

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, millions of people have been using LLM-based AI tools to aid in programming, data analysis, and software engineering tasks. These AI coding assistants range from specialized tools like GitHub Copilot to general-purpose chatbots like Claude. In parallel, academics have published dozens of papers on forward-looking prototypes to expand our collective thinking beyond present-day industry trends. However, despite rapid advances in both sectors in recent years, we still lack an understanding of how their designs relate to one another and what tradeoffs are commonly made. At this key moment in 2025 when design patterns are starting to emerge, it is important to zoom out to see the forest instead of the trees. To do so, we performed the first comprehensive design analysis of 90 LLM-based AI coding assistants. We categorized the feature sets of 58 industry products and 32 academic projects, then formulated a design space that captures key variations in their user experiences. Our design space covers $\\mathbf{1 0}$ dimensions related to UI modalities, system inputs, capabilities, and outputs. We use this design space to reveal trends in both industry and academic projects across three eras ranging from autocomplete to chat to agent-based interfaces. Lastly, to address the question of who the target users of these tools are, we present six user personas whose preferences lie in different regions of our design space: professional software engineers, HCI researchers and hobbyist programmers, UX designers, conversational programmers (e.g., product managers and marketers), data scientists, and students."

These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-Loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model’s output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDE, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study ($\\mathrm{N}=18$) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDE led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant."

    "abstract": "This article assesses the feasibility of air-cushion vehicles (ACVs) as a sustainable mode of transportation by analyzing their environmental impact, energy efficiency, and operational safety through a systematic review guided by the PRISMA methodology. The findings indicate that ACVs offer notable advantages over conventional transportation systems, particularly in remote or difficult-to-access areas, due to their minimal surface contact and capacity to carry heavy loads. While inherent instabilities—such as sideslip and Kelvin-Helmholtz os-cillations—are present, these can be effectively mitigated through advanced control mechanisms, including neural networks and predictive algorithms, thereby improving both safety and maneu-verability. From an environmental perspective, electric-powered models and aerodynamic enhancements have demonstrated energy savings of up to $20 \\%$, underscoring their potential to reduce emissions in comparison to traditional vessels. Furthermore, the reviewed case studies highlight the scalability and adaptability of these vehicles across various applications. The review concludes that ACVs constitute a viable and sustainable alternative for future logistics and transportation systems, provided that robust control systems and optimized designs are employed. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable mobility, aligning with the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."

The system addresses the limitations of traditional plant monitoring methods, which often lack precision, require high manual effort, and result in inefficient use of resources. The proposed solution integrates sensors to measure soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity, with collected data transmitted via LoRa to a centralized platform. Solar energy is employed to ensure autonomous, continuous operation in remote or off-grid locations.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a mobile-first extension to our modular Web GIS framework by integrating smartphone geolocation as a primary input for real-time place discovery and routing. Unlike our previous works, which focused on database-driven spatial content management, conversational routing via chatbot interfaces, and AI-assisted image geolocation through CLIP and EXIF metadata, the present research emphasizes direct acquisition of user location through the smartphone’s GPS and its enrichment with reverse-geocoded addresses. A Python-based microservice retrieves and validates live coordinates, optionally resolves them to semantic address information, and transmits the data to a Spring Boot–PostGIS backend. This integration enables users to initiate itineraries \"from here,\" dynamically discover nearest places within thematic groups, and receive geofenced notifications when entering predefined zones. Field evaluations demonstrate that smartphone-based geolocation reduces user input overhead, improves route relevance, and provides a robust fallback when image metadata is unavailable. Applications extend across tourism, participatory planning, and emergency response, where immediacy and personalization are critical. By bridging live mobile positioning with database-driven and AI-assisted GIS components, this paper contributes a novel, user-centric framework that advances the real-time and contextual capabilities of Web GIS platforms."

However, most biopolymers lack the mechanical rigidity required for conventional processing techniques, such as extrusion and injection molding.

The materials were processed using extrusion and injection molding and subsequently characterized in terms of their mechanical and morphological properties, in addition to undergoing biodegradation testing. The addition of apricot shell significantly modified the mechanical behavior, reducing the elastic modulus from 161.56 MPa to $\\mathbf{6 5. 7 4 ~ M P a}$ while improving the elongation at break from $\\mathbf{5 7. 2 3 \\%}$ to $\\mathbf{1 1 9. 2 0 \\%}$ and the impact strength from $\\mathbf{6. 2 5}$ to 15.90 $\\mathbf{k J} / \\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{2}}$. These results demonstrate a synergistic plasticizing effect between zein, diethylene glycol, and the oxygenated compounds from the apricot shell. FESEM micrographs confirmed strong interfacial adhesion and homogeneous particle distribution, supporting the synergistic plasticizing interaction among zein, DEG, and ASF components. The proposed formulations enable reliable processing of zein-based bioplastics using scalable methods, enhancing their viability for industrial applications such as packaging and consumer goods.

This study proposes an automated VSD detection system using the Faster R-CNN model on pediatric cardiac ultrasound videos from the parasternal long-axis view. The dataset consists of 11 videos (10 VSD, 1 normal), from which frames were extracted and divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The model was trained to identify the ‘VSD’ class against a normal background. We evaluated three CNN-based feature extractors: ResNet50, ResNet101, and Inception-ResNet V2, using Average Precision (AP) as the primary metric. The results show that Faster R-CNN with ResNet101 achieved the highest AP at an IoU threshold of 0.5 (AP0.5) with $75.8 \\%$, while ResNet50 demonstrated the best mean AP ($27.7 \\%$) across multiple IoU thresholds. Despite some false positives, the model effectively localized VSDs at $\\mathbf{7 - 8}$ frames per second.

We also describe the associated computational methods, based on interval intersections or an offline linear program (LP). Beyond certifying compatibility, we give conditions under which the quadratic-program (QP) safety filter is affine in the state. This enables explicit implementations via convex combinations of vertex-feasible inputs. Case studies illustrate the results."

    "abstract": "Near-shore communication plays a crucial role in maritime operations, serving as a last-mile link between ships and shore-based infrastructures. However, this environment poses several challenges. High vessel density, coastal obstructions, large ships, and mountainous terrain often block the communication paths. These factors significantly degrade the signal quality and reliability. In addition, sea-surface reflections, vessel motion, and Doppler effects create a complex propagation environment. This leads to composite fading channels that further complicate reliable communication. If left unaddressed, these challenges can compromise the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. To address these issues, we propose the use of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) to enhance last-mile maritime communication. The IRS can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic waves to optimize signal propagation. By intelligently tuning the phase shifts of the IRS elements, the system can strengthen signals, extend coverage, and reduce the effects of composite fading and Doppler shifts. Our results show that the proposed IRS-aided system outperforms conventional relay-based systems by up to 6 bps/Hz. Implementing IRS in near-shore communication networks thus promises more resilient, efficient, and reliable maritime communication."

Compared to conventional FDTD/TDPO hybrid approaches, the proposed method offers two main advantages, First, the HIE-FDTD algorithm, as a weakly conditionally stable implicit scheme, enables the use of significantly larger time steps by relaxing the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) constraint, and a sparse sample strategy combined with a sliding-window mechanism is employed in the near-to-far-field extrapolation process, to support long-time transient simulations. Second, that the method supports distributed parallelization across multiple processors, substantially reducing computational time. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The simulation results show good agreement with those obtained by traditional methods, and the parallel implementation consistently achieves approximately 80% efficiency across varying processor counts."

The reason for this dilemma in scalability and compatibility is that the standard isolation primitive on RISC-V, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Physical Memory Protection</i> (PMP), is not scalable.

    "abstract": "Accurate, automated analysis of multi-modal MRI is foundational to neuro-oncology informatics. However, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into clinical workflows is critically hampered by the “black box” nature of many deep learning models, which erodes clinical trust and complicates validation. This challenge is compounded by the difficulty of developing integrative approaches that can transparently and efficiently fuse heterogeneous information from multiple MRI sequences. To address this critical gap in Explainable AI (XAI) for healthcare, we propose TTG-U-Net, a novel segmentation framework designed to bridge performance with clinical interpretability and efficiency. Our framework provides an integrative solution through three synergistic components: (1) a cross-modal Transformer that explicitly models inter-modality dependencies, yielding attention maps that serve as a transparent visual audit trail for the model's reasoning, directly addressing the need for XAI; (2) a dynamic low-rank tensor decomposition that adaptively regularizes the model and reduces its computational footprint, facilitating deployment in standard hospital information systems; and (3) a modality-adaptive gating mechanism that learns a transparent information routing policy, mimicking established radiological principles. Validated on the BraTS 2021 benchmark, a single TTG-U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance (Dice: WT 91.7%, TC 88.8%, ET 84.5%), competitive with computationally-intensive ensembles. The dynamic low-rank design reduces the parameter count by approximately 41%, enhancing efficiency for practical deployment. Crucially, interpretability studies confirm the model's learned fusion strategy aligns with clinical knowledge, bolstering its trustworthiness. TTG-U-Net offers a compelling framework that moves beyond pure segmentation accuracy, providing a robust, efficient, and trustworthy tool poised for meaningful integration into clinical decision support systems and informatics workflows, demonstrating a viable path for responsible AI in healthcare decision-making."

    "abstract": "Closing resistors are critical components in ultra-high-voltage circuit breakers, however, their dynamic conduction under pulsed-energy injection remains poorly understood, thereby limiting energy-handling capability and compromising breaker reliability. This study combines pulsed-energy injection experiments and thermoelectrically coupled simulations to elucidate the electrothermal response and conductivity evolution of carbon-ceramic resistors. By correlating macroscopic resistance variations with microscopic conductive-chain dynamics, the conduction process is divided into four distinct stages: transient conduction, sustained decline, steady fluctuation, and gradual recovery. A thermoelectric-driven mechanism governing the conductive network is proposed. The microscale network consists of non-conductive, discontinuous, and continuous conductive chains, whose activation is jointly controlled by both the electric field and temperature. Strong electric fields induce tunneling conduction in discontinuous chains, whereas thermal expansion effectively reduces contact resistance in continuous chains. The individual and coupled influences of temperature and electric field are quantified by numerical fitting of the recovery resistance versus temperature and transient resistance versus field. Results reveal a pronounced thermoelectric synergy with clear energy dependence. Under low-energy injection, coupling enhances carrier excitation, yielding resistance reductions exceeding the sum of individual thermal and electrical contributions. Under high-energy injection, conductive-chain saturation suppresses further synergy, leading to smaller-than-additive resistance reductions."

    "abstract": "Objective: Tremor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are challenging to assess due to low resolution and subjectivity from standard clinical scales. To address this, wearable devices have been used, but algorithms have been relying on controlled or limited activity conditions. Our objective is to create a context-independent metric quantifying tremor in free-living conditions to bridge the gap between biomedical engineering and the PD field. Methods and procedures: We designed an algorithm which computes a tremor index (TI) from accelerometer data, collected via the Empatica E4 worn on the wrist by home dwelling people with PD. For validation, we use a within-participant design, comparing the TIs of the most and least tremor-affected hand. We included seven participants with unilateral tremor, monitored for two weeks each. The algorithm is able to compute TIs for a set of frequencies identified in literature as associated with different tremor types (3–12 Hz), over adjustable sampling time windows. Results: We show that the most tremor-affected hand yields a higher TI than the other hand for frequency sets that are individual to each person, in particular around 5-6 Hz where rest tremor typically occurs. We find that we can disambiguate tremor across 3-12 Hz from general movement and resting states. The number of frequencies with inter-hand separation correlate with the MDS-UPDRS part III tremor items. Conclusion: The designed tremor quantification algorithm can quantify tremor symptoms over time for people with PD and can be used to identify the individualized frequency ranges where these movements happen, in free-living conditions. Clinical and translational impact: By utilizing pervasive, easy-to-use wrist-wearable devices equipped with accelerometers, the proposed index has the potential to change how clinicians and researchers track tremor symptoms in the daily lives of patients."

    "abstract": "Cascaded parallel connection of the branches is a promising solution for high-power electric-motor-emulator (EME) converters. However, the switching loss will increase prominently due to increased parasitic output capacitance of the paralleled power devices, especially under light-load working points. A quadrilateral current mode (QCM)-based zero-voltage switching (ZVS) scheme for the cascaded-parallel topology is proposed to reduce the power loss of the emulator converter (EC). “H-bridge” inductors are configured across the two adjacent paralleled branches to form the desired quadrilateral current, and ZVS can be fully realized for all devices of the two branches. The ZVS process is analytically demonstrated in detail, with the mathematical model of the optimal inductance of the “H-bridge” inductor also developed by considering all key influences, e.g., deadtime, phase-shift time, and parasitic output capacitance. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed QCM-based parallel scheme, and the system loss of a prototype EC can be reduced up to 83% under light-load conditions. The proposed QCM-based parallel scheme and the developed ZVS mathematical model, along with the design recommendations and the application example on a prototyped motor emulator, provide both theoretical support and practical guidance for reducing the power loss of the commercial EC as a cost-effective solution."

    "abstract": "As the trend of the increasing implementation of electrical devices with high power densities and frequencies, the excess eddy current loss is taking a larger proportion of iron losses in magnetic cores of devices, like electrical transformers, in the power system. This article proposed a numerical method for calculating the dynamic losses of grain-oriented (GO) silicon steel sheets considering the movement of the magnetic domain wall generating the excess eddy currents. First, according to the domain wall theory, the GO silicon steel sheets are simulated by the finite element (FE) method with the moveable boundary conditions. Then, dynamic and static hysteresis loops are measured to extract the dynamic losses of the magnetic core sample. Compared to the measurement results, the proposed method has better accuracy than the conventional dynamic simulation method ignoring excess eddy currents. The distributions of eddy currents, including the classical eddy currents and the excess eddy currents, can be derived to investigate the effects of the domain wall movements on the magnetic characteristics. With the magnetic domain width being determined, the dynamic loss of GO silicon steels under different exciting frequencies and induction amplitudes can be predicted physically by FE analysis."

    "abstract": "Spectral super-resolution (SSR) aims to reconstruct hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB or multispectral images. Most existing SSR methods operate under the Close-World setting, where models are trained and evaluated within the same scene distribution. Although this yields high accuracy, such approaches struggle to generalize when deployed to unseen scenes. To address this gap, we move towards the Open-World setting and propose a decomposition-based framework, termed DecSSR, which explicitly enhances generalization across diverse scenes. Then, Frequency-aware Contrastive Learning in Orthogonal Space (FCO) is customized to narrow the amplitude consistency between different spaces while amplify the phase difference between different scenes, which urges DecSSR to simultaneously maintain inter-scene priors and share cross-scene spectral correlation. Next, a FRactional Fourier Transform guided Sparse Spectral-wise Transformer (FRFT-SST) is proposed to reconstruct the Null with learnable sparsity constraints and emphasized region distribution. To protect salient characteristics in Null, a Degradation-aware Null-space Purification Module is tailored to dynamically accommodate and counteract noise perturbations with degradation parameters. We evaluate our method on four benchmarks across both visual and remote sensing domains, showing superior reconstruction accuracy and improved robustness under distribution shifts compared with state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "This work presents a deep learning approach for short-term forecasting of active power in photovoltaic (PV) plants operating within islanded microgrids. Three forecasting schemes were implemented in Python using the Darts library: a baseline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE) model without covariates, and a TiDE variant with exogenous inputs (solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and reactive power). Models were trained on hourly data from a 952 kW PV system on Isabela Island (Ecuador) using 2022 records. The forecasting horizon was 28 days, produced as two consecutive 336 -hour windows (14 days each). Performance was assessed with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The TiDE model without covariates matched the LSTM baseline in MAE while reducing MSE by $\\mathbf{1 9. 4 \\%}$. Including covariates did not improve accuracy but substantially decreased the number of training epochs, indicating faster convergence. These findings demonstrate that TiDE achieves competitive accuracy with lower computational cost, thereby supporting more efficient dispatch strategies in islanded and resource-constrained microgrids."

The Renewable Fraction (RF) was the indicator used to measure grid dependence across the 17 simulated scenarios. Both systems were modeled, simulated, and optimized using Homer Pro software. Results show that the PV/Grid system with a 400 kWp PV achieved an RF of 63.8%, Net Present Cost (NPC) of USD 632,628, and Cost of Energy (COE) of USD $0.0854 / \\mathrm{kWh}$. Although four other scenarios achieved higher RF values, they involved greater electricity exports to the grid without any economic return for the building administration, following applicable local electrical regulations. Similarly, among the PV/Grid/FC scenarios, the system with a 600 kWp PV achieved an RF of 78.9%, NPC of USD 1,593,881.97, and COE of USD $0.238 / \\mathrm{kWh}$. Besides, results indicate that scenarios incorporating the PV/Grid/FC system exhibit lower grid dependence, as both imported and exported electricity are significantly reduced compared to PV/Grid scenarios with the same $\\mathbf{P V}$ array size. A significant cost gap was observed between the conventional PV/Grid scenarios and those incorporating FCs."

The parts are intended to be used in sealing systems for transportation purposes, especially on airports ensuring that suitcases have not been open by authorized or non-authorized third-parties. The products are tightened by the users themselves once they have packed their luggage. Each product has a unique serial number and once secured, it could not be opened without being destroyed. Shown in the paper is a drawing of the part in three dimensions. A key highlight and main challenge of this study is the part’s complexity. The part is long, elastic, and made of plastic, which leads to multiple quality issues such as bending and other defects typical for automatic feeding. This unstable and flexible shape of the parts is directly related to the way they are packed and stored, before loading to the system. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and production of two distinct system variants designed to overcome the identified quality challenges and to present productivity experiments on the final design. Polymer single components are generally causing more issues with part feeding. The realized systems are the main result, together with the productivity analysis and comparison. Among the methods for analysis is a popular methodology for assessment of the degree of suitability for automatic feeding of parts. Though too theoretical and a bit old-fashioned, it provides a good reference point for assessment of parts."

To address these inefficiencies, techniques such as Predictive Maintenance 4.0 to optimize machinery, SMED to reduce setup times, and SLP with digital support to improve route efficiency were implemented. With these improvements, validated through simulation in Arena software, the company was able to increase its OTD by 25.09%, reduce machine downtime by 47.87%, setup times by 39.99%, and distance traveled by 36.56%, according to the performance indicators defined for each root cause.

The district of Los Olivos, located in Lima, Peru, faces a worrying situation: a low recycling rate of 1.79%, even though more than 70% of the waste is potentially recoverable. This represents a growing threat to the environment, public health, and economic sustainability. Analyzing the causes, we identified a lack of awareness campaigns, a lack of infrastructure such as recycling containers or stations, irregular collection, and below-average salaries for recyclers. The analysis was carried out through a methodological approach based on a literature review, collection of official data from institutions, and comparison with success stories from other countries. Therefore, based on the principles of Circular Economy and Sustainability, an innovative proposal is proposed that integrates Supply Chain Management and Integrated Waste Management. This approach seeks to optimize waste collection and processing through adequate logistics and raise environmental awareness among citizens. The goals are to increase recycling rates and reduce environmental impact, contributing to a more sustainable and efficient waste management system."

Despite these benefits, IoT introduces cybersecurity risks that can be exploited by cybercriminals. This study examines IoT and cybersecurity impact in the Namibian mining industry. A qualitative approach was adopted, with data collected through semi-structured interviews with eight mining personnel. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the findings, and four key themes were revealed as follows: IoT deployment in the mining sector, risks and vulnerabilities of IoT devices, challenges posed by cyber-attacks, and cybersecurity strategies for IoT in mining operations. Findings identified IoT devices such as voice hubs, smart TVs, smartwatches, automation systems, and smart lighting as commonly used in the mining industry. The findings also, highlighted key threats including physical tampering, firmware manipulation, and vulnerability exploitation, with challenges ranging from financial losses to reputational damage and risks to individual safety. The study concluded that there is a need for cohesive strategies to improve IoT cybersecurity which must include education and training, contractual agreements, and adherence to policy standards."

Observations and interviews revealed several pain points, including delayed reporting, inconsistent formats among subcontractors, and limited access to real-time data. In response, a SUPER prototype was developed using Figma, featuring a unit population dashboard, Hour Meter data integration, periodic service and inspection monitoring, KPI visualization, and unit breakdown tracking. Usability testing with five users assessed effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. All users successfully completed the tasks, with an average completion speed of 0.427 goals/ sec, indicating fast and consistent performance. The System Usability Scale scored 76, placing it in the acceptable range. These results demonstrate that the SUPER prototype meets user needs and provides tangible benefits to PAMA, including improved operational efficiency, reduced reporting errors, and faster data-driven decision-making, while supporting SDG 9 through innovation and digital transformation in mining."

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence chatbots in programming education offers both pedagogical opportunities and cybersecurity challenges. This study examines Indonesian STEM students’ acceptance of AI chatbots through an extended Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2), which is used for programming learning with academic motivation while security issues are a concern. TAM2 was selected for its incorporation of output quality, where critical in programming where students evaluate AI-generated code accuracy, and its parsimonious framework directly linking perceived usefulness and ease of use to behavioral intention. Four contextual factors were integrated: Perceived Cybersecurity Risk (PCR), Expected Academic Achievement (EAA), Output Quality (Q), and SelfEfficacy (SE). Using PLS-SEM on 400 valid responses from six regions in Indonesia, findings show that Perceived Usefulness and Expected Academic Achievement are the strongest predictors of intention to use, while Self-Efficacy drives ease of use. PCR revealed a dual effect: reducing adoption intention yet unexpectedly increasing perceived usefulness, indicating security-conscious students apply more sophisticated evaluation frameworks. The model explained 51.7% of variance in intention and 52.4% in usefulness. Findings reveal that programming students adopt AI chatbots through pragmatic, outcome-oriented perspectives prioritizing demonstrable academic benefits, contributing to technology acceptance theory by exposing complex risk-benefit tradeoffs in high-cognition learning environments."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of online retail has created challenges in packaging efficiency, where inappropriate box selection and item placement lead to higher logistics costs, wasted space, and reduced sustainability. This study aims to minimize the number of boxes used per order while improving space utilization by formulating the problem as a 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). To address this objective, three heuristic approaches are evaluated the Greedy Heuristic (GH), Multi-Strategy Heuristic (MSH), and Extreme-Point (EP) methods. Using real operational data of up to $\\mathbf{1 0, 0 0 0}$ historical orders, the framework assesses each method’s trade-offs in box utilization, space efficiency, and computational performance. Experimental results show that the EP method achieves the lowest box usage and stable runtime performance, reducing box requirements by more than $65 \\%$ compared to GH while maintaining comparable air-gap efficiency. MSH provides competitive compactness through iterative refinements but produces slightly higher air gaps due to its adaptive search process. The study also reveals that persistent air gaps largely stem from limitations in the company’s box catalog, suggesting the need for catalog redesign to better match item dimensions. These findings highlight the importance of integrating box catalog optimization with algorithmic design. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive empirical benchmark and practical guidance for developing data-driven, cost-efficient, and packaging strategies in high-volume fulfillment operations."

    "abstract": "This research focuses on modeling urban vehicle emissions using machine learning techniques applied to OBD and GPS data, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional models such as IVE and EURO 6 standards. The implemented methodology included collecting emissions, GPS, and OBD data under real-world driving conditions along two Real Driving Emissions routes in Cuenca, Ecuador. A machine learning model was trained using data from the first route, followed by validation using data from the second route. The results were encouraging: the OBD-based model achieved a coefficient of determination ($\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$) of $\\mathbf{0. 9 4 7}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}_{\\mathbf{2}}, \\mathbf{0. 9 3 1}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}$, and $\\mathbf{0. 9 2 8}$ for $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$, demonstrating high predictive accuracy compared to direct measurements obtained using a PEMS system. Meanwhile, the GPS based model, which estimated dynamic variables such as longitudinal acceleration and road gradient, achieved $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ values of $\\mathbf{0. 9 1 6}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}_{\\mathbf{2}}, \\mathbf{0. 8 9 5}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}$, and $\\mathbf{0. 8 9 1}$ for $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$. The emission factors estimated by the OBD model were $\\mathbf{1 7 1. 6 g} \\boldsymbol{g} / \\mathbf{k m}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\boldsymbol{,} \\mathbf{1. 5 8 ~ g} / \\mathbf{k m}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}$, and $\\mathbf{0. 2 3 ~ g} / \\mathbf{k m}$ for $\\mathbf{N O}_{\\mathbf{x}}$, with absolute deviations of less than 6% compared to field measurements. The GPS model provided similar emission factors: $\\mathbf{1 7 6. 2 ~ g} / \\mathbf{k m}$ for $\\mathbf{C O}_{\\mathbf{2}}, \\mathbf{1. 7 1 ~ g} / \\mathbf{k m}$ for CO, and $\\mathbf{0. 2 6 ~ g} / \\mathbf{k m}$ for $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ further confirming the robustness of both methodologies. These results not only validate the accuracy of the models but also highlight their relevance in estimating emissions in urban contexts, adapting to the specific topography and climate conditions of Cuenca. As such, their use is recommended for developing emission inventories and designing more suitable urban mobility policies, instead of relying on international models such as IVE, which often overestimate emissions under local conditions especially in areas with unique altitudes and driving patterns."

    "abstract": "System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) mitigate operational challenges in power systems but increase the risk of cyber-attacks. Previous works in the literature primarily focus on improving security within the SIPS perimeter. However, research on SIPS commands to remote sites remains limited. Furthermore, current studies overlook the distributional ambiguity of cyber-attacks, limiting the ability to assess risk comprehensively. To address this gap, this paper proposes a STRIDE-based threat modelling framework that leverages the Wasserstein metric to characterise variability in the probabilistic impacts of cyber threats. Based on the probabilistic impacts, this paper introduces the threat exposure scores for ranking the vulnerable elements within a cyber-physical system (CPS) and the threat categories. The proposed framework is applied when SIPS sends commands to offshore wind farms to limit their generation after the failure of the transmission line. We decomposed the system into 27 critical components in cyber layer modelling and defined 205 attack vectors. We used the IEEE 24 bus test system to model power system response to cyber-attacks. Threat exposure scores are computed based on probabilistic impacts, attack persistence, and attack sophistication, considering a 5% acceptable ambiguity in the attack characterisation. Simulation results of attack vectors reveal that Elevation of Privilege and Information Disclosure are the most critical threats capable of halting SIPS commands to offshore wind farms. The proposed approach for characterising the probabilistic impacts of cyber threats can be used for different types of SIPS and other power system architectures, providing a practical tool for threat assessment in complex CPS."

Successful IT strategies allow businesses to innovate by using new technologies, which contribute to adapting to changing market conditions. That is why the article analyses five groups of indicators by which the success or failure of the IT used can be assessed. These indicators are integrated into a proposed measure that determines a generalized index of IT success. The results of the tests conducted in a medium-sized IT company unequivocally prove the applicability of the proposed approach to assessing IT success. The described results can be helpful for managers and consultants in preparing various reports and assessments related to digital transformation."

Utilizing data from the Hornad River in Slovakia, the research highlights the role of high-resolution geodetic surveys and remote sensing technologies, including multispectral cameras and LiDAR, in enhancing flood risk assessment. Key methodologies include the generation of bathymetric models, roughness maps, and integration with hydrodynamic software such as HEC-RAS versions 6.5 and the new RAS 2025 Alpha. The findings emphasize the improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy enabled by the new mesh generation capabilities of RAS 2025, reducing preprocessing time and handling high-resolution geodetic data effectively. Comparative analyses demonstrate similar modeling outcomes between the new and previous versions, despite the simplified calibration. The study also explores the application of neural networks for roughness mapping, utilizing Land Cover Segmentation models to refine hydrological inputs. While the results validate the feasibility of using RAS 2025 for advanced flood modeling, limitations due to the lack of calibrated historical flood data are noted."

We present Dynamite, an AI-assisted system that enables semantic updates to instructor-authored slides during live classroom discussions. These updates are powered by semantic data binding, which links slide content to evolving discussion data, and semantic suggestions, which offer revision options aligned with pedagogical goals. In a within-subject in-lab study with 12 participants, Dynamite outperformed a text-based AI baseline in content accuracy and quality. Participants used voice and sketch input to quickly organize semantic blocks, then applied suggestions to accelerate refinement as data stabilized."

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing competitions are increasingly used by firms to tackle internal R&D tasks; however, the reliability of solutions generated through these competitions remains underexplored. This study examines how social incentives influence solution reliability in such contests. Drawing on the attention-based view (ABV) and the exploration-exploitation (E- E) framework, we frame social incentives as attentional cues that redirect participants' focus toward socially visible performance metrics. This shift in attention can disrupt the balance between optimizing explicit performance and maintaining implicit reliability. To test this hypothesis, we leverage a natural experiment on a machine learning contest platform, where the introduction of a “following” feature generated exogenous variation in users' exposure to social incentives. Our empirical results indicate that this feature negatively affects solution reliability. The robustness of this finding is confirmed through multiple checks, including assessments of parallel trends, placebo tests, difference-in-difference-in-differences models, regression discontinuity in time analyses, and instrumental variables. Further analyses reveal that participants who gained followers or followed others submitted more solutions; however, these submissions were less reliable. Notably, high competition intensity mitigated this negative effect. This study contributes to the engineering management literature by addressing a crucial but understudied aspect of crowdsourced R&D projects: solution reliability. By integrating the E-E framework with ABV, it also advances research on open innovation by framing reliability as an attentional outcome shaped by social incentives rather than as a purely technical attribute. Overall, the findings reveal an unintended consequence of social incentives and provide actionable guidance for managers overseeing crowdsourced R&D initiatives."

Therefore, these results bode extremely well for the realization of E-mode GaN/AlGaN HEMTs, without thinning of the top-barrier layer, and thereby compromising the device characteristics."

To lighten the communication load, the constraint design is performed offline and an event-triggering mechanism is included, so that the nodes only need to transmit their local state estimates to neighbors at event instants during online execution. We prove constraint satisfaction and stability of our proposal, and we include simulation results showing that similar control performance to the centralized case can be achieved by our distributed SMPC with reduced communication."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) reshapes the AI model training paradigm by enabling privacy-preserving collaborative learning, where models are trained across distributed clients without sharing raw data, but only model parameters or updates. This learning can be centralized or distributed. Centralized FL (CFL) may suffer from latency and lack of robustness due to the reliance on a coordinating server for model convergence. On the other hand, Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables direct collaboration among participating devices without relying on a central server. Each device can independently connect to other devices and share model parameters. In such collaborative training paradigm, model convergence in the presence of various deployment topologies, AI model types, Non-IID data distribution, and training strategies demands systematic analysis to realize their practical deployment in critical applications such as intelligent transportation, smart factories, and real-time surveillance. Some works have attempted to conduct only partial analysis and completely neglected incorporating Non-IID data distribution, a critical factor in practical deployment of DFL in mentioned applications. This work conducts a systematic analysis on the convergence of DFL considering a wide range of AI models (e.g., classical, deep neural networks, and Large Language Models), network topologies (e.g., linear, ring, star, and mesh), training strategies (e.g., continuous and aggregate), and degree of Non-IID data distributions. The analysis includes both mathematical formulations and their implementation and evaluation using real-world data. The results confirm that the convergence rate of the models is inversely proportional to the degree of Non-IID data distribution. Moreover, judicial selection of network topologies and training strategies can aid in this convergence process for the practical edge deployment of DFL."

    "abstract": "Video face detection and recognition in public places at the edge is required in several applications, such as security reinforcement and contactless access to authorized venues. This paper aims to maximize the simultaneous usage of hardware engines available in edge GPUs nowadays by leveraging the concurrency and pipelining of tasks required for face detection and recognition. This also includes the video decoding task, which is required in most face monitoring applications as the video streams are usually carried via Gbps Ethernet network. This constitutes an improvement over previous works where the tasks are usually allocated to a single engine due to the lack of a unified and automated framework that simultaneously explores all hardware engines. In addition, previously, the input faces were usually embedded in still images or within raw video streams that overlook the burst delay caused by the decoding stage. The results on real-life video streams suggest that simultaneously using all the hardware engines available in the recent NVIDIA edge Orin GPU, higher throughput, and a slight saving of GPU engine power consumption of around 300 mW, accounting for around 5%, have been achieved while satisfying the real-time performance constraint. The performance gets even higher by considering several video streams simultaneously. Further performance improvement could have been obtained if the number of shuffle layers that were created by the TensorRT framework for the face recognition task was lower. Thus, the paper suggests some hardware improvements to the existing edge GPU processors to enhance their performance even higher."

Through thermal resistance analysis, it is possible to achieve a high effective thermal conductivity of 0.88 W/(cm·K) and low operational temperature with 60 chips stacked on a GPU. This represents three times the number of chips compared to conventional parallel chip stacking. While MOSAIC exhibits good heat dissipation capability, there is a strong trade-off between heat dissipation capability and system performance. To gain a systematic understanding of the MOSAIC system, a thermal model analysis is developed. This provides designers with an optimal solution for MOSAIC design that satisfies both good heat dissipation capability and SoC performance."

    "abstract": "Recently, the study on pinching-antenna technique has attracted significant attention. However, most relevant literature focuses on a single-cell scenario, where the effect from the interfering pinching-antennas on waveguides connected to spatially distributed base stations (BSs) was ignored. To fulfill this knowledge gap, this letter aims to provide an analytical framework on performance evaluation for multi-cell pinching-antenna systems where spatially distributed waveguides which are connected to different BSs are considered. In particular, tools from stochastic geometry is applied for system modeling. The expression for the outage probability is obtained. Simulation results are provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of pinching-antenna system compared to fixed-antenna systems."

    "abstract": "The reliability of a ridge waveguide AlInGaAs strained O-band InP laser design is characterized by means of 10 khrs of accelerated life test. Multiple stress conditions are used to estimate the device wear-out activation energy and bias current exponential factor using the Eyring equation. Time to failure for each stressed device is obtained from the parametric accelerated life test data. The laser operation bias current degradation is used to extract failure distributions. These distributions agree well with lognormal fits and are used to calculate the wear-out activation energy and bias current exponential factor. An activation energy and an exponential factor above 1.5 eV and 3, respectively, are obtained from operation bias current degradation analysis. Based on five stress conditions calculated acceleration factors, single digit failures in time are expected after 10 years of continuous operation."

    "abstract": "A polarization controlled dual-polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna with enhanced isolation for full-duplex wireless body area network (WBAN) in the 5.8 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band is proposed. The advanced polarization control of each antenna element comprising the MIMO antenna is realized by embedding tailored T-shaped strips within the transversal slots of a main diagonal cut in the ground plane, which effectively steer the surface currents to a favorable direction to achieve the desired polarization with enhanced isolation. By slotting the twin circular patch radiating elements and incorporating twin capacitively coupled stepped elements adjacent to their feeding terminals, the proposed low-profile design realizes good impedance matching, return loss, and bandwidth. Experimental results demonstrate isolation greater than 5 dB compared with existing designs, and we report inter-port isolation that exceeds 33 dB for the 150 MHz bandwidth, with a peak isolation of approximately 67 dB. As a result, the proposed antenna exhibits low envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), high diversity gain (DG), and acceptable total active reflection coefficient (TARC) and channel capacity loss (CCL). A prototype antenna was tested under structural deformation by bending it along a -45∘ direction, with a simulated specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0.258 W/kg on a human phantom, thereby validating the antenna’s compliance with safety standards. The findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed design effectively addresses critical challenges in full-duplex WBAN antennas by enhancing port isolation, minimizing mutual coupling, and advancing polarization control, while maintaining a low-profile and low-complexity feeding network structure."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of initial heading alignment for the conventional vehicle-mounted microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) in satellite-denied and magnetically disturbed environments, this article proposes a novel iterative self-alignment method that eliminates the reliance on precision rotating mechanisms. First, based on observability analysis, a flexible stop-turn-stop strategy is designed for self-alignment. By reusing data to maintain virtual rotation, the alignment time is significantly reduced. Second, an online iterative progressive compensation method for IMU bias is developed, allowing zero-velocity and zero-angular-rate corrections during vehicle stationarity. This enables autonomous bias compensation without external assistance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated through simulations, turntable experiments, and vehicle tests. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the method, achieving a breakthrough in heading self-alignment for conventional medium- to high-grade MEMS IMUs and providing a new solution for its application in complex environments."

This makes reliable month-ahead, hour-by-hour demand forecasts essential. This paper proposes a practical framework to generate such forecasts from historical data and to derive allocation coefficients compliant with the submission requirement. Several persistence-based predictors are used to capture recent individual-load behavior, and their outputs are combined through an ensemble that learns data-driven weights from past errors with the aim of improving upon the individual predictors. The approach is evaluated on real hourly data for 15 residential customers, showing a satisfactory performance of the proposed method compared with the individual predictors and results that are acceptably close to a theoretical baseline in which loads are assumed to be known in advance."

    "abstract": "Multimodal UI design and development tools that interpret sketches or natural language descriptions of UIs inherently have notations: the inputs they can understand. In AI-based systems, notations are implicitly defined by the data used to train these systems. In order to create usable and intuitive notations for interactive design systems, we must regard, design, and evaluate these training datasets as notation specifications. To better understand the design space of notational possibilities for future design tools, we use the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework to analyze two possible notations for UI sketching. The first notation is the sketching rules for an existing UI sketch dataset, and the second notation is the set of sketches generated by participants in this study, where individuals sketched UIs without imposed representational rules. We imagine two systems, FixedSketch and FlexiSketch, built with each notation respectively, in order to understand the differential affordances of, and potential design requirements for, systems. We find that participants’ sketches were composed of element-level notations that are ambiguous in isolation but are interpretable in context within whole designs. For many cognitive dimensions, the FlexiSketch notation supports greater intuitive creative expression and affords lower cognitive effort than the FixedSketch notation, but cannot be supported with prevailing, element-based approaches to UI sketch recognition. We argue that for future multimodal design tools to be truly human-centered, they must adopt contemporary AI methods, including transformer-based and human-in-the-loop, reinforcement learning techniques to understand users’ context-rich expressive notations and corrections."

The research evaluates whether ASTM A1011, with its superior mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, constitutes a viable alternative to ASTM A500 Gr C, a material commonly employed in the manufacture of bus bodies in Ecuador, which are characterized by being robust and heavy. The study focuses on two specific welding processes applied to a representative joint configuration, selected from a section of the metallic structure of domestically manufactured bus bodies. The extracted samples were subjected to tensile strength, ductility, toughness, microstructural, and hardness tests to determine the properties influencing joint performance. The findings reveal significant differences in the mechanical properties of welded joints between the base materials. Microstructural analysis shows an increase in carbon content within the fusion zone of the welded joints, mainly due to metallic inclusion from the filler wire used. Furthermore, the results are correlated with the requirements established by the applicable ASTM standards and the legal implications associated with the fabrication of welded structures under Ecuadorian regulations."

In response to this problem, an intelligent and autonomous electric wheelchair is proposed, capable of detecting, analyzing and overcoming sidewalks of up to 20 cm without external assistance. The system incorporates RGB-D cameras, sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and ultrasonics, and deep learning algorithms managed by a Raspberry Pi embedded unit for real-time autonomous navigation. Its design includes a scissor-type front lifting mechanism or articulated arm to safely traverse urban curbs and slopes, with a strong and lightweight structure made of 6061-T6 aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced polymers. In addition, low-consumption brushless motors (BLDC) and lithium-ion batteries are used to ensure extended autonomy in complex urban environments. This proposal represents a technological and social advance towards more inclusive cities, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 10 and 11). The system was validated through machine learning-based torque predictions and classical physics models, showing up to 15% higher accuracy in dynamic conditions. Additionally, simulations with users of different body masses (60–100 kg) confirmed safe and adaptive performance, reinforcing the robustness of the proposed design compared to existing commercial solutions."

The results of validation against ImageJ (reference standard) showed a 95% concordance with an average error of 3.49%, within the clinically acceptable margin (5%). The metric calibration achieves a spatial resolution of $14.15009 \\mathrm{px} / \\mathrm{cm}$, guaranteeing accuracy in measurements. The analysis of 50 plantar images confirms the robustness of the system in contour detection and calculation areas, supported by a strong statistical correlation $(r=0.990, R 2=0.979)$. These results validate the reliability of the MV 7000 for possible clinical applications, including quantification of pressure areas and morphological analysis, with potential to implement convolutional neural networks (CNN) in future developments for automated classification of pathological patterns."

Different models were implemented and compared across three tasks: final g rade p rediction, a cademic p erformance classification, and anomaly detection, contrasting traditional approaches with ontology-enhanced versions. While statistical models outperformed the quantitative metrics, the ontology-driven models proved competitive, more structured, and offered greater traceability. This study highlights the potential of ontologies as a complementary tool for machine learning, particularly in contexts where knowledge sustainability is crucial. This project establishes a foundation for further applications in educational domains and other areas involving high semantic complexity."

    "abstract": "E-commerce has experienced rapid growth in recent years, offering convenience and accessibility to millions of consumers worldwide. However, this growth also brings operational challenges for businesses, among which order cancellations have emerged as a significant concern. Cancellations not only disrupt logistics and inventory management but also increase operational costs and reduce customer trust, affecting overall business performance. This study proposes a framework for predicting and explaining order cancellations in e-commerce by combining machine learning with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. A dataset of 6,372,704 unique orders was used, incorporating order-related, customer-related, and operational features. Three machine learning algorithms, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. The evaluation shows that XGBoost achieved the best performance, slightly outperforming Random Forest. Meanwhile, Logistic Regression performed poorly, particularly in terms of the precision score. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) was then applied to interpret the XGBoost model, revealing that the most influential features vary across different sales groups. For high-value orders, quantity and payment method had the strongest influence, while payment method was also most significant in medium-value orders, and voucher usage had the most effect in low-value orders. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI can help to make targeted interventions to minimize order cancellation costs."

    "abstract": "The development of a modern paradigm for the use of cognitive and, in particular, generative machines (GM) in the field of education and the learning process raises several fundamental questions for discussion in the community of educators across the entire disciplinary spectrum. On the one hand, the existence of different understandings of the essence of such a paradigm builds the thesis for the formation of its following categories: GM-driven, in which the learner is considered a recipient; GM-supported, in which the learner is regarded as a collaborator; and GM-empowered, in which the learner is viewed as a leader. On the other hand, its distinctive features are personalized learning, the mentoring role of teachers in the learning process, and the high complexity of the learning applications. The need for a regulated application of this paradigm in the learning process requires the use of a working framework with predefined categories, forming a functionally complete system \"learning process\" — \"pedagogical goal\", and the revised Bloom's taxonomy is considered a suitable tool for this purpose."

However, although the industrial sector represents a high percentage of consumption, its growth has been negative, so commerce and public lighting emerge as priority candidates to initiate self-generation processes due to their stability and growth. Technical, legal and social criteria are incorporated, establishing a structured methodological process: review of the legal framework, technical analysis, consumption forecasts, visualization, interpretation of results and decision-making.

    "abstract": "The report examines the application of hybrid intelligence as a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise for driving sustainable innovation in industrial and energy systems. The study aims to demonstrate the potential of HI to reduce the energy consumption, carbon emissions, and production costs in line with global goals for sustainable development and climate neutrality. The methodology includes a mixed approach: quantitative data analysis (Bulgaria, EU, global), mathematical modelling and a simulation of a 30-day production process. The results show an average 15% reduction in energy, 10% in emissions and 11% in costs, with the effect being most significant for enterprises with large production volumes. Although the practical implementation uses deterministic Excel simulation with percentage calculations, these methods serve as simplified analogues of artificial intelligence techniques. The simulation validates the conceptual assumptions and provides a statistical baseline for the future integration of advanced AI methods such as regression forecasting, neural networks, and optimisation algorithms."

While this approach accelerates prototyping and lowers barriers to entry, it also introduces risks including frequent and unstable code changes, reduced readability, and a lack of accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Prompt–Refactor– Verify (PRV) cycle, a lean, human-centered framework that adapts prompt engineering techniques to AI-assisted programming."

    "abstract": "This study examined how the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm could be used to improve urban route planning, using a simulation based on the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Four city locations were represented using Cartesian coordinates, and the distances between them were calculated with the Euclidean formula. The experiment was conducted in Python 3.13.0, applying NetworkX and Matplotlib for modeling and visualization. The ACO algorithm was configured with four ants and ten iterations, using standard parameters such as pheromone importance, evaporation rate, and heuristic influence. The results showed that the ants generated distinct routes. The most efficient path—C4, C3, C1, C2, C4—was identified early in the process, with a total length of 241.45 km. The variability in the solutions highlighted ACO’s ability to explore multiple possibilities within the search space. Compared to other heuristic techniques like Genetic Algorithms, Tabu Search, or Simulated Annealing, ACO showed a more flexible and stable performance, particularly in dynamic urban environments. These qualities suggest that ACO could be a valuable approach for tackling routing problems in cities, especially when conditions such as traffic or delivery constraints are in constant change. While results were promising, future research is encouraged to evaluate ACO in more complex urban scenarios and explore how tuning its parameters might enhance its performance in real-world applications."

We benchmark countries by jointly analyzing national-level posture (ITU GCI), government implementation capacity (NCSI), and digital readiness (NRI), together with an application-level Web Security Index (WSI) computed from HTTP security headers of the top 1,000 user-visited websites per country. WSI is defined on a 0–150 scale (50 points each for Content Security—CS, Cross-Location Security—CLS, and Network & Protocol Security—NPS); in our 2024/2025 snapshot, the highest observed country score is ~120, reflecting gaps primarily in CLS policies. We (i) make our WSI reproducible via a transparent rubric and collection pipeline, (ii) quantify where policy-level indices align—or diverge—from practical web hardening, and (iii) provide country-specific recommendations. Results show a consistent regional gap in CLS, partial alignment between GCI/NCSI and NPS, and multiple policy–practice mismatches around CSP adoption. We discuss limitations and directions for follow-up comparative studies."

A user study with 29 participants showed that Codigen can assist teachers in generating quality programming materials. Statistical analysis showed that Codigen supports learners’ confidence and learning outcomes in programming. The perceived utility and engagement with the tool were also statistically significant.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) is a method of optimising the operation of power systems by selectively disconnecting transmission lines in order to minimise costs while ensuring that the solution remains feasible. Traditional MILP-based methods are computationally expensive when applied to large-scale networks. This paper therefore proposes a hybrid heuristic method involving greedy pre-filtering, whereby the MILP problem is replaced by a series of linear programming (LP) problems. The method begins by solving an optimal power flow (OPF) problem under the assumption that all lines are connected. This is followed by the iterative disconnection of lines with low utilisation, with solution feasibility being checked at each step using LP. This approach reduces the computational burden by transforming the problem into a series of LP tasks and avoids the exponential complexity of the branch-and-bound method. Experiments on IEEE test systems with 3, 14 and 30 nodes demonstrate that the proposed heuristic achieves near-optimal solutions while reducing computation time by 50–80% for systems with over 100 nodes, as confirmed by literature on heuristic OTS methods. This method is suitable for real-time decision support systems (DSS) and can be extended using machine learning techniques to predict which lines to disconnect, making it a practical tool for managing operational power systems."

This paper will share the results of evaluating options for a combined heat and power (CHP) plant to supply energy to the CCS facility. Several CHP options were evaluated, and a combustion turbine selection was recommended. The addition of CHP can increase the project NPV by running consistently and providing power to the grid when the cement plant isn’t running."

Considering the significant influence of these parameters on the health of employees, the morbidity of workers was chosen as a criterion for the effectiveness of occupational safety. The research was carried out for one of the main areas in a garment factory of a sewing company - the area for moisture-heat treatment. To increase the efficiency in ensuring safe working conditions, the air temperature is constantly recorded over time, using a computer-integrated measurement system. The studies were carried out for two periods - cold and warm periods of the year. Using the methods of two-factor analysis of variance, the influence, separately and jointly, of air temperature and the physiological regime of work and rest on the morbidity of workers is established. The results obtained create conditions for making quick and accurate decisions to increase the efficiency of processes for ensuring occupational safety as well as for their mathematical modeling."

This scenario worsens with the emerging demands of the automotive market, such as the transition to electric vehicles, which require more agile, efficient, and sustainable inventory management. While previous efforts have focused on traditional inventory control techniques, these are insufficient in complex environments where traceability and digital planning are decisive. In this context, the present study aims to develop an improvement model to increase inventory turnover through the integration of tools such as Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Winters forecasting, a Warehouse Management System (WMS), and Material Requirements Planning (MRP), under the Industry 4.0 and sustainability approach. The proposal seeks to systematize vehicle-level data, optimize inventory availability, and ensure efficient communication regarding the status and location of units. The model was validated in a real dealership through performance indicators, achieving an $85 \\%$ increase in turnover, a $13 \\%$ reduction in unplanned purchases, a $5 \\%$ decrease in unregistered vehicles, and a $5 \\%$ reduction in delivery delays due to stockouts. It is concluded that integrating emerging technologies with traditional methodologies significantly improves operational efficiency, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for other sectors with high inventory turnover."

    "abstract": "We investigate why inventors choose specific collaborators and how different collaboration patterns shape the relationship between network stability and exploratory innovation in interdisciplinary contexts. Using nano-energy patents (1998-2021) from the Derwent World Patent Index, we find that collaboration network stability hinders exploratory innovation, and this effect is moderated by assortativity. We classify collaborations into two types based on inventors' assortativity and network location: high assortativity collaboration, where core (peripheral) inventors work with others in similar locations, and low assortativity collaboration, where inventors collaborate across different network locations. We further examine how these collaborations influence the impact mechanism, challenging the conventional assumption of core-core collaboration. Robustness tests, including narrowed sample windows and alternative variable measures, confirm the consistency of results. Our findings provide nuanced insights into how partner selection and collaboration structures affect exploratory innovation, offering practical guidance for managers seeking to design effective collaboration strategies in technology-driven and interdisciplinary organizations. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Managerial Relevance Statement-</i>This study offers actionable insights for managers tasked with organizing and leading innovation teams in dynamic interdisciplinary environments. Our finding that network stability impedes exploratory innovation underscores the importance of reconsidering collaborator selection. Managers should carefully balance the benefits of predictable, stable networks with the need for fresh perspectives. Notably, individual inventor collaborative preferences—the tendency to collaborate with similar peers (assortativity)—should also be closely monitored. As the effects of these preferences vary depending on an inventor's position within the network, organizations should promote cross-boundary collaboration, particularly between core and peripheral members. Such collaboration fosters the exchange of heterogeneous ideas and mitigates cognitive inertia. By aligning collaboration preferences with strategic network locations, organizations can sustain exploratory innovation and remain competitive in rapidly evolving technological landscapes. This study also contributes to the following SDGs: SDG 7, SDG 17."

    "abstract": "This work presents the design and implementation of a Multiply-Accumulate Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (MAC-DWPT) architecture for estimating power quality indices on a Field-programmable gate array. In conventional DWPT, increasing the wavelet filter order improves power quality indices estimation accuracy by reducing spectral leakage, but it also increases hardware usage, lowers operating frequency, and raises power consumption. The proposed MAC-DWPT overcomes these limitations by maintaining nearly constant resource utilization, operating frequency, and power consumption regardless of the wavelet filter order. For the proposed MAC-DWPT architecture (using the Daubechies mother wavelet, db8) implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA AC701 board, Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization is reduced from 54.12% to 42.63%, Flip-Flop (FF) utilization from 15.41% to 10.57%, and DSP slice utilization from 96.39% to 39.59%, compared to the conventional DWPT. In addition, total on-chip power consumption is reduced by approximately 52.08%, while the design maintains an operating frequency of about 130 MHz, independent of the wavelet filter order."

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of single-phase-to-ground (SPG) faults in distribution networks is essential for rapid fault isolation and reduced power interruptions. Existing approaches often address only one aspect of fault diagnosis, suffering from low reliability, heavy communication requirements, and high investment costs. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a comprehensive fault diagnosis method based on phase-to-phase current fault components (PPCFC). The fault characteristics of PPCFCs are firstly analyzed on both the substation and feeder sides, taking into account the practical configuration of current detection devices. The results show that, in faulty feeders and sections, the fault-phase-related PPCFCs are significantly larger than the healthy-phase-related ones, while in healthy feeders and sound sections, all three PPCFCs remain close to zero. The PPCFCs are then calculated with consideration of possible triggering delays under high impedance faults, and their amplitude features are extracted. Based on this analysis, a fault phase and faulty feeder identification method is developed using PPCFCs from a single feeder at the substation side. In addition, a distributed location strategy is proposed, which employs local indicators to accurately determine the fault section via simple binary communication. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness and practicality."

    "abstract": "This article develops the performance recovery-based state-triggered fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy for nonlinear interconnected systems (NISs). Under discontinuous state transmission, a novel set of event-triggered chainlike filters is introduced to reconstruct the error coordinate transformation, effectively addressing the challenge of state-triggered nondifferentiability. Then, a dynamic redundancy fault-tolerant control method is presented, which is tailored to constrain full errors and ensure prescribed performance, even in the face of actuator faults. It is capable of handling different types of faults, including moderate faults and extreme faults, and explicitly takes deferred actuator switching into account. By exploiting the performance function, the exceeding errors can be recovered into the safe constraints even after complete actuator failure. Besides, the globally uniformly ultimately bounded of closed-loop signals is realized without dependence on any unknown initial conditions. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by a practical example."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates covert transmission in semantic communication systems, with a particular focus on protecting sensitive information embedded in images. While current research on semantic secure communication emphasizes semantic confidentiality, it often overlooks the covertness of semantic content. To bridge this gap, we propose a semantic covert communication scheme comprising a semantic covert artificial noise module and a deep learning module. The semantic covert artificial noise module ensures that the covertness-oriented artificial noise (CoAN) lies within the null space of the legitimate user’s channel, so that it perturbs only the eavesdropper while preserving the legitimate user’s ability to recover semantic information. The deep learning module is designed to distinguish sensitive content from the background in an image. Furthermore, the semantic covert communication neural network is trained using a customized information-bottleneck–inspired loss function that simultaneously enhances the semantic expressiveness of the representation observed by the legitimate user and improves the semantic representational capability of the CoAN at the eavesdropper, thereby inducing the eavesdropper to misinterpret the transmitted information as background. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme conceals sensitive information from the eavesdropper’s perspective while maintaining high-fidelity semantic recovery for the legitimate user."

    "abstract": "Financial market forecasting in portfolio formation has increasingly drawn interest within machine learning due to its complex temporal dynamics and high volatility. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have demonstrated efficacy in image-based tasks, their direct application to time series data remains limited. To address this, we propose a prediction-based portfolio optimization framework that converts stock price sequences into Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, enabling spatial feature extraction via a ResNet. Temporal dependencies are captured using a LSTM encoder, forming a hybrid GAF + ResNet-LSTM model. To be specific, this paper first applies these prediction models for asset preselection before portfolio construction. Then, this paper incorporates their predictive results in advancing nested clustered optimization (NCO) method, which clusters assets based on predictive confidence and allocates weights using intra-cluster optimization. In order to balance calibration and classification, Training employs walk-forward validation and a composite loss combining mean squared error and directional accuracy. The empirical study is conducted on a dataset comprising 25 stocks from the National Stock Exchange of India, spanning January 2014 to January 2024, including periods of market disruption such as the COVID-19 crash. Thus the sample makes it possible to catch subtle market shift for model execution. Moreover, we compared the performance of the proposed model against equally weighted and mean-variance portfolios to underscore the advantages of the NCO model. The proposed model achieves a 21.05% annual return with a Sharpe ratio of 1.31, outperforming benchmark architectures. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the benchmark portfolios, particularly for investors with a high risk-return preference. Statistical significance is further corroborated by t-tests. Based on these findings, we advocate the integration of our comprehensive portfolio optimization model into investment decision-making processes."

    "abstract": "Green transformation has become a global consensus, but enterprises often treat it as a symbolic strategy rather than a substantive commitment. While existing studies have examined how internal capabilities and external pressures influence enterprise green actions, few have explored how digital transformation enables external green strategies such as green mergers and acquisitions (M&A), or how CEO career concerns shape such decisions. This study examines the impact of digital transformation on green M&A among Chinese A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2023, with an in-depth analysis of the moderating role of CEO career concerns in this process. The results show that digital transformation significantly promotes green M&A, particularly when CEOs face external and prospective concerns, whereas internal career concerns weaken this effect. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the digital–green relationship varies by CEO characteristics, industry type, and enterprise characteristics. The study enriches the understanding of sustainable strategic decision-making mechanisms in engineering management. It offers enterprises guidance on aligning incentives to promote the synergy between digital transformation and green transition."

It maintains the hierarchical design of cascade control, with an outer-loop controller overseeing the main process variable and an inner-loop control action derived rather than directly measured. The method simplifies setup and reduces instrumentation costs, making it ideal for educational environments and cost-sensitive industrial applications where frequent disturbances reduce the performance of basic feedback controllers."

    "abstract": "Stroke is a very serious global health problem, and accurate early detection is necessary to minimize its burden. A stroke prediction model integrating the Random Forest (RF) with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is introduced here for solving the class imbalance in medical data. The data, collected from Bangladesh, contains 5,110 samples and 11 features with only 249 stroke cases. To ensure data quality, a strong preprocessing pipeline was followed that involved data selection, encoding for categorical features, KNN Imputer imputation for missing values, removal of outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and min-max normalization. SMOTE was then applied to balance data. The current work is combination of SMOTE-based resampling and RF classification, made possible by intensive preprocessing and Gain Ratio-based feature selection. It improves both data representation and prediction. Experimental results show that the model suggested employing SMOTE ($k=5$) and achieved 95% accuracy, with 829 True Positives (TP), 59 False Positives (FP), 786 True Negatives (TN), and 19 False Negatives (FN). These findings highlight the strength of integrating oversampling and ensemble learning for predicting health tasks. This work provides fresh understanding of handling imbalanced health data. Future research could extend this approach and explore other sampling methods, more advanced feature selection techniques, and hyperparameter adjustment"

    "abstract": "Modern cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, requiring complicated defense techniques to be able to detect them, making traditional defense methods inadequate. This research presents an automated architecture with open source solutions, integrating a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system based on Wazuh that executes correlation rules and matches correlations from Suricata alerts and the lists of the MISP for confirmed threats, Suricata, a high-performance Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for network detection and malicious pattern detection, and a Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP), which is continuously enriched by the updated URLhaus database of indicators of compromise (IoCs), which contains datasets with malicious URLs and receives data from MISP through an automated continuous flow. Automated Python scripts have been created to run via cron jobs and their purpose is to extract IoCs by connecting to the MISP API and then converting them into Suricata rules. The proposed integration improves event correlation and accurately detects all malicious IoCs in the specific database, leading to a more efficient detection of known threats."

    "abstract": "In most industrial applications, induction motors (IMs) are fundamental to the automation, generation and transfer of energy, making them a reliable and economical choice. Their continuous operation causes significant stresses on electrical and mechanical parts of the system. Bearings are one of the key mechanical components that play a critical role in shaft motion, offering reduced friction and smooth rotation under various load conditions. Recent research studies have shown that bearing faults occupy the highest percentage of failures in IM. In recent years, the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence systems have contributed to the development of predictive maintenance methods to monitor, assess and diagnose potential future failures. The present study focuses on the creation of an experimental setup that includes an IM and its corresponding control system to collect real time vibration measurements. Our experiments were based on the six different operating states of the bearing in healthy operation and under fault conditions. The proposed methodology includes statistical analysis of the data and development of a machine learning algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique for classification and automatic diagnosis of the bearing condition."
