    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming essential visual monitoring technologies in various fields including urban planning, environmental monitoring, traffic surveillance, and disaster response. Nevertheless, there are some challenges in detecting objects in UAV imagery since the targets can be very small, densely packed, and acquired under unstable conditions such as shifting lighting, cluttered backgrounds, and flying motion. These factors make the already hard job of small object detection (SOD) even harder. SOD needs particular labelling strategies, model modifications, and deployment considerations.With a focus on small objects, this tutorial guides participants through the whole UAV imagery labelling and object identification pipeline. We start with annotation guidelines and dataset characteristics unique to aerial perspectives, followed by a general overview of the evolution of object detection architectures from two-stage detectors to real-time one-stage frameworks. The focus then moves to the latest YOLO-based techniques, emphasizing attention mechanisms, multiscale feature fusion, architectural modifications, and efficiency-focused designs specifically suited for UAV applications. We will also discuss enhancements to training, improvements in inference time, and accuracy vs. computational efficiency trade-offs for platforms with limited resources.By the end of the tutorial, participants will have a better understanding of the difficulties associated with UAV-based small objects detection, practical knowledge of labelling and model construction, and a taxonomy of efficient techniques for enhancing deployment in the real world."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant control (FTC) is essential for maintaining the stability of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Quadrotors can maintain stability during rotor failure via sacrificing yaw control. However, hybrid UAVs, such as lifting-wing quadrotors, generate substantial aerodynamic forces at high speeds, making it difficult to directly apply the fault-tolerance strategies existing for quadrotors. This article proposes a control approach that leverages aerodynamic forces from the wings to compensate for the thrust and moment losses caused by rotor failure, enabling the aircraft to maintain nondegraded flight. First, the theoretical feasibility of this strategy is assessed through controllability analysis. Based on this analysis, a passive fault-tolerant controller is developed that permits normal operation under unknown failure conditions. Additionally, the controller can handle different aileron malfunctions. Furthermore, the closed-loop stability of the attitude system under the proposed controller is analyzed and verified. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the controller is first tested in a model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulation to assess its response under different failure conditions. Subsequently, real-world flight tests using onboard sensors and GPS are performed to verify the performance of the proposed controller in practical operational environments."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation of mobile robots in urban environments is crucial for independent travel for the elderly or disabled populations. However, existing robot urban navigation solutions usually rely on the precise coordinates of the target location, and do not comply with traffic rules during navigation. To this end, this paper proposes a demand-oriented robot navigation solution in urban environments based on vector-semantic map (V-S Map), where V-S Map integrates geometrically precise vector layer generated using a Transformer architecture, and task-related semantic layer derived via optical character recognition and point cloud registration. Unlike current mapping approaches, V-S map uniquely incorporates directional road attributes and task-relevant semantic information to address traffic violations in urban navigation while establishing the relevance of tasks to the environment. Furthermore, we develop an LLM-based command parsing strategy that combines optimized prompt engineering with regular expression matching against location lexicons extracted from semantic layer. This strategy eliminates traditional coordinate-input constraints, enhancing human-robot natural language interaction capabilities. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed solution in terms of ambiguous command parsing and robot navigation performance, achieving an 80% overall task success rate with a 63.78% path-violation weighted success rate."

    "abstract": "5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based emergency communications have attracted considerable attention for their rapid deployment and high-capacity links enabled by UAV mobility and mmWave capabilities. However, most existing studies prioritize service coverage optimization, often neglecting accurate 6D pose estimation of users and UAV-mounted base stations (BSs) calibration, which are crucial for robust beam alignment, positioning, and navigation. Traditional approaches generally assume known BS poses, an assumption invalidated by UAV mobility and deployment uncertainties, resulting in degraded positioning performance. To tackle the challenge of inaccurate BS poses, we first leverage multi-view geometry to estimate clock bias, thereby correcting synchronization errors, and subsequently derive an initial estimate of the user’s 6D pose using delay and angle measurements. Building on this, we propose a multi-view joint estimation framework that simultaneously estimates the user’s 6D pose and calibrates BS poses. This framework integrates a manifold-based BS pose uncertainty model with a hybrid maximum a posterior estimator, which combines prior pose information with the geometry of the Special Euclidean Group <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SE</i>(3). To benchmark performance, we derive a hybrid Cramér-Rao lower bound under uncertain BS pose priors. Simulation results verify that the proposed method significantly enhances user pose accuracy under BS pose uncertainty, achieving about 75% error reduction compared with the conventional method at a representative transmit power."

The proposed electromagnetic topology simplifies microgenerator fabrication processes while improving both coil fill factor and winding self-inductance. This configuration enables automatic voltage regulation across the operational range of 20,000–160,000 r/min under constant load conditions. Optimized for high-speed turbine applications, the topology demonstrates superior power density. The methodology section systematically details three key aspects: magnetic circuit closure principles, parametric optimization of the U-core stator, rotor integrity validation at 160,000 r/min through stress analysis. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms precise DC output voltage regulation (12–48 V) and power variation across the full load spectrum. Notably, rectification exhibits approximately linear voltage decay characteristics. To validate the simulations, a prototype was fabricated and experimentally evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate strong agreement with simulation data, collectively achieving the desired design objectives."

    "abstract": "Small-object detection plays a critical role in real-time aerial, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and satellite vision systems, as well as many other domains, where hardware constraints and deployment environments demand high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Although numerous lightweight object detectors have been proposed, there exists a lack of rigorous, cross-platform benchmarks that evaluate these models under consistent conditions for small-object-focused applications. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of eight recent lightweight You Look Only Once (YOLO)-based models, including YOLOX-Nano and YOLOv6–v12 variants. Models are trained using a unified pipeline and evaluated on three representative datasets: VisDrone2019, DOTA-v1.5, and xView. Performance is assessed on both cloud GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and an edge AI platform (Jetson Orin Nano), using PyTorch and TensorRT (FP16) runtimes. The evaluation metrics include mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, F1-score, latency, FPS, memory footprint, and energy consumption (via VDD_IN telemetry). Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-Nano and YOLOv9-Tiny achieve leading accuracy across datasets, while YOLOv6-Nano and YOLOv10-Nano offer favorable trade-offs in speed and memory. TensorRT optimization yields 3×–5× speedup over PyTorch. Energy draw ranges from 7.6 W to 10.4 W, depending on the model and configuration. Pareto frontiers reveal that no single model dominates across all objectives. The study highlights the importance of multi-objective benchmarking in edge AI and provides practical guidance for selecting detectors based on deployment-specific constraints. The findings support theory-driven and application-oriented advancement of efficient detection architectures for real-time, resource-aware computer vision systems."

    "abstract": "The inherent variability in human performance introduces stochastic perturbations into manufacturing environments, undermining the seamless coordination required for effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) systems. While human cognitive flexibility enhances adaptability, it simultaneously acts as a source of operational uncertainty, complicating the modeling and optimization of integrated robotic systems. Given these challenges, there is an urgent need to substantially expand the adaptability of robotic systems through real-time detection, algorithmic analysis, and dynamic behavioral adjustments in response to human performance fluctuations. The systematic development of such systems capable of precisely detecting task-specific variations, analyzing them via advanced AI algorithms, and adapting their behavior accordingly remains a critical focus of contemporary research. To evaluate progress in this domain, this study conducts a systematic literature review, synthesizing advancements across 124 publications and identifying underexplored research frontiers. The findings reveal a persistent misalignment between current technical capabilities and the requirements of adaptive collaboration in dynamic industrial environments. Key gaps include the absence of explainable AI frameworks for transparent decision-making, limited generalizability of adaptive control architectures, and a lack of proactive strategies that anticipate rather than merely react to performance deviations."

This study introduces an extensive framework aimed at embedding HAR functionality into industrial settings to promote workplace safety, streamline operations, and facilitate predictive maintenance. Through AI techniques, HAR problems can be achieved with high accuracy. However, traditional AI models require centrally trained data on remotely powerful cloud servers. This leads to issues with privacy and security of health records and increases latency. To address this problem, the Federated Learning (FL) technique was proposed. FL allows distributed training on the patient’s IoT devices and serves as the communication mechanism between local devices and the FL aggregator. Thanks to this architecture, the health data needs only to be stored locally on its devices without being uploaded to data centers, thus ensuring security and reducing service response times and computational costs. In this study, we implement FedANN and FedConvNN independently in a federated learning setting to address human activity recognition problems toward real-time applications. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the based on the variation initiation of the number of different training clients. The results show that the FedConvNN solution improves accuracy and reduces model and communication complexity compared to FedANN and centralized training models, with the potential for real-time deployment in HAR tasks.

In this work, we present a 3D cUSi system tailored for CA imaging, consisting of a 240-element matrix probe with a 40 × 24 mm² large aperture and a spatial encoding mask. We describe the system’s design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications."

    "abstract": "Bathymetry is a crucial topographic element in shallow water. When retrieving bathymetry using the semi-analytical (SA) model, issues of too many unknown parameters and difficulty of obtaining substrate spectrum should be addressed. In this research, a Case-I water Semi-analytical Bathymetry retrieval Model assisted by a Pixel substrate spectrum (SBM-P) is proposed for multispectral images to retrieve bathymetry without prior information. Firstly, the substrate spectrum of each pixel is obtained with the assistance of the ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data. Secondly, the SA bathymetry retrieval model for Case- I water is reparametrized. Thirdly, the optimal objective function is selected in the process of numerical optimization. Finally, the performance of the proposed SBM-P model is evaluated. Two datasets, Oahu Island (OI) and Vieques Island (VI), are prepared for experiments. Results show that the Minimum Distance and Spectral Angle Matching (MS) objective function has better performance compared to the Minimum Distance (MD). For example, in the bright substrate of OI case, compared to MD, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) of MS decrease by 2.07 m, 1.61 m, 43.1%. Compared to the generally used Semi-analytical Bathymetry retrieval Model using a Fixed substrate spectrum (SBM-F), the SBM-P demonstrates improvements in the evaluation metrics: for the OI case, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RMSE</i> decreases by 0.75 m, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MAE</i> by 0.67 m, and the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MRE</i> by 40.1%; similarly for the VI case, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RMSE MAE</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MRE</i> reduce by 0.84 m, 0.7 m, and 19%.

However, most existing anomaly detection approaches only detect deviations from the global expected patterns, while overlooking anomalies that conform to the global expected patterns but deviate from the local expected patterns. In this paper, we propose DALAD, a novel distribution-adversarial-learning-based anomaly detection approach for microservice systems, which jointly learns the normal and anomalous system pattern distributions to effectively detect both global and local anomalies. In detail, DALAD first designs an adversarial data generation strategy to automatically generate anomalous traces at a low cost. Then, Distribution-Adversarial-Learning Trace Representation is designed to jointly learn the multivariate-Gaussian-distribution-based vector representations of normal and anomalous traces, which can reflect the difference between traces in a more fine-grained manner. Finally, it further models the normal and anomalous system pattern distributions from these vector representations, and detects anomalies by comparing the likelihoods of traces under these distributions. Experimental results on two datasets show that DALAD achieves the best anomaly detection performance while maintaining a competitive computational cost."

    "abstract": "A fan-powered tailsitter is capable of operating in both rotary-wing and fixed-wing flight modes. The transition between these modes is critical due to strong disturbances and considerable control complexity. This article investigates a predefined-time stability tracking control problem for tailsitters subject to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Based on the second-order dynamic model and high-order fully actuated (HOFA) system approach, a high-order robust controller is first developed to address the limitations of existing mode transitions, particularly in terms of control accuracy and disturbance suppression capabilities. On this basis, a novel predefined-time HOFA scheme is proposed by introducing adjustable parameters, which enables the system states to converge into a small neighborhood of the desired equilibrium within a prescribed time, while providing flexible tuning of the convergence time to adapt to varying mission and environmental requirements. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves enhanced control accuracy, faster convergence, and improved robustness compared with conventional approaches. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed HOFA-based predefined-time framework allows explicit tuning of the convergence time and provides robustness guarantees under parameter uncertainties, an aspect that has not been sufficiently addressed in the current literature."

However, FOWLP faces several manufacturing challenges, such as coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, warpage, die shift, and postmolding protrusion, causing misalignment and bonding issues during redistribution layer (RDL) buildup. In order to address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive defect analysis and testing framework for FOWLP interconnects. We use Ansys Q3D to map defects to equivalent electrical circuit models and perform fault simulations to investigate the impacts of these defects on chiplet functionality. Additionally, we present a built-in self-test (BIST) architecture to detect stuck-at (SA) and bridging faults while accurately diagnosing the fault type and location. We also show how fault signatures can be propagated and decoded across multichiplet interfaces to initiate dynamic repair. To enhance postfabrication yield and reliability, we introduce a priority-based dynamic repair scheme aligned with the universal chiplet interconnect express (UCIe) specification that maximizes repairability without incurring additional hardware overhead in the I/O PHY. This framework offers a practical path toward robust and efficient testability in the next-generation advanced packaging."

However, for systems whose dynamics are characterized by a high state dimension, substantial nonlinearities, and stiffness, suitable methods for online nonlinear MPC are lacking. One example of such a system is a vehicle thermal management system (TMS) with integrated thermal energy storage (TES), also referred to as a hybrid TMS. Here, hybrid refers to the ability to achieve cooling through a conventional heat exchanger or via melting of a phase change material (PCM), or both. Given increased electrification in vehicle platforms, more stringent performance specifications are being placed on TMS, in turn requiring more advanced control methods. In this article, we present the design and real-time implementation of a nonlinear model predictive controller with 77 states on an experimental hybrid TMS testbed. We show how, in spite of high dimensions and stiff dynamics, an explicit integration method can be obtained by finding a suitable linear system at each time step within the MPC horizon online. This integration method further allows the first-order gradients to be calculated with minimal additional computational cost. Through simulated and experimental results, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution method and the benefits of TES for mitigating highly transient heat loads."

    "abstract": "This research addresses the challenges faced by firmware developers, security researchers, and enthusiasts who work with low-level microcontroller (MCU) documentation, which often spans hundreds of complex pages. Current structured approaches, such as System View Description (SVD), are widely used but suffer from manual, labor-intensive creation processes and inconsistent vendor adherence to CMSIS-SVD standards. We propose an automated solution using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), capable of effectively parsing and extracting structured information, including text, tables, and images from MCU reference manuals/ datasheets. To mitigate hallucination issues inherent in LLMs, we fine-tuned models using a dataset derived from CMSIS-SVD files, which we will open-source for community benefit. We also experimented with few-shot models. Additionally, we developed a standardized structured ontology that is automatically populated with information extracted through LLM assistance from the reference manuals of the corresponding MCUs. Our approach was evaluated using OpenAI's GPT-4o under one-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios, all incorporating RAG. We also experimented with the open-source LLM model CodeLlama. The results highlight substantial improvements in automatically extracting peripheral details and information from MCU reference manuals. Thus, it helps reduce manual effort and time. The key contribution of our work lies in the tailored adaptation of existing AI techniques to address the specific challenges of embedded systems documentation. We perform standardized ontology creation and multimodal parsing. We leverage RAG with MCU-specific finetuning and few-shot learning to generate structured information from hundreds of pages of MCU documentation. This opens the door to potential applications such as more accurate firmware code generation and reverse engineering for security analysis."

Quantitative research was conducted using a questionnaire consisting of closed-ended questions, which was based on previous international and Greek research literature, on a sample of 522 principals working in schools during the school years 2021-22 and 2022-23. The findings demonstrate that women educational leaders face additional obstacles compared to men in building an administrative career. In addition, new technologies contribute significantly to the updating of administrative work, as well as to the provision of upgraded quality services to the educational community. The results show the principals as enthusiastic supporters of the use of ICT in the effective administration of educational institutions. Subsequently the technological capabilities they offer for immediate and rapid electronic services make their application in educational administration essential."

    "abstract": "Object detection is the backbone of many contemporary robotics applications, enabling the detection and categorization of objects within an image and serving as a fundamental component of robotic perception. In the ever-evolving landscape of computer vision and object detection, the demand for realtime and accurate algorithms has never been more pressing, with applications becoming increasingly time-sensitive. Research efforts continue to advance in two primary directions: the development of larger neural networks with additional layers to improve accuracy and the optimization of neural modules to enhance computational efficiency. A common approach to achieving the desired inference speed, even with optimized neural modules, involves downscaling the input image to ensure that the model operates at the required frequency. However, this downscaling often results in a loss of critical information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, scalable neural network architecture designed to perform object detection on high-resolution inputs in real-time on embedded devices commonly used in robotic perception systems. Our primary focus is on weed detection in agricultural fields, where the ability to distinguish fine-grained details is essential for differentiating weeds from crops. Additionally, we investigate the conditions under which input resolution is more beneficial than model capacity and examine the trade-offs between them. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in precision agriculture, highlighting the necessity of high-resolution input for accurate weed identification and localization."

While digital technology and social media have expanded access to renewable energy information in Indonesia, they have also facilitated the spread of misleading hoaxes. To address this challenge, artificial intelligence (AI) can play a key role in filtering credible information. In this study, we introduce a multimodal dataset consisting of text, audio, and video. The methodology includes a literature review, collection of social media content, and classification of valid versus false information by 16 evaluators. Their assessments were then compared with evaluations made by students who had studied renewable energy. The dataset was analyzed using a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance. The results show that Sample 11 performed best, achieving the highest precision, accuracy, F1-score, and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). In contrast, Sample 2 performed the worst, with the lowest recall, F1-score, and mIoU. These findings suggest that a person’s academic or professional background influences the accuracy of hoax detection. This research contributes not only by providing an openly available multimodal dataset on Mendeley, but also by encouraging the development of multidisciplinary models to improve hoax classification and filtering through machine learning."

    "abstract": "Personalized recommendation is one of the flourishing AI applications in recent years. However, its powerful functionality comes with the need of a significant amount of embeddings, which hinders the model performance by causing large memory footprints. In addition, each inference request requires multiple memory access to these embeddings, which puts even more stress on the already-suffering memory bandwidth. In this paper, we aim to reduce the storage size of the embeddings required by personalized recommendation while inducing minimal impact on the accuracy. To achieve such goals, we take advantage of the fact that not all data contribute equally towards the final result. Small values and less frequently accessed embeddings have little impact on the accuracy. In addition, we opt to avoid any extra steps of training to restore the accuracy since training recommendation models can take hours, consuming a huge amount of computing power, which is undesirable. Instead, to restore accuracy, we further identify the insight that some data, although less frequently accessed, do not offer good storage reduction-accuracy trade-offs. Following these key guidelines, we judiciously choose certain embeddings to apply element-wise pruning, leaving the rest untouched. We are able to prune the embedding data by more than 99% while inducing less than 1% accuracy drop."

This manuscript proposes a deep learning model combining an Autoencoder with a Fully Connected Neural Network (AFC-NN) for modeling the dynamic nonlinear behavior of ADCs. The model leverages discrete-time input and output sequences of the ADC within a supervised learning paradigm, enabling single-step prediction of the output encoding from continuous-discrete time-domain input sequences. The AFC-NN model proposed in the manuscript has the following advantages. Its strong nonlinear fitting capability and inherent time-series memory capacity obviate the requirement for researchers to depend on a priori knowledge (e.g., nonlinear order or memory length). The modeling process utilizes random sequences as test stimuli, enabling accurate prediction of the dynamic response to sinusoidal stimuli with varying frequencies and amplitudes. Experimental validation is conducted using an 8-bit pipeline ADC as the target device. Results demonstrate that the AFC-NN framework achieves excellent fitting performance within the Nyquist bandwidth, with a time-domain sequence prediction Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 0.375 LSB, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) error of less than 1 dB, and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) error of approximately 2 dBc."

This study focuses on the mechanism of vehicle drivers' emotions acting on driving risks. First, it elaborates on the process mechanism of how emotions affect driving risks. Second, by monitoring driving behaviors under different emotional states and quantitatively analyzing risk levels using a driving risk calculation model, a dynamic transmission chain of \"emotional activation— behavioral alienation— risk accumulation\" is constructed. Finally, a quantitative evaluation model of \"driving emotion-risk\" is established. The research data show that among driving emotions, pleasant and neutral emotions correspond to the lowest risk levels, while the other five emotions significantly increase driving risks."

    "abstract": "An important feature of modern vehicle safety technology is the detection of drowsiness in the driver, which helps to prevent accidents caused by dozing drivers. It's evident from earlier research that twenty percent of road accidents are the result of driver drowsiness. The development of technology for detecting or preventing drowsiness while driving is a crucial issue for accident-avoidance systems. To counteract the effects of tiredness while driving, various methods must be developed. One of the biggest technical challenges in the automobile industry is the development of safety features to prevent drunk and drowsy driving. It is clearly known that driving under the influence of a drug or being tired is one of the most common causes of road accidents, particularly in the modern era. An assistive system that monitors the alertness level of drivers can greatly reduce the number of accidents. Through the development of this system, it is intended to detect drowsiness in drivers with visual features and drunkenness using alcohol sensors. Driver drowsiness is determined using HAAR-Cascade classifiers for detecting the face and eye of the driver in real-time. Moreover, the system will be equipped with an alcohol detection sensor that will be able to determine whether the driver is under the influence of alcohol, thus providing coverage for genuine reasons of road collisions."

    "abstract": "In artificial intelligence, enhancing agents’ perception and decision-making in physical environments is a key research focus. Perception and control, as essential components of task execution, interact closely and jointly determine system performance. Traditionally, agents use perception models to extract environmental information and control algorithms to generate actions. However, in real-world scenarios, the choice and combination of perception and control models can greatly affect efficiency and accuracy, demanding stronger adaptability and robustness. To study these effects, we design a simulation platform for path planning tasks built on the OpenAI Gym framework. The platform is flexible and scalable, supporting integration and evaluation of diverse perception-control algorithm combinations. Based on this platform, we conduct experiments with different perception-control pairings and further propose a perception optimization mechanism driven by control feedback, namely online evolutive learning mechanism. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the perception model within the closed-loop system, enabling agents to adapt online and respond more effectively to environmental changes. Experimental results show that perception-control combinations yield notable performance differences under identical conditions. Moreover, the proposed optimization mechanism significantly accelerates convergence and improves execution efficiency in non-stationary environments, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing system robustness and adaptability."

This paper aims to develop a methodology for prioritising these smart energy services through multicriteria analysis, with the goal of better understanding priorities across different cases and different market actors.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a groundbreaking new robust intelligent control strategy (Robust Fuzzy-Evolutionary Control (RFEC)) based on the fusion of fuzzy logic and evolutionary generative optimization. This approach leverages the nonlinear mapping and adaptability of fuzzy logic control (FLC) and combines it with a generative optimization mechanism guided by an evolutionary algorithm. This fusion modeling achieves the global optimal configuration of controller parameters. The RFEC framework embeds the Lyapunov adaptive control law into fuzzy-evolutionary optimization. This operation ensures global stability of the system under strong nonlinearities, parameter uncertainty, and external disturbances. Three enhanced membership functions are used in the input fuzzification process, and gradient correction and Cauchy projection constraints are introduced as an evolutionary generative optimization mechanism. This operation significantly improves the convergence and stability of the search in high-dimensional parameter spaces. The performance of RFEC was experimentally tested on a two-dimensional strongly coupled nonlinear dynamic system using the MATLAB environment. Furthermore, the performance was compared with adaptive fuzzy control (AFLC), particle swarm-genetic hybrid optimization (PSGA), nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), and gain-scheduled control (GSC). Results show that RFEC achieves the best trajectory tracking accuracy. Numerically, the peak error is 0.043, and the recovery time is the shortest under transient disturbances. RFEC also achieves the best balance between control accuracy and energy consumption.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a model for day-ahead optimal planning of a residential photovoltaic battery system with consideration of planned grid interruptions is proposed and evaluated. The objective function is a minimization of electricity cost while planned grid interruptions are considered through constraints. The day-ahead optimization is done according to the hourly forecast data, while the evaluation is done with the 1-minute data. The results of day-ahead optimization are the reference battery current and the start times of time-shiftable appliances. A day-ahead model is evaluated through 1-minute simulations for scenarios with planned and unplanned grid interruptions, and with a new and degraded battery. According to results, a system is capable of ensuring electricity supply during planned interruptions with a duration up to 3 hours, even with a degraded battery. When the duration of planned interruptions is up to 6 hours, electricity needs are met in all test cases with a new battery and not met in 0.5% of cases with a degraded battery. Even when interruptions are unplanned, a photovoltaic battery system met the electricity demand in 92.6% of cases with a new battery and 88.5% of cases with a degraded battery."

    "abstract": "The detection of brain tumor using the conventional methods of MRI images are critical and intense process now a days and hence it is necessary to have a deep learning models for an efficient detection of the tumors in the earlier stages with higher precision. However, such infrastructure is frequently lacking in remote clinical settings as well as point-of-care locations. To solve this problem, a Lightweight Neural Network called TinyBrainNet is suggested for better real-time brain tumor detection on medical devices with limited resources. The model uses depthwise separable convolutions, channel attention techniques, and compound network scaling to get high accuracy with less effort for the computer. Additionally, controlled pruning, knowledge distillation, as well as quantization-aware training are used to keep diagnostic performance while reducing model size and latency. TinyBrainNet, on the other hand, works on ARM-based devices with a model footprint of less than 5 MB and an inference latency of less than 25 ms per slice. This is better than or equal to what traditional deep models like ResNet, DenseNet, or UNet variations need, which require a lot of memory and GPU support. The standard datasets that involve BraTS, TCGA-GBM/LGG, and the Kaggle Brain MRI dataset are used in this research work to evaluate the proposed work. These datasets include both binary tumor identification and multi-class classification. The testing results show that the TinyBrainNet has an AUC of over 0.97 and an accuracy of 97.5% for multi-class tumor categorization. Grad-CAM-based visual explanations also make the model easier to understand, which makes it more trustworthy in a clinical setting. The suggested architecture is a good fit for clinical settings with limited resources and on-device medical diagnostics since it is scalable, energy-efficient, and protects privacy."

The research uses a simple adder logic to compute the number of ones in the input, a reconfigurable adder tree logic, further implementation reduced the total power consumed by the circuit, and also presents a new approach for computing the population count of the applied input bits (data). Here, it presents the simple computation over the conventional approach. Unlike the traditional methods, which focus only on the area and faster speed, the research works simply on minimizing the leakage power in the designed circuit. The design acts as a smart counter that only gets activated when the computational logic is in that path; otherwise, it remains off. The implementation also involves using High-voltage transistors (HVT) and Mixed input logic (MGD), which reduces the number of transistors. The proposed design reduces the power from 544.3 to 96.6nW, about 82.2%, where the complete advantage of this circuit can be consumed in the computation of a large number of bits. This advancement bridges the gap between the potential improvements in the further implications of computational logic."

    "abstract": "Subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are a latitudinally narrow band of intense westward plasma flows just equatorward of the auroral oval in the dusk-to-midnight ionosphere. SAPS are frequently observed by radars and satellites during geomagnetically active times. SAPS are produced when the downward Region-2 current is closed through the subauroral region of low ionospheric conductivity and a strong poleward electric field is established to ensure current continuity. SAPS are a manifestation of the strong coupling between the magnetosphere ionosphere and thermosphere. In this study, we employ the high-resolution Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment (MAGE) model developed by the NASA DRIVE Science Center for Geospace Storms (CGS) to simulate the SAPS effects on the global thermosphere-ionosphere system during the 17 March 2013 geomagnetic storm. MAGE can self-consistently generate SAPS and simulate their effects. In the SAPS channel, two processes occur to affect the thermosphere and ionosphere state, the first one is the intense frictional heating to the ionospheric plasma and atmospheric neutrals and the other one is the strong ion drag that changes the neutral winds. Our MAGE numerical experiments show that thermospheric temperature and wind circulation are modulated by the SAPS, and the SAPS effects are transmitted globally to affect the behavior of the entire thermosphere and ionosphere system during the storm. With SAPS included in MAGE simulations ionospheric total electron content and electron densities are enhanced in the afternoon sector at middle and high latitudes. This provides a strong source of ionization for the high-latitude convection pattern to transport the plasma into the polar cap to facilitate the occurrence and strengthening of polar cap tongue of ionization."

A multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization is applied to optimize the azimuth and elevation angles of base station antennas. The results demonstrate that while sacrificing only 1% of network coverage, the interference power can be significantly reduced by approximately 12.2 dB.

The simulation results show that the proposed discharge control strategy can effectively suppress the influence of DC side load mutation on bus voltage, and the response speed and robustness of the system are improved."

Existing model-based control methods rely on precise mathematical models and manual parameter tuning, struggling to adapt to complex dynamic environments. Learning-based approaches, meanwhile, suffer from difficulties in convergence under strong disturbances and insufficient safety guarantees. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a safe reinforcement learning control method based on higher-order control barrier functions (HOCBF) and disturbance observer (DOB). The proposed method employs a hierarchical design: reinforcement learning (RL) adaptively learns the optimal policy from data; HOCBF construct a safety layer to modify the RL agent's actions, ensuring system safety; and the DOB compensates for external disturbances like aerodynamic lift, enhancing convergence stability under strong disturbances. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the presented approach under three operating conditions, confirming remarkable improvements in convergence performance under strong disturbances and enhanced stability."

Space-based solar power technologies, particularly orbiting solar reflectors (OSRs), have emerged as an advanced solution to extend solar energy availability by reflecting sunlight from space to terrestrial solar power farms (SPFs) beyond daylight hours. This paper presents an approach to reduce power grid fossil fuel costs and carbon emissions by optimally integrating OSRs with a terrestrial SPF. The methodology employs a modified IEEE test system and optimal power flow analysis within a MATLAB framework to determine the optimal placement and sizing of the SPF for minimising active power losses, fossil fuel costs and carbon emissions. The research evaluates multiple operational scenarios, ranging from conventional generation to the combined operation of the SPF and OSRs. The results confirm that OSR integration substantially enhances SPF energy output during dawn and dusk hours, leading to lower fossil fuel costs, decreased carbon emissions, and improved voltage stability across the power grid. These findings underscore the potential for substantial economic and environmental benefits in future energy systems by seamlessly integrating OSRs technology with terrestrial SPFs."

    "abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities in generating RTL code from high-level functional descriptions of hardware modules. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the lack of high-quality, diverse datasets particularly for applications in IP design, verification, and security analysis. To address this limitation, we introduce MALLS, a multi-agent framework in which specialized LLM agents namely, a generator and a discriminator collaborate in an adversarial yet cooperative setting to improve the quality and correctness of RTL designs and curate a high quality synthetic hardware vulnerability dataset. In this architecture, the generator agent is responsible for producing RTL implementations from initial seed examples through in-context learning, while the discriminator agent assesses the generator's output for functional correctness and the presence of security vulnerabilities. This interaction creates a dynamic feedback loop, enabling both agents to iteratively improve through each other's responses leading to self-supervised learning. A hard bank of examples is maintained in a database which include instances that were difficult to generate or detect by either agents. By generating paired positive (correct) and negative (buggy) examples, the system learns to distinguish subtle design flaws and generalize across diverse RTL patterns while generating high quality synthetic examples of hardware vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that using the hard bank of examples produced by the adversarial multi-LLM setup improves both vulnerability generation and detection performance."

Most techniques require a detailed digital grid model, which is often not available. One major piece of information that tends to be missing are the line parameters. However, due to the increase in installed measurement equipment, line parameters can be estimated via data-driven methods. In low-voltage grids, two major challenges for such methods are customer connection lines, which link the grid customers to the main feeder line, and unknown customer order. To address those challenges, we propose a two-step line parameter estimation method, where first the correct customer order is determined, and then the line parameters are estimated. The method uses voltage and current measurements from smart meters, as well as substation or cable distribution cabinet measurement equipment. Using a case study, we show that the proposed method correctly determines the customer order for exemplary grids, and estimates line parameters with a median relative error below 0.3 %."

Chains are then grouped into seven activation levels, each mapped to a distinct toggle probability to balance power and test coverage. A configurable control circuit based on shift and hold registers generates the required low-power signals.

For tumors detected, a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)and K-Means clustering is applied to determine tumor stages, categorized as early, intermediate, or advanced.

    "abstract": "We introduce FlexPhys, a cookbook that researchers can use to operationalize data physicalization research questions through workshop design. While guidelines exist for running workshops in educational contexts, designing a data physicalization workshop when the goal is to answer research questions is an ad-hoc process for which little guidance exists, but for which many choices must be made (e.g., in terms of materials, tools, and data). We draw from our experience designing data physicalization workshops and from reviewing three existing workshops, to distill the cookbook's core ingredient (context and goal) and eight additional ingredients related to making (material, tool, technique), data encoding (data type, variable, mark/unit), and interactivity (interaction, sensory modality). We then show how FlexPhys can be used to describe and compare physicalization workshops, and to generate workshops that address specific data physicalization research questions."

    "abstract": "Measuring operational efficiency in dynamic and uncertain environments is a major challenge in modern decision-making systems. This study proposes a new approach, Incremental Stochastic Dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis with Real-Time Streaming Adaptation (ISD-DEA-RT), which integrates dynamic DEA, incremental optimization, and real-time data streaming into a single adaptive efficiency evaluation framework. Unlike conventional dynamic DEA models, which still rely on batch data, this approach enables direct updates of efficiency scores when new data becomes available, without reprocessing the entire historical dataset. Additionally, operational uncertainty is explicitly accommodated through interval-based uncertainty bounds, resulting in more robust and realistic efficiency measurements that account for data variability. The developed model was tested through a numerical example demonstrating ISD-DEA-RT's ability to update efficiency quickly and accurately while maintaining result stability amid operational fluctuations. This research contributes methodologically to the development of more responsive and practical dynamic DEA models and has the potential to be applied across various industrial sectors requiring real-time efficiency monitoring under uncertainty."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the feasibility of using a twisted pair transmission line RF coil, resonating at 300 MHz, to detect minute changes in local electrical conductivity resulting from increased cerebral blood volume (CBV) associated with neuronal activity. Functional activation—such as during visual, motor, or cognitive tasks—leads to heightened neuronal activity and metabolic demand, which in turn increases CBV by up to 20 %. This change alters the tissue conductivity in the activated cortex, enabling conductivity-sensitive measurements, such as electrical impedance, to serve as a potential mechanism for non-invasive monitoring of brain function. We evaluate this method using a dynamic anthropomorphic head phantom with a perturbation cavity and controlled saline flow, monitored by a 300 MHz RF field generated by a small, tuned RF coil based on an established MRI transmission line coil design. Experimental results demonstrate that the RF coil can successfully track conductivity changes of up to 3.2% in the phantom. Although this sensitivity falls short of detecting the expected 1.0% conductivity change during functional activation, the results validate a platform for future improvements in detection sensitivity."

    "abstract": "Large-scale networks play a pivotal role in modern urban engineering systems, driving economic growth, social connectivity, and environmental sustainability. However, traditional analytical methods struggle to address their inherent complexity and dynamic interdependencies, particularly under disruptions such as failures or evolving demands. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), with their ability to model spatial-temporal relationships and propagate dynamic impacts across interconnected nodes, offer a transformative approach to these challenges. This study proposes a multi-model framework integrating GCNs, clustering algorithms, and genetic algorithms to optimize Baltimore's network. A GCN-based prediction model analyzes the cascading effects of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, revealing a 31.3 % improvement in global network efficiency (E_“global”) post-reconstruction and a 29.6% reduction in community segregation (I_c) in West Baltimore. For pedestrian facilities, a hybrid queueing model dynamically adjusts pedestrian-vehicle signals, reducing average detour distances by 40 % near the US-40 highway and increasing pedestrian coverage by 56 %. A genetic algorithm optimizes bus stop distribution, achieving <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 0 - 1 0 0 \\%}$</tex> coverage in underserved residential clusters and reducing commuter travel times by 20 %.

    "abstract": "This research is conducted within the context of efficient multimedia information transmission. At the framework level, this model proposes an action key-frame compression and accurate decoding algorithm (CNR-NSA) based on complex domain residual networks and number-theoretic spectral analysis. This algorithm considers the practical challenge of compressing and restoring high-frequency keyframe information in action-intensive videos. Algorithmically, this model first designs a multi-scale complex convolutional residual network (MS-CResNet). The designed MS-CResNet applie the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\times 1,3 \\times 3$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 \\times 5$</tex> complex convolution kernels to concurrently extract local and global spatiotemporal features. Furthermore, a residual iteration mechanism ensures gradient stability. This model also designs a multi-layer number-theoretic spectral decomposition module and combines the Euler functions, Smarandache functions, and generalized least common multiple functions for joint modeling. Subsequently, multi-layer frequency-domain mapping is performed on the residuals to obtain frequency sparsification and key frequency enhancement. Local frequency correlations are captured through spatiotemporal-spectral coupling matrix modeling. The decoding stage includes inverse arithmetic coding, inverse spectral mapping, and inverse complex domain transform. This transform enables high-fidelity motion recovery. In comprehensive experiments, this paper constructs the ActionKey-1K dataset. At the same time, the UVG and UCF101 datasets were used for verification as a supplement. The method was compared with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\times 265$</tex>, DCVC, SRVC and latent ConvLSTM methods. The experimental results show that the BD-Rate of CNR-NSA on the three datasets reached <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-34.5 \\%, \\mathbf{- 3 0. 2 \\%}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{- 3 1. 0 \\%}$</tex>, respectively. This result shows significant bitrate saving capability; at medium bitrates, the MS-SSIM of ActionKey-1K is 0.937 and the VMAF is 88.3, while the MSSSIM and VMAF of the UVG dataset are 0.934 and 88.0, respectively. In addition, CNR-NSA achieves low computational complexity and high decoding throughput (FPS) while also ensures high compression performance."

    "abstract": "Species identification is essential in taxonomy to study the biodiversity in marine biotas. However, traditional and geometric morphological study is laborious, which can be alleviated with machine learning or deep learning methodology. In this research, a systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted to study machine learning and deep learning applications in marine biota morphology (landmark) detection. There are 21 manuscripts examined from the Scopus database and Google Scholar, comprising nine invasive and 12 noninvasive studies. Fish are the most observed marine biotas, followed by crustaceans and other species. This SLR identifies the standard pipeline for marine biotas landmark detection: data augmentation, calibration, object localization, and landmarking using machine learning or deep learning models. Additional preprocessing steps include pose normalization, color enhancement, and image or frame selection. This SLR also observed that the heatmap-based landmark detection approach suffers from multi-object occurrence in a single frame in noninvasive studies, leading to misplaced landmarks. This SLR proposes the utilization of instance segmentation for better localization to address this problem, ensuring that only one object is presented to the landmarking model. Besides instance segmentation, the exploration of Transformer-Based landmarking models and the initiative to propose a novel architecture are recommended future research suggestions, which are still rarely done in the collected studies. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically review the current advances of automatic morphology landmark detection."

In this study, the researcher suggests a powerful and smart product recommendation system that uses developed feature engineering, hybrid-clusters, deep learner, and ranking techniques to make effective recommendations. First, Multivariate Additive Independent Component Analysis (MAICA) is used to perform effective feature extraction, i.e., isolate independent latent variables of a complex high-dimensional dataset. Then, hybrid clustering algorithm based on the HAC and K-Means is executed to cluster similarity of product features and consumer interests and improve the accuracy and stability of the cluster. In order to further improve the feature set, Multi-Heuristic BAT Optimization Algorithm is introduced, which optimises the extracted features in order to achieve better learning results. A Deep Multi-layer U-Net Classifier is the core predictive model by which global and local patterns in data are captured to predict product relevance accurately. Lastly, the system uses the ranking-based recommendation strategy to rank and recommend the products that most suit the user intent and interests. The goal of this integrative approach is to be more successful than traditional recommendation methods in accuracy, scalability, and personalization. The relevance and accuracy of the recommendation has been established by experimental evidence and has proven useful in establishing the suggested system as a competitive solution in real-time, intelligent e-commerce recommendation. It is suggested that the following actions will be taken during the working process: adding user feedback loops and extending the framework to multilingual and multimodal data inputs."

However, this transition imposes various technical challenges, such as voltage violations, line congestion, and power quality issues in the distribution network. To address these challenges, an optimal power flow (OPF) model with second order cone programming (SOCP) formulation for optimal scheduling of the battery energy storage systems (BESS) has been proposed to simultaneously minimize voltage violations, line congestion, BESS degradation, and power loss in a balanced distribution network. If the capacity of the BESS is not sufficient to completely mitigate the voltage violations and line congestion, the magnitude and time intervals of the voltage violations and line congestion are also determined. Further, the proposed model gracefully deals with the non-convergence of power flow solutions and is scalable in terms of both network size and operating conditions. The proposed model is tested on a modified IEEE 33 bus and modified IEEE 906 bus networks. The results highlight the performance of the model in minimizing voltage violations and line congestion in the distribution networks."

In this paper, carbon-conscious computing gets reviewed with special reference to the alcoholic approaches to workload scheduling, offloading tasks, resource provisioning, and carbon footprint estimation. The most notable case studies are Google carbon-intelligent workload management, GreenScale edge-cloud scheduling, CASPER distributed web-service provisioning, market-driven edge AI optimization and the Green Algorithms footprint analysis tool. These approaches prove to have the ability to reduce emissions by up to 70 percent without affecting performance, latency, and cost. Other challenges that have been pointed out in the study include challenges in intermittency of renewable energy, computational overhead, and lack of standardized carbon measures. The future of the AI-based scheduling is predictive, further combination with the carbon markets, and cross-layer optimization of devices, edge, and data center. Carbon aware redesigning of algorithms is depicted as an important move towards making computing systems greener and more sustainable."

    "abstract": "During the total solar eclipse in the United States on April 8, 2024, we observed the amplitude and phase of VLF signals from five U.S. Navy VLF transmitters using a novel geometry of VLF receivers deployed along and across the totality path. Nine receiver sites (four of them inside the totality path) were deployed to collect the data in different transmitter-receiver configurations relative to the totality path, which intersected with the radio propagation paths from the Cutler, MA (NAA, 24 kHz) and the LaMoure, ND (NML, 25.2 kHz) Navy transmitters. The transmitters themselves experienced 98.7% (NAA) and 68% (NML) solar obscuration at 75 km altitude. The novelty of the observations is the near-total obscuration of one of the transmitters and observations of several radio propagation paths closely aligned to the path of totality. This configuration enabled observations of the effects of the Moon's shadow progression from Texas to Maine for over three hours on a total of 27 radio paths (with coverage from 55% to 100%) with transmitter-to-receiver distances ranging from 780 km to 7700 km. Both positive and negative (5–10 dB) amplitude changes were observed by receivers throughout the eclipse period. The observed phase changes were mostly negative. The unique observations of VLF propagation along the totality path produced a temporally dynamic quasiperiodic response in amplitude that can be used to determine the gradients and spatial scales of the eclipse effect on the lower ionosphere. For observations within 780 km of NAA, the eclipse produced a 13 dB surge in amplitude."

This study develops a coupled traffic–distribution network model that integrates origin–destination flows, road impedance, and power constraints to better reflect real-world dynamics. An enhanced Sparrow Search Algorithm is proposed to coordinate EVs charging and discharging, incorporating battery limits, travel behavior, and distribution network constraints. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared to baseline charging strategies, this proposed approach reduces voltage deviations, transmission line losses, and both EV and power system operating costs. Furthermore, renewable utilization improves due to better alignment between EV charging demand and renewable generation peaks. These findings highlight the value of coordinated EV scheduling in leveraging EVs flexibility to improve system stability and resilience under high renewable penetration, while respecting individual travel plans to preserve users’ convenience."

The approach leverages historical SCADA measurements, weather forecasted data and physically derived theoretical power curves to enrich the feature space. A diverse set of base models, including linear, tree-based, and gradient boosting regressors, are trained on a unified dataset, and their predictions are subsequently used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) meta-learner. This stacked ensemble methodology captures both the individual model strengths and their inter-dependencies, leading to improved generalization. Experimental results, based on a real-world dataset from a Vestas V52 wind turbine in Ireland, demonstrate that the meta-learner consistently outperforms the individual regressors in terms of accuracy, achieving <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> scores of 0.99. This proves that this study offers an effective solution for improving short-term wind power forecasting."

    "abstract": "The dual-stator permanent magnet direct-drive motor boasts advantages such as high torque density and high efficiency, making it a good alternative to traditional low-speed, high-torque transmission systems. Based on the theory of magnetic field modulation, this paper puts forward a double stator magnetic field modulation motor (DSMFMM)with split teeth and split teeth in concentrated winding to realize the design requirements of direct drive of wind power generation. The inner and outer windings of the motor are configured with a 9-slot and 8-pole concentrated winding, which effectively reduces the end effect and copper loss. In addition, both the inner and outer stators adopt the structure of split teeth and auxiliary teeth, which play the role of magnetic field modulation and can effectively reduce the magnetic flux leakage. In this paper, the theoretical expression of air gap magnetic field is deduced by magnetic circuit method, and its working principle is expounded in detail. The no-load performance and output torque characteristics of the motor were quantitatively compared. On this basis, based on the response surface method, sensitivity analysis method and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), the motor is optimized in different degrees. Finally, a prototype is manufactured and subjected to testing. Simulation and experimental findings confirm both the viability of the motor and the efficacy of the multi-level optimization design approach that has been proposed."

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks are continuously hitting more healthcare systems, and with weaknesses in digital hospital infrastructure exposing sensitive patient data and critical clinical processes, it is becoming a serious issue. Conventional centralized security solutions often fail because healthcare systems must comply with strong privacy regulations, have custodial access to their own data, and require real-time decision-making capabilities. To solve these problems, this paper proposes FED-XAI-SEC, a Federated Explainable AI Security Framework for healthcare networks. The main goals are to protect data privacy and ensure that threat detection can be made collaboratively among remote hospital hubs, along with providing transparent and understandable alerts that are compliant with healthcare practices and regulatory obligations. The technology uses federated averaging and secure aggregation to build local Random Forest intrusion detection models without transferring sensitive data. TreeSHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed for feature-level explainability, while a Bayesian optimiser balances latency and secrecy-rate tradeoffs at the edge. Evaluation reveals that the system delivers up to 96% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, with inference latency consistently less than 100 milliseconds per warning. Privacy is enforced using (ϵ < 3)-differential privacy to comply with standards such as HIPAA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation). This study presents a practical, clinician-friendly method for secure, explainable, and legally acceptable AI implementation in healthcare cybersecurity."

Due to limited computational and storage resources on edge computing devices within autonomous driving systems, there is an urgent demand for lightweight models capable of balancing segmentation accuracy and inference speed. Based on the above problems, this paper proposes a lightweight road image segmentation method based on the improved SegFormer, MS-SegFormer, which is based on the basic framework of SegFormer, replaces the backbone network with MobileNetV3-small, which meets the requirements of lightweight, while incorporating a SimAM parameter-free attention mechanism after the MLP layer to improve feature representation. Experimental validation conducted on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrates that MSSegFormer achieves a 6.6% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and reduces model parameters by approximately 54.8 % compared to the baseline SegFormer model. These results substantiate that MS-SegFormer effectively balances segmentation accuracy and inference speed for image processing models on edge devices, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the investment planning problem of a virtual power plant (VPP), formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. As the number of binary variables increases and the investment time horizon extends, the problem can become computationally intractable. To mitigate this issue, time series aggregation (TSA) methods are commonly employed. However, since TSA typically results in a loss of accuracy, it is standard practice to derive bounds to control the associated error. Existing methods validate these bounds only in the linear case, and when applied to MILP models, they often yield heuristics that may even produce infeasible solutions. To bridge this gap, we propose an iterative TSA method for solving the VPP investment planning problem formulated as a MILP model, while ensuring a bounded error in the objective function. Our main theoretical contribution is to formally demonstrate that the derived bounds remain valid at each iteration. Notably, the proposed method consistently guarantees feasible solutions throughout the iterative process. Numerical results show that the proposed TSA method achieves superior computational efficiency compared to standard full-scale optimization."

This design will inevitably occupy too much installation space. To address the above limitations and simulate fast-moving DWPT systems within a limited space, a design scheme for the circular experimental platform is proposed in this paper. Additionally, to ensure device reliability and minimize eddy current loss, the rotation radius, magnetic coupler, and information communication of the experimental platform are considered and designed. Then, a DWPT circular experimental platform, which could satisfy the simulation requirements for speeds up to 200 km/h, is constructed, and its circuit responses are tested under different speed conditions."

This article proposes a novel robotic dog system framework that can achieve autonomous line patrol, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and precise robotic arm collaborative grasping. Its core lies in a robust multimodal perception system. The system architecture integrates visual, LiDAR, and IMU data to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the environment and accurate estimation of the robot's own state. A key innovation of the system is the use of a hierarchical decision-making process to coordinate the movement and operation of robotic dogs. In terms of navigation, the system adopts an improved AI algorithm combined with real-time sensor feedback for line patrol, while utilizing a variant of dynamic window method (DWA) for local path planning and obstacle avoidance. The collaborative grasping module utilizes visual servoing and force feedback technology to achieve precise object interaction, and optimizes the workspace and grasping stability of the robotic arm through posture adjustment of the robot base. The experimental results show that the system can achieve a 95% success rate in line patrol and obstacle avoidance in cluttered paths, and an 85% success rate in specified object grasping tasks. Compared with the baseline method, it has improved task completion time and energy efficiency by 15-20%. This study provides a comprehensive system framework to enhance the autonomy and practicality of robotic dogs in diverse application scenarios."

The method constructs a feature layer and a semantic layer. In the feature layer, a cascade architecture of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract highly discriminative time-frequency features from RF time-domain response. In the semantic layer, a semantic matrix generation algorithm based on greedy search is designed to construct a single-fault semantic matrix through uniqueness constraints and combinatorial anti-resistant constraints. A composite fault modeling is carried out using the bit or operation. The mapping of single-fault samples from the feature layer to the semantic layer provides basic features, and a few number of composite fault samples are used to model the relationship from single-fault semantics to composite fault semantics. A greedy search algorithm is used in the testing phase to obtain the optimal matching of the composite fault components. Experiments show that the diagnostic accuracy is improved by 13.34% with only 2 samples for each type of composite fault."

    "abstract": "Motorised light vehicles, particularly two- and three-wheelers, play a crucial role in mobility and urban logistics across emerging economies, especially in Southeast Asia. While these vehicles offer resource-efficient transportation, their reliance on fossil fuels contributes significantly to air and noise pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Electrification of these fleets presents a viable pathway to sustainable mobility. Despite growing attention to electric cars, Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) remain underrepresented in policy and investment strategies in the region. This paper uses a socio-technical transition framework to analyse barriers to LEV adoption and proposes strategic action areas to accelerate their uptake. Key challenges include high upfront costs, limited charging infrastructure, lack of standardisation, and fragmented regulatory frameworks. The study draws on empirical data from surveys, interviews, and regional stakeholder engagements conducted during the development of ASEAN Guidelines on LEVs. It identifies five critical action areas: standardisation, financial and non-financial incentives, stakeholder collaboration, strategic policy frameworks, and incorporation of monitoring and evaluation measures. The findings underscore the need for coordinated public-private efforts, harmonised standards, and time-bound policy targets to unlock the environmental, social, and economic benefits of LEV adoption in Southeast Asia."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) battery degradation is a critical determinant of performance, cost, and longevity, particularly within diverse fleet operations. While extensive research exists on state of health (SoH) estimation and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, few studies present a unified framework that explicitly connects stochastic degradation dynamics with comparative maintenance cost modeling across heterogeneous EV usage sectors. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a Monte Carlo-driven simulation framework that integrates an exponential SoH degradation model perturbed with Gaussian noise, analytical RUL forecasting, and economic models for both preventive and corrective maintenance. The simulations reveal pronounced degradation disparities across private EVs, taxis, and buses, with commercial fleets exhibiting accelerated aging. For instance, bus batteries reach the 80% SoH threshold in only 41.8 days, compared to 424.3 days for private EVs. The framework captures RUL variability under uncertainty, enabling robust predictive decision-making. A comparative strategy assessment demonstrates that preventive maintenance triggered at a SoH threshold of 0.85 consistently minimizes total lifecycle cost, achieving 49% - 57% savings over run-to-failure strategies. These findings offer actionable insights for fleet managers to optimize asset utilization, for original equipment manufacturers to design usage-specific battery packs, and for policymakers to formulate evidence-based fleet sustainability guidelines."

The Kalman filter is employed to achieve two main objectives: (1) to estimate the non-measurable dq-frame PMSG stator currents, which are then used to directly compute the rotor position on the generator side, and (2) to remove the measurement noise from all estimated dynamic states for the full system (PMSG, DC-link voltage, LCL filter) and to attenuate high oscillations in the modulating signal to avoid saturation. Most of the existing methods estimate speed and then integrate it to obtain the rotor position, but an unknown initial position leads to inaccurate results. This paper proposes an alternative approach to calculate the position of the rotor, which relies on the estimation of dq-frame currents in conjunction with the measured stator currents. The estimator is integrated into an LMI-based robust H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</inf> MIMO control scheme, where the controller ensures stability, tracking, and disturbance rejection.

The high class imbalance in mobile banking transactions makes it difficult to detect fraud, as fraudulent events are less than 0.2 per cent of all transactions. This paper assesses the efficacy of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) as a class imbalance mitigation method and its effect on the performance of fraud detection. Using the PaySim dataset, four machine-learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, were evaluated with and without using SMOTE. The findings show that the ensemble models were always more effective than the more parsimonious classifiers; in particular, the Random Forest with SMOTE added to it had the highest F1-score (0.9973), precision (0.9988), and recall (0.9957). XGBoost using SMOTE achieved an F1-score of 0.9942 and ROC-AUC of 0.9992. Conversely, Logistic Regression and KNN, although with better recall (0.9799 and 0.7249, respectively), had significantly lower values of precision (0.0689 and 0.1228) and a high rate of false positives. Moreover, SMOTE significantly decreased the training time of Random Forest by 89.44 s to 2.97 s, which increased the efficiency of the computations. These results support the fact that the integration of SMOTE and ensemble classifiers is a powerful and scalable method of detecting fraud in mobile banking settings."

However, existing INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3) dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on scientific data encoding tasks."

The fluctuation is problematic for electricity consumers and for both production and consumption investments. Energy storage could stabilize the day-ahead electricity market, but the problem is the prediction of the timing of charging and discharging and the strong cannibalization of their economic profitability, which is also desired from energy storage. This paper presents a proposal for a new order type for bidding in the day-ahead electricity market, in which the price-setting algorithm would determine the optimal timing for the use of energy storage. In addition, a benefit compensation procedure linked to the new order type is proposed, which would prevent cannibalization and increase the attractiveness of the day-ahead market for energy storage. This could stabilize the price fluctuation of the day-ahead market."

It focuses on developing a machine learning model that can assist in forecasting potential crime scenes and times, allowing us to take action before damage is done. This work urges us to reframe safety as care, support, and astute intervention before things go wrong, rather than as punishment after the fact.

    "abstract": "Multi-view camera-based 3D perception has achieved significant progress in enabling autonomous driving. Nevertheless, several critical challenges remain. First, the underutilization of multi-scale features and limited semantic representation capacity impede the accurate extraction of discriminative object characteristics across different scales. Second, the conventional self-attention mechanism in decoders suffers from high computational complexity and low inference efficiency, which severely compromises real-time performance and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose EMCA-CASNet, a novel multi-view 3D perception framework that effectively integrates multi-scale convolution with spatial-channel attention mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce the Enhanced Multi-scale Convolutional Attention Module (EMCAM), which jointly incorporates channel and spatial attention, enhances hierarchical feature representation through multi-scale convolutions with residual connections, and thereby improves object perception across scales. Moreover, we design a lightweight Convolutional Additive Self-Attention (CASAtt) module that replaces standard self-attention by leveraging additive fusion of spatial and channel-wise attention. This enables efficient computation in both sequence and channel dimensions, significantly reduces computational overhead, and preserves effective modeling of feature interactions. Finally, extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for 3D perception."

    "abstract": "The shift towards renewable energy sources has accelerated in recent years, mainly due to global efforts to mitigate climate change effects. However, the growing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the decommissioning of synchronous generators (SGs) have introduced significant challenges to frequency stability during power imbalances. Unlike SGs, conventional IBRs lack inherent inertia and droop characteristics, making the system more vulnerable to rapid frequency deviations and limiting its frequency recovery capability. This work proposes an adaptive coordination scheme for enabling frequency support from grid-following inverters during disturbances. The control scheme emulates virtual inertia, frequency droop, and damping capabilities, with its parameters dynamically adjusted according to the system’s operating conditions, particularly the level of available rotating inertia and the droop support provided by committed SGs. The aim is to enhance frequency performance in scenarios with low rotating inertia and high renewable energy penetration. The methodology is validated through simulations, based on realistic scenarios from the Cyprus power system, demonstrating that the proposed scheme allows the inverter to mimic the behavior of SGs and improve frequency response across various operating conditions."

Efficient, accurate and real-time testing and calibration should be realized in the process of development, calibration and application to ensure the stable and reliable operation of the system. However, the traditional test method relies on a test system composed of multiple professional instruments, which cannot meet today's fast and convenient test requirements. In order to achieve the above goal, this paper proposes a method of amplitude and phase consistency testing based on all-phase FFT analysis. This method improves the testing accuracy of amplitude and phase consistency by using the characteristics of phase invariance and spectrum leakage suppression of all-phase FFT analysis method. In addition, the implementation of this method in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is described in detail. At the same time, this paper also tests each module of the test method through simulation and experiment, and analyzes the test results of important steps, which verifies the feasibility of the method."

    "abstract": "Many studies on trust relationship establishment in Social Networks (SNs) have assumed that the trustworthiness of partners can be identified by participants through interaction. However, in practice, participants not only struggle to discern the trustworthiness of their counterparts but also find it difficult to effectively determine whether the messages they spread are Useful Messages (UMs) or Malicious Messages (MMs). Therefore, designing an efficient information propagation scheme that promotes UMs dissemination while blocking MMs remains a challenging issue in real-world SNs. In this paper, we propose an efficient Trust-based Distributed Incentive (TDI) scheme that aligns with actual SN practices. First, an effective Bidirectional Trust Identification (BTI) approach is proposed to verify the trustworthiness of messages and participants without assuming that interacting participants can evaluate each other's trustworthiness. In BTI, the trustworthiness of participants is evaluated based on their evaluations of trusted participants and reliable messages, while the trust of messages is verified through feedback from trusted participants, laying a foundation for trust information propagation. Then, a Trust-based Message Forwarding (TMF) mechanism is proposed to facilitate the dissemination of trusted messages while blocking the forwarding of low-trust messages. Finally, a Proactive Trust Evaluation (PTE) mechanism is introduced to accelerate and effectively obtain participants' reliable evaluations. Specifically, some UMs are disseminated as Probing Messages (PMs) to accurately evaluate the trustworthiness of participants based on whether they evaluate them truthfully. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the TDI scheme outperforms the existing main schemes in terms of accurately identifying message trust, increasing UMs dissemination, blocking the spread of MMs, and purifying SNs."

However, their predictive accuracy degrades rapidly over time, a phenomenon known as TLE ageing. For power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices relying on precisely scheduled, brief communication links, this degradation leads to missed passes, severely compromising network reliability. This letter rigorously quantifies this critical effect on the Starlink constellation. By analyzing over 2.8 million pass events for 150 satellites observed from four geographically diverse ground stations, the study demonstrates that the missed-pass probability undergoes a critical transition, increasing from less than 1% to over 3% as TLE age increases from 6 to 12 hours. This establishes a critical operational requirement for TLE updates at intervals of 6 hours or less to maintain high-reliability services (e.g., >99%)."

Unlike prior models, these components are jointly optimized to balance sparsity and memory in a coherent training framework. This extended work provides new theoretical analysis of LTSA’s sub-quadratic efficiency and MAM’s convergence behaviour under sparse gating. Comprehensive robustness tests under noise, missing values, and temporal imbalance, along with evaluations on eight diverse datasets from finance, energy, weather, and traffic, demonstrate LTSMiTransformer’s accuracy, generalizability, and compactness. The theoretical proofs, ablation studies, and robustness evaluations included show that the LTSMiTransformer achieves a strong balance between scalability, interpretability, and generalization across diverse datasets.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification plays an important role in achieving trustworthy and reliable learning-based computational imaging. Recent advances in generative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development of uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative model-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on the underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the posterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian neural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction method by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters. Unfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly quantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still persists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an existing generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and introduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian neural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by leveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be easily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and image inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the characteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on top of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent with frequentist principles."

    "abstract": "In many speech recording applications, noise and acoustic echo corrupt the desired speech. Consequently, combined noise reduction (NR) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is required. Generally, a cascade approach is followed, i.e., the AEC and NR are designed in isolation by selecting a separate signal model, separate cost function, and separate solution strategy. The AEC and NR are then cascaded one after the other, not accounting for their interaction. In this paper, an integrated approach is proposed to consider this interaction in a general multi-microphone/ multi- loudspeaker setup. Therefore, a single signal model of either the microphone signal vector or the extended signal vector, obtained by stacking microphone and loudspeaker signals, is selected, a single mean squared error cost function is formulated, and a common solution strategy is used. Using this microphone signal model, a multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) is derived. Using the extended signal model, it is shown that an extended MWF (MWF<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub>) can be derived, and several equivalent expressions can be found, which are nevertheless shown to be interpretable as cascade algorithms. Specifically, the MWF<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub> is shown to be equivalent to algorithms where the AEC precedes the NR (AEC-NR), the NR precedes the AEC (NR-AEC), and the extended NR (NR<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub>) precedes the AEC and post-filter (PF) (NR<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub>-AEC-PF). Under rank-deficiency conditions the MWF<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ext</sub> is non-unique.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributionally robust coordinated road-waterway hydrogen transport strategy to enhance the utilization of remote renewable energy sources (RESs) for low-carbon energy supply in cities. In this strategy, solid-state hydrogen storage serves as an intermediary to transport RESs from remote regions to meet the energy demand of urban hydrogen energy storage systems (HESSs). Moreover, a renewable-to-hydrogen production control method that integrates dynamic programming is developed to suppress the output ripple of conventional two-stage single-phase inverters, enhancing both the energy conversion efficiency and the production rate of green hydrogen for stable shipping transportation. A road-waterway hydrogen distribution routing and scheduling model is developed to guarantee a precise spatio-temporal match between hydrogen supply and demand of HESSs. The coordinated road-waterway hydrogen transport optimization problem is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization problem to cope with uncertainties of hydrogen demands. Comparative results have validated the superior performance of the proposed strategy in enhancing remote RES accommodation and improving the stability of low-carbon energy supply for cities."

    "abstract": "Ophthalmic diseases are a major contributor of blindness and visual impairment globally. Effective treatment and halting the progression of the disease depend on an early and precise diagnosis. Recent developments in Deep Learning (DL) have shown enormous promise for automated multi-label classification of ophthalmic diseases using retinal images. This work provides a thorough analysis of 20 research studies published between 2022 and 2025 that focus on DL-based multi-label diagnostic models for retinal image analysis. The reviewed works cover a variety of eye conditions such diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and other abnormalities of the retina. Neural networks with convolutions (CNNs), attention-based models, and other DL architectures and hybrid networks, are discussed in terms of their methodology, performance metrics, and clinical applicability. The review highlights the challenges faced in multi-label classification, such as data scarcity, class imbalance, and model interpretability, and discusses strategies employed to address these issues. By synthesizing recent advancements, this paper provides insights into the potential of DL to improve diagnostic accuracy, assist ophthalmologists in decision-making, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes."

In noisy environments, traditional compression methods often lose details during the process, resulting in poor image recovery. To address this issue, this paper proposes an image compression and transmission system based on Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (AC-GAN). The system compresses images into low-dimensional feature vectors and transmits them through noisy channels, then reconstructs the images at the receiver using AC-GAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains high recovery quality even under a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of −10 dB, proving its strong noise resistance in challenging environments. The proposed approach provides an effective solution for image transmission in high-noise scenarios."

The size of the ground plane usually scales in the tens of wavelengths, which represents a heavy burden in terms of computational resources. In this paper we apply the Method of Moments (MoM) combined with a Calderón preconditioner. We ensure the regularity of the refined mesh by using an initial rectangular mesh with rooftop basis functions. The regularity of the refined mesh allows for the application of the Calderón preconditioner in an iterative solver which exhibits linear and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N \\log N$</tex> complexities regarding memory and matrix-vector multiplication, respectively. These complexities are enabled by the Toeplitz-Block BlockToeplitz (TBBT) structure of the MoM matrices which allows for the use of the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the matrix-vector multiplications. The operations are carried out at the level of the half basis function in order to include the half basis functions that the preconditioner requires on the edges of open structures. An additional simple algebraic multiplication allows to modify the mesh in order to simulate ground planes with arbitrary contours."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of intelligent manufacturing, precise prediction of tool life is crucial for ensuring machining accuracy and efficiency. Aiming at the problem that traditional methods have limited accuracy in tool remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, this paper proposes an algorithm model integrating time-domain and frequency-domain features with a TCN-Informer cascade for tool RUL prediction. First, eight time-domain features (such as mean and standard deviation) and four frequency-domain features (such as amplitude spectrum mean and variance) are extracted from the PHM tool dataset. Features with a Spearman correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 with the maximum tool wear are screened through Spearman correlation analysis to construct an input dataset with high representational capability. Second, the causal convolution and dilated convolution of TCN are used to capture the local temporal dependencies and long-distance correlations of signals. Combined with the sparse self-attention mechanism of Informer to solve the computational complexity problem in long-sequence processing, it realizes global modeling of the dynamic features of tool wear. Experimental results show that on the C1, C4, and C6 tool datasets, the coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) of the model exceeds 0.997, and the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are significantly lower than comparative methods such as CNN-LSTM and Informer, demonstrating remarkable advantages in prediction accuracy and generalization ability. This method provides great help for tool health management. It can assist in formulating scientific tool replacement strategies by monitoring feature changes in real time, which is of great significance for improving machining efficiency and accuracy. In future research, multimodal data fusion and lightweight model design can be further explored to adapt to the needs of complex industrial scenarios."

Although deep learning-based sequence-to-point (Seq2Point) models are becoming increasingly popular, no unified framework exists for fair and reproducible evaluation across datasets and appliance types. We address this by developing a modular bench-marking pipeline, incorporating standardised data pre-processing and consistent training and evaluation procedures. The toolkit supports three major public datasets (UKDALE, REFIT, ECO) and multiple Seq2Point variants. In addition, we propose a novel architecture, Seq2Point Balanced. It integrates a variety of regularisation techniques and architectural simplifications to significantly reduce the parameter count by 94% (1.8 million vs. 30 million), whilst improving robustness and generalisation. Experiments show that Seq2Point Balanced achieves competitive and often superior performance, particularly in noisy and cross-domain scenarios. The model demonstrates strong fine-tuning capabilities. The toolkit is publicly released to support reproducibility at: https://github.com/ymahajan1612/seq2point-update."

The polarization switching discussed here involves the reflection of linearly polarized incoming waves, where the reflected waves can be switched between linear polarization and circular polarization. The simple principle underlying the design of RES for polarization switching lies in the upper layer of the unit cell structure, where three switches integrated into the diagonal slot act as perturbation activators and eliminators. In OFF-state condition, the perturbation function is active, producing circularly polarized reflected waves. While in ON-state condition, the perturbation function is eliminated, resulting in linearly polarized reflected waves. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to configure RES for polarization switching across three frequency bands. In addition, experimental verification conducted in the microwave band demonstrates agreement between simulation and measurement."

Through simulation experiments, the performance of the three algorithms in key indicators such as service rate, waiting time, total driving distance, and system efficiency is compared.

At the same time, falling groundwater levels endanger long-term water security. Existing forecasting methods do not have the accuracy and scalability needed for effective management. This research work introduces a framework that uses real-time sensing and data-driven analytics to improve water resource monitoring and prediction. Key water quality parameters are continuously measured with embedded Wireless Sensor Networks. The data is sent to a centralized cloud interface for visualisation and timely alerts. Meanwhile, historical groundwater level data is analysed using supervised machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. This analysis helps identify trends over time and forecast future availability. The proposed method shows high accuracy in both detecting anomalies and predictive modelling.

However, constructing realistic cable testing platforms is challenging due to multiple voltage levels, long distances, and high costs. This results in insufficient hands-on training for personnel and a lack of calibration standards for testing instruments. This paper proposes a physical simulation method for cable broadband impedance based on LC cascade circuits: Following DL/T 838 and GB/T 3956 standards, the distributed parameters per unit length for 10kV to 500kV cables (including the main body, joints, and terminals) are calculated. Through discrete LC units and cascading, the broadband impedance of long-distance cables is reproduced. Taking a 500kV/50km XLPE cable as an example, 193 LC units (L=38.681μH, C=40.296nF) can simulate the 10kHz to 400kHz frequency band, with an equivalent bandwidth of 1.466kHz. The actual simulation device has been tested and proven to be feasible. The standardized laboratory platform established through this method supports talent training and instrument calibration, addressing core bottlenecks in operations and maintenance."

This paper benchmarks three neural training approaches for the DCOPF problem: a) a supervised approach, b) a hybrid physics-informed approach, and c) a fully unsupervised, physics-informed approach. All three approaches are evaluated under a unified pipeline across three IEEE test cases (case5, case57, case300), using consistent architectures, datasets, and metrics. Results show that the supervised approach offers good optimality but suffers from constraint violations. The unsupervised approach delivers relatively good feasibility but suffers in terms of optimality. The hybrid approach offers the most balanced trade-off between optimality and feasibility, making it a practical option."

It also supports the implementation of a newly introduced four-tariff system, derived from Croatia’s existing dual-tariff model, while incorporating current feed-in compensation schemes. The methodology is validated through twelve case studies across two households, utilizing hourly load and PV generation data, battery parameters, and tariff structures. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assesses the impact of investment costs, electricity tariffs, and feed-in compensation rates on the return on investment (ROI) for BESS, focusing on Case study 5."

    "abstract": "Professional visualization design has become an increasingly important area of inquiry, yet much of the field’s discourse remains anchored in researcher-centered contexts. Studies of design practice often focus on individual designers’ decisions and reflections, offering limited insight into the collaborative and systemic dimensions of professional work. In this paper, we propose a systems-level reframing of design judgment grounded in the coordination and adaptation that sustain progress amid uncertainty, constraint, and misalignment. Drawing on sustained engagement across multiple empirical studies—including ethnographic observation of design teams and qualitative studies of individual practitioners—we identify recurring episodes in which coherence was preserved not by selecting an optimal option, but by repairing alignment, adjusting plans, and reframing goals. We interpret these dynamics through the lens of Joint Cognitive Systems, which provide tools for analyzing how judgment emerges as a distributed capacity within sociotechnical activity. This perspective surfaces often-invisible work in visualization design and offers researchers a new conceptual vocabulary for studying how design activity is sustained in practice."

This paper presents a proposed machine learning system controlling machine utilization on an electrical power base, using engineered long-term and statistical predictors along with a gradient boosting model to forecast predictable electrical power use with high resolution (10 minutes). The approach combines the attributes of calendar and roll statistics aggregates so that the model can adequately derive cyclical demand and short-run consumption dynamics. In contrast to time series or deep learning models, the proposed approach has interpretability, computational efficiency, and deployment preparedness as their priority. The model shows a high predictive accuracy in several metrics such as an R 2 of 0.88 and RMSE which is low thus showing that the model is effective at different load conditions. The findings point to the real-life relevance of interpretable, data-driven prediction systems in assisting real-time decision-making, demand response policies, and energy optimization in current urban infrastructures."

    "abstract": "Tissue-mimicking phantoms are essential tools in the development of new biomedical equipment, enabling testing of new technologies in a controlled environment. A good tissuemimicking phantom should be low-cost, should not include toxic components and should have stable properties over time. An ideal phantom should also mimic multiple properties of the tissues simultaneously. This paper focuses on phantoms emulating both the dielectric and mechanical properties of human tissues, particularly of the breast. Specifically, a low-cost strategy based on the use of sunflower oil is investigated to preserve both dielectric and mechanical properties of phantoms (previously proposed by the authors to mimic the characteristics of the breast) over ten days. These phantoms, based on mixtures of water, sunflower seed oil, dish detergent, and gelatin, have already demonstrated the best technique for preserving dielectric properties for up to ten days, through complete oil immersion. In this work, oil preservation is further analyzed, particularly for maintaining the mechanical properties of the phantoms. Mechanical properties (stress-strain curves from which Young's modulus was calculated) of different samples emulating the properties of neoplastic and low-density healthy tissue were measured. Results show that oil is a cost-effective and safe candidate for preserving both the dielectric and mechanical properties of tissue-mimicking phantoms."

Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to detect and locate the rail insulation defects of DC traction power supply system, a novel rail insulation defect detection method based on the FFC-Swin-Transformer is proposed. By establishing a four-layer \"catenary-rail-SCCN-earth\" equivalent circuit model and integrating multi-train operation conditions, a rail potential dataset is efficiently generated via parallel computing. Time-domain signals of rail potential are converted to frequency-domain features using Fourier transform, and the fused time-frequency information is fed into an improved FFC-Swin-Transformer network to achieve accurate detection of rail insulation states. Experimental results show that after training on 22496 sample groups, the model achieves a test accuracy of 82.95%, effectively identifying section insulation defects and exhibiting promising engineering application potential."

Despite its advantages, research into the optimal deployment of distributed applications across fluid scenarios remains scarce, and existing centralized frameworks cannot exploit emerging AI-native features nor model realistic multi-domain deployment scenarios. This paper presents an innovative provider-based architecture for the optimal orchestration of distributed AI services in fluid environments under 6G network capabilities. The proposed hybrid solution includes robust and scalable decentralized orchestration for the placement of cross-provider workloads without a central broker, as well as leveraging autonomous decision-making devices through distributed task offloading techniques. The proposal was tailored to a Decentralized Federated Learning deployment, serving as a use case in settings with strict privacy and security requirements. This approach was adopted to illustrate the viability of the proposal by deploying large distributed AI services in 6G-like networks."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at processing heterogeneous graph data and are widely applied in critical domains. In HGNN inference, the neighbor aggregation stage is the primary performance determinant, yet it suffers from two major sources of memory inefficiency. First, the commonly adopted per-semantic execution paradigm stores intermediate aggregation results for each semantic prior to semantic fusion, causing substantial memory expansion. Second, the aggregation process incurs extensive redundant memory accesses, including repeated loading of target vertex features across semantics and repeated accesses to shared neighbors due to crosssemantic neighborhood overlap. These inefficiencies severely limit scalability and reduce HGNN inference performance. In this work, we first propose a semantics-complete execution paradigm from a vertex perspective that eliminates per-semantic intermediate storage and redundant target vertex accesses. Building on this paradigm, we design TVL-HGNN, a reconfigurable hardware accelerator optimized for efficient aggregation. In addition, we introduce a vertex grouping technique based on crosssemantic neighborhood overlap, with hardware implementation, to reduce redundant accesses to shared neighbors. Experimental results demonstrate that TVL-HGNN achieves average speedups of 7.85× and 1.41× over the NVIDIA A100 GPU and the state-of-the-art HGNN accelerator HiHGNN, respectively, while reducing energy consumption by 98.79 % and 32.61 %."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and deadliest cancers worldwide, largely due to its asymptomatic development and difficulty in early detection. Accurate classification of liver tumors as benign or malignant is critical for selecting appropriate therapy and determining prognosis. Computed Tomography (CT) is widely used for liver tumor detection because it generates high-resolution cross-sectional anatomical images. However, manual classification still poses challenges due to inter-observer disagreement and the complex morphology of tumors. In this paper, we propose a novel classification method based on the Prognostic Assimilate Learning Classifier (PALC), a robust feature-based approach that enhances diagnostic accuracy while reducing computational cost. The proposed framework consists of four main stages: Image pre-processing using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise, Tumor region segmentation using the Linear Iterative Clustering Algorithm (LICA), Texture feature extraction using a subspace method and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors, Final classification using the proposed PALC model. Validation was conducted on a set of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ C T}$</tex> images annotated by a panel of clinical experts using experimental validation. The PALC model demonstrated strong generalization performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 97.5%, precision of 96.8%, recall of 97.2%, and a very low false classification rate of 1.4%. The average processing time of 13.3 ms per image on the test set suggests that the proposed method is suitable for real-time clinical application. Comparative analysis with traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further confirms the efficiency and scalability of the PALC model. Overall, the proposed approach offers a practical and reliable tool for automatic liver cancer classification in biomedical imaging systems."

    "abstract": "Industrial control systems are the backbone of critical infrastructure, yet they are increasingly becoming targets of sophisticated cyberattacks. AI-based threat detection systems are a promising approach, but their performance often degrades significantly in real-world operational environments due to data drift, particularly covariate shift. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a comprehensive and adaptable threat detection framework. The novelty of the method lies in two main points: (1) a hybrid feature selection technique called CSFS (Covariate Shift Adaptation and SHAP-powered Feature Selection), which combines adaptability to data distribution changes and the interpretability of SHAP to select the most stable and effective features; and (2) a robust ensemble architecture based on weighted voting of multiple AI models to maximize accuracy and enhance resilience against adversarial attacks. The proposed framework has been tested thoroughly using two key datasets for industrial networks: Modbus/TCP and IEC 60870-5-104. The results show that our method not only significantly improves detection accuracy but also maintains stable performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods when faced with changes in the network environment."

    "abstract": "The radio telescopes with the largest collecting areas, the Arecibo (no longer operational) and FAST telescopes, have a spherical main reflector, mainly because of its ease of construction and its inherent wide-angle beam scanning capability in terms of the number of beam-widths scanned, while maintaining the integrity of the radiation pattern. The inherent spherical aberration, however, causes considerable performance degradation. These telescopes therefore use different methods to compensate for the spherical aberration, but they both require complex and expensive (moving) mechanical components. This article extends to large spherical reflectors a method to compensate for the spherical aberration based on the use of sub-reflectarrays. A microstrip reflectarray is a planar, inexpensive, passive device with unique capabilities of controlling reflection phases. By exploiting this property, a reflectarray can be employed as an auxiliary phase corrector, and the phase errors caused by spherical aberration can be compensated. In this article we discuss and simulate the operation of a sub-reflectarray on an Arecibo-like antenna at X-band, and then show that great performance improvement can be achieved for both no scan and moderate electronic scan cases."

We compare Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers that are evaluated on actual medical records and trained on synthetic data. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests are used to evaluate privacy, accuracy and ROC-AUC are used to examine usefulness, and classifiers that can distinguish between actual and synthetic data are used to investigate detectability. According to experimental data, RF outperformed KNN in the synthetic-to-real transfer task, achieving an accuracy of around 0.79 and a ROC-AUC of 0.86, while KNN acquired an accuracy of approximately 0.74 and a ROC-AUC of 0.80. Tests of detectability showed that the ability to differentiate between actual and synthetic data was still only moderately successful (RF accuracy ~0.83, KNN accuracy ~0.78), suggesting a trade-off between privacy and utility. These results show that CTGAN-generated synthetic data can facilitate trustworthy machine learning in the medical field, with RF providing more robustness than KNN."

The miniature TEM cell is directly covered on the IC of the working printed circuit board (PCB) for EMC testing. The design of the measuring device is described in detail, and whose electromagnetic performances are analyzed by numerical method.

Core contributions include: (1) a knowledge-data dual-driven multi-level feature engineering approach embedding physical knowledge into the feature space, enhancing model robustness and interpretability; (2) a progressive transfer strategy based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), guiding knowledge transfer sequence by quantifying domain similarity to effectively avoid negative transfer; (3) A unique feature mapping mechanism transforming high-dimensional engineered features into six-dimensional physical features with explicit physical meaning, achieving transparency in model decision-making. Through rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation, this framework elevated the average diagnostic accuracy across diverse operating conditions from 71.94% to 96.24%, while significantly reducing performance fluctuations. This demonstrates its efficacy, generalisation capability, and interpretability within complex scenarios."

The reasonable adoption of international standards requires basic understanding of network impedance from 2 kHz to 9 kHz in Japan. This paper presents the field study of network impedance in Japan. In this study, the network impedance seen from the 100 V socket at 58 sites in service areas of seven distribution system operators (DSOs) was measured.

    "abstract": "Regional energy planning is pivotal for advancing both national and EU climate objectives, particularly amidst escalating climate challenges and the urgent need for a sustainable energy transition. Energy efficiency is central to achieving the EU's climate ambition which is reaffirmed in the recently revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EU/2023/1791). The directive strengthens the legislative framework for the application of the “Energy Efficiency First” (EE1st) principle, which mandates that cost-effective energy efficiency measures should be prioritized over supply-side investments in energy generation and infrastructure. Despite its policy prominence, embedding the EE1st principle into regional and local planning remains complex. Key challenges include amongst others: lack of awareness and understanding, and lack of technical knowledge and competence. To support this policy-to-practice transition, the REGIO1st project - co-funded by the LIFE Programme - has developed the REGIO1st Planning Framework and accompanying tools to assist regions in aligning their energy strategies with the EE1st principle. Cornerstone to this framework is the Regio1st Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool. This tool assists planners in evaluating and prioritizing energy interventions using a transparent, evidence-based methodology grounded in environmental, technical, economic, and social criteria. It also facilitates structured stakeholder feedback, enhancing legitimacy and acceptance of energy strategies. Currently being piloted in six European regions, the REGIO1st Framework is tailored to accommodate diverse regional conditions and planning cultures. This paper presents the conceptual foundations and methodological design of the REGIO1st MCDA tool, exploring its role in facilitating the application of the EE1st principle within a participatory decision-making context. Early insights from pilot implementation are shared, highlighting practical benefits, encountered barriers, and recommendations for wider adoption and refinement."

    "abstract": "The contribution at hand presents a novel, selective dynamic sampling-based control strategy for matrix headlights to enhance the camera object detection in automated driving systems. The approach is based on continuously sampling the illuminated environment with different luminous intensity distributions created by the matrix headlights. By this, the neural network for camera object detection identifies the most suitable illumination for the current situation to detect traffic objects optimally. The approach is applicable in real-time in dynamic environments, avoiding flickering for human road users and working without prior knowledge of the environment or the objects. The hardware requirements are limited to cameras and matrix headlights, allowing for widespread use. The approach is evaluated across diverse dynamic scenarios, generating 4,130 samples for robust statistical analysis. The results in the simulation show that the novel approach outperforms human-focused luminous intensity distributions with a mean average precision of 0.88 compared to human-focused luminous intensity distributions like low beam, with only a mean average precision of 0.31. In challenging situations, e.g., larger distances to the objects, the approach improves the mean average precision by 37.5% compared to the best-scoring classic luminous intensity distribution high beam. Even when the ego vehicle is driving, the novel approach achieves a mean average precision of between 0.75 and 0.85, outperforming all other luminous intensity distributions and significantly increasing the safety of automated vehicles."

The proposed work here recommends a hybrid architecture of deep learning model with machine learning based classifiers to enhance emotion classification using the FER2013 dataset of 48×48 grayscale face images for seven emotions. Extensive preprocessing operations such as normalization, CLAHE-based contrast stretching, and data augmentation are carried out, followed by class balancing using Random Oversampling and SMOTE. A deep CNN is trained to acquire deep features, and the features from its dense layer are again processed with SelectKBest for reducing the dimensions. These characteristics are subsequently ensembled through machine learning based classifiers like Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM for classification pupose. Experimental testing reveals that the hybrid CNN + XGBoost model delivers better performance, with accuracy of 72.96% for oversampling on training data only and 86.69% for oversampling on the entire dataset. Macro-averaged precision of 0.7446, recall of 0.7106, and F1-score of 0.7243 are also enhanced to 0.8670, 0.8669, and 0.8667, respectively. These results show that a hybrid deep learning-ensemble method combined with proper management of class imbalance has the ability to greatly enhance the robustness of FER systems and provides very powerful potential for real-world emotion-aware applications."

    "abstract": "Crop health and weed infestation are essential issues in contemporary agriculture as they affect yield, cost and sustainability. Conventional forms of weed detection and growth measurement are laborious, prone to errors and they cannot offer timely interventions. Current automated systems, despite their effectiveness with certain conditions, tend to be scaled down in size, have reduced accuracy in a wide range of environments and are not integrated with crop monitoring. To fill these research gaps, this paper introduces a new drone-based precision agriculture system integrating high-resolution images, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect weeds, the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess crop health, and the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to make growth predictions. The suggested system had a weed detection accuracy of 92 percent with a F1-score of 0.92 and a stable prediction of NDVI based growth with a mean absolute error of 0.03. Web interface-based real-time visualization also provided improved decision-making to farmers. This is because of the enhanced efficiency, reliability and sustainability in utilizing the weed detection and growth monitoring system as a single system resulting in minimizing herbicide usage and resource optimization in precision farming."

    "abstract": "Current ground-based observation systems face significant challenges in detecting space debris and meteoroids smaller than 10 cm. Hypervelocity impacts (HVIs) of these small objects at relative speeds ranging of 1–1 5 km/s for debris and 11-73 km/s for meteoroids, pose serious risks to spacecraft [1]. These collisions involve complex phase transitions and ionization processes that convert substantial amounts of kinetic energy into heat and electromagnetic radiation. To investigate these effects, we performed numerical simulations of hypervelocity collisions and the subsequent evolution of the plasma-fragments clouds generated by the collisions. Our results indicate that HVIs generate rapidly evolving plasma clouds that emit nonthermal electromagnetic radiation across a broad spectrum with characteristics that vary based on the impact velocity and the material composition of both the projectile and the target. The high-temperature droplets and solid fragments generated by the collisions emit thermal radiation in infrared and optical bands. Our link budget analyses suggest that both the thermal and non-thermal emissions from HVIs can be leveraged for remote, ground-based, detection and characterization of small, otherwise untrackable, space debris and meteoroids."

Evaluating clinical and tissue samples are quite labor intensive and costly and runs the risk of human error. In this paper, to examine an Automated Skin Cancer Detection Using Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) and describe in detail the processes and methodologies employed, as well as classification and data pre-processing in the context of RBFNs, including the various stages of feature extraction, segmentation, and classification. In the RBF preprocessing steps, data is normalized and noise is removed using RBMs, and reduced in dimensions. During feature extraction, the lesion's irregularity, coloration, and diameter were analyzed. A Fuzzy Clustering Segmentation method improves accuracy to a great extent by differentiating lesions from the skin that covers them. RBFN classification is based on the extracted features, and this method has proven most effective in dealing with complex, nonlinear classification problems, theorized by many to problematic to solve. Out of a total of 4500 dermoscopic images, the identified technique, when evaluated, surpassed conventional classifiers such as Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with an accuracy of 92.7%."

However, its rapid adoption, particularly in allowing custom server and tool development, introduces significant security vulnerabilities, with command injection emerging as a dominant threat, accounting for 43% of observed vulnerabilities in popular MCP servers. While existing research has highlighted these dangers, focused investigation into their detection and mitigation, specifically within the MCP environment, remains limited. This research addresses this gap by evaluating the performance of five transformer-based models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and ELECTRA, for detecting command injection attacks in MCP environments. The dataset for this study was curated from real-world MCP server usage, public prompt injection datasets, and custom-created examples specifically designed to cover diverse MCP-specific command injection attack vectors. Our findings found that transformer-based models demonstrate an exceptional performance against command injection attacks, with all evaluated models achieving validation accuracy exceeding 98.8%. Among these models, DistilBERT emerged as the highest performing model, achieving 99.92% validation and test accuracy. By integrating real-world MCP usage with a broad spectrum of targeted attack vectors, the dataset established a robust foundation for training models capable of effectively mitigating command injection threats within the MCP ecosystem."

A dynamic microgrid model is developed, incorporating grid-forming primary controls (droop and virtual synchronous generator (VSG)) and FRT mechanisms (current magnitude saturation (CMS) and virtual impedance (VI)). The study compares these control methods under symmetrical faults, highlighting their impact on system stability, fault recovery, and power sharing.

Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink illustrate that loads with the same power but different characteristics can significantly affect fault recovery performance, as can the current limitation method used in the GFL. Constant PQ loads exhibit negative impedance behavior, which can lead to instability if not properly managed. The results also show that the hybrid current limiting method in the GFM demonstrates better performance across varying load conditions."

The orchestration platform's ease of use and impressive orchestration capabilities have driven its widespread adoption in the machine learning domain for inferencing and training.

Its inefficient CPU resource utilization has led to high power consumption during AI inferencing [1]. This paper conducts research on the energy efficiency of Kubernetes in the context of machine learning and also proposes a dynamic framework that aims at reducing the power consumption of the inferencing workload by adjusting the CPU allocation in real-time on an AMD cluster. The framework configures the containers to their most optimal CPU allocation settings on the Kubernetes cluster while maintaining the workloads latency thresholds defined by the service level agreement. We describe a holistic solution that can be leveraged by all the inferencing workloads using Kubernetes, taking into account the inferencing performance and its power consumption. We discuss the results of a tree-based XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) inferencing workload where the power consumption was reduced by 75 % as compared to the default settings for the SLA used in this research. We show that by introducing a dynamic CPU-allocation framework, we can see significant improvements in the power consumption for machine learning inferencing workloads on Kubernetes clusters without substantially compromising inferencing performance. This research also highlights that Kubernetes potential is not just limited to container orchestration but is capable of dynamically optimizing energy usage in cloud-native AI applications. This research contributes to the growing need for more sustainable and greener AI deployments, especially in the age of generative AI."

    "abstract": "Driver drowsiness and alcohol impairment are leading causes of road accidents globally, necessitating reliable, non-intrusive detection systems. This study develops a real-time, computer vision-based application to identify signs of driver impairment by analyzing facial features. The system utilizes the Dlib library to detect 68 facial landmarks and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to monitor eye-blinking patterns. A threshold of 0.25 is used to classify the driver's state as “Alert” or “Drowsy/Drunk.” Implemented with OpenCV and a Tkinter graphical interface, the solution processes webcam feeds or static images efficiently. Results demonstrate high performance, with the system achieving 92.4% accuracy, 94.6% recall, and an average processing speed of 50–70 ms per frame, proving its viability for real-time use. The study confirms that a lightweight, geometric-feature-based approach can offer a cost-effective and accessible alternative to computationally intensive deep learning models. This work provides a practical foundation for enhancing driver safety and can be deployed on standard hardware, making it particularly relevant for broad adoption and future integration with additional modalities like yawning detection."

    "abstract": "Modern software systems deployed in safety- critical and real-time environments demand continuous operation and resilience to unforeseen faults. Traditional fault-handling mechanisms rely on reactive, rule-based strategies and manual debugging, which are insufficient for dynamic, autonomous systems. Inspired by biological repair mechanisms, this study proposes a self-healing software architecture capable of autonomous fault detection, diagnosis, and patching at runtime. The primary objective of this research is to design and evaluate a biologically inspired, AI-driven framework that performs real-time software fault recovery with minimal human intervention. The proposed architecture integrates a transformer-based fault localization engine with a neural patch synthesis model trained on the ManySStuBs4J dataset. Runtime fault detection and control are handled through a modular feedback mechanism that ensures safe patch deployment and rollback. Evaluation is conducted using the Defects4J and ManySStuBs4J datasets across 395 real-world bugs and over 150,000 bug-fix pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a fault localization accuracy of 88.6%, patch generation success rate of 74.2%, and patch correctness rate of 68.3%, while maintaining a mean patch generation latency of 310.4ms —substantially outperforming state-of-the- art baselines including GenProg, DeepFix, and RLRepair. This architecture advances the state of autonomous software repair by combining biological principles with machine learning, enabling scalable, low-latency, and deployable self-healing capabilities for mission-critical applications."

    "abstract": "In modern agriculture, high crop yields and food security depend on early and accurate identification of plant diseases. Deep learning (DL) models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have successfully classified plant disease using leaf images. Classical models are adequate for small-scale applications but inefficient for large-scale applications because of their high processing requirements and difficulty in handling highdimensional data. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) by leveraging the Cirq library to introduce quantum circuit simulation. The QCNN model is trained on the Kaggle coffee plant dataset and JMuBEN Mendeley. Quantum Fourier transforms (QFT) are used to preprocess the input images for enhanced quality and to find regions of interest (ROI) for disease lesions. The empirical results prove that the QCNN has drastically improved the model's performance in each phase of the epoch when compared with the traditional CNN model. In the training phase, the QCNN accomplished 96.98 %, whereas the CNN achieved 88.95 % for 150 epochs. Similarly, an effective performance is accomplished during the testing phase by QCNN with 95.89% in comparison with the CNN performance of 85.77 %. Hence, this work emphasizes the power of QCNN in faster training and analytical capabilities using entanglement and superposition in the quantum domain."

Both solution approaches not only preserve the information privacy of T&D planners but also guarantee finite convergence to optimality. Limited information on the interface nodes connecting the T&D systems is exchanged which allows decomposing the problem into independent subproblems for each T&D planner. The effectiveness of both algorithms is assessed using a 36-node test system, showing a reasonable trade-off between solution quality and computation times for a practical setting."

The estimation method utilizes numerical data of the direct geometric optical ray (DGO) and reflected geometric optical ray (RGO) series, which comprise the backward transient scattering waves when a line source and an observation point are situated at different positions. The scatterer information dealt with in this study is the relative permittivity and thickness of a coating medium layer, in addition to the outer radius of the coated cylinder. The estimation formulas employed in this estimation method are derived using the time-domain Fourier transform method (TD-FTM) and the amplitude intensity ratios (AIRs), defined as the ratio of the peaks of adjacent backward transient scattering waves. The estimates are obtained by substituting the numerical data of the response waveforms into the estimation formulas and performing iterative calculations. The discussion in this study focuses on the noise tolerance of the estimation method by adding noise to the signal data of the response waveforms. It is clarified that the noise tolerance of the estimation method employing TD-FTM and AIRs is equivalent to that of the conventional method, namely the estimation method using the time-domain saddle-point technique (TD-SPT) and AIRs."

    "abstract": "The stable operation of the urban rail transit CBTC system is of great significance to urban transportation, and the performance of the distributed communication algorithm of its simulation test platform is the key. The existing algorithms have deficiencies in real-time performance and reliability, which affect the accuracy and efficiency of the test. To this end, this paper proposes an ADRRO algorithm based on adaptive dynamic routing and redundant data optimization. The algorithm uses real-time network status monitoring to dynamically plan routing paths and avoid congested links. At the same time, it uses data fingerprint technology to accurately identify and optimize redundant data transmission. In the simulation environment built by NS-3, different network scales, loads and topologies are set for comparative testing. The results show that compared with the original algorithm, the ADRRO algorithm reduces the average data transmission delay from 450 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds, a decrease of 33.3 %; the packet loss rate is reduced from 7 % to 4 %, a decrease of 42.9 %; the network throughput is increased from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 2 M b p s}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 8 M b p s}$</tex>, an increase of 50 %. This shows that the ADRRO algorithm effectively improves the platform communication performance, builds a solid technical support for the research and development, testing and verification of the CBTC system, and effectively promotes the safe and efficient development of urban rail transit. In the future, in-depth research can be conducted from the perspectives of integrating emerging network technologies, optimizing complex environment performance, and enhancing hardware compatibility."

This setup offers continuous, verified measurements of sediment buildup. The data is processed and sent via MQTT to a ThingSpeak cloud dashboard for real-time viewing and archived trend analysis. When thresholds are breached, automated email alerts are triggered through IFTTT. A scaled-tank prototype and repeated lab tests validated this approach: the depth and pressure signals showed strong complementary behavior (correlation <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{r} \\approx$</tex> -0.92).

Network traffic traces are first fetched from the IoT-23 and Edge-IIoT datasets. Preprocessing through Confidence Partitioning Sampling Filtering (CPSF) is accomplished to remove noise, balance attacks, and scale the dataset to improve learning. The Gooseneck Barnacle Optimization Algorithm (GBOA) is utilized for the selection of discriminative network traffic features, while being computationally light. For the detection of cyber-attacks, the Unsupervised Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (UCCGAN) is implemented with adversarial learning for pinpointing subtle attacks. Hyperparameters are further tuned with Termite Life Cycle Optimization (TLCO) to better improve model accuracy and stability. Experimental evaluation evinces an increment in attack detection accuracy by 17.85%, 23.41%, and 29.74% against state-of-the-art competitors. The deployment of the middleware showcases an enhancement of CPU use by only 2.1%, with memory usage increasing to 0.42 GB, to maintain resource efficiency.

In particular, some results on the optimization of the unit cell used to discretize the surface are presented: a simplified model is adopted for its characterization, and the presence of a glass layer is introduced to take into account the effects eventually introduced by the window on the surface performance. Preliminary results confirm that the adopted multi-objective optimization strategy allows to strongly improve the unit cell features, and therefore that of the entire surface."

    "abstract": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for chatbot applications is currently widespread. The availability of various models with specific characteristics tailored to different needs has made these models increasingly popular. However, challenges remain, particularly the high computational resource requirements, such as the need for a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This has led to the need for optimization through emerging technologies, one of which is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG allows users to avoid resource-intensive fine-tuning processes. Several RAG methods are already in use, such as Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS), Weaviate, Elasticsearch, Qdrant, etc., but the implementation techniques vary widely and still require experimentation to achieve optimal performance while minimizing computational demands. This is especially important considering that chatbots are often integrated into web servers, which are typically focused on web programming rather than artificial intelligence (AI). This study evaluates several chatbot schemes utilizing RAG with a FAISS index for a Question and Answer (Q/A)-based chatbot. The model used is a lightweight one with minimal GPU requirements, namely Gemma:2b-Instruct. The tested schemes include: (i) a single FAISS index, (ii) a single FAISS index with special chunking, (iii) two FAISS indices handling Q/A and non-Q/A in a serial manner, and (iv) two FAISS indices handling Q/A and non-Q/A in parallel. Experimental results show that using special chunking to handle Q/A improves accuracy, and the use of two FAISS indices in parallel minimizes the dominance of the Q/A index over the non-Q/A index."

Unlike traditional methods, Scigent operates in open-ended scenarios, resolving entities and relationships in real-time. Alongside this, we present Scigent-QA, a benchmark built on DBLP and ORKG knowledge graphs, to evaluate end-to-end question-answering systems. This benchmark provides a comprehensive testbed for assessing real-world applicability and robustness. Additionally, we release a full pipeline for constructing and continuously updating scientific knowledge graphs, ensuring the system remains current with emerging publications. This work advances knowledge-driven AI, enabling robust and scalable solutions for complex scientific queries. Empirical results demonstrate that Scigent, when used with popular large language models, achieves up to 65 % accuracy on the end-to-end evaluation of Scigent-QA, proving its practicality for real-world applications."

However, image reconstruction remains challenging under sparse or noisy sampling conditions, especially for frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) systems. Conventional physics-based algorithms often rely on strong prior assumptions and exhibit limited performance in such scenarios. Meanwhile, most deep learning approaches are supervised and designed primarily for 2D reconstruction tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose mmDecoder, an unsupervised neural network for 3D SAR image reconstruction that incorporates physical priors within a decoder-only architecture. The model learns directly from raw echo signals without ground truth labels and employs L1 regularization for structural sparsity, thereby improving reconstruction quality. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that mmDecoder outperforms both traditional methods and untrained neural networks under low sampling rates, demonstrating its robustness and practical potential for real-world radar imaging applications."

Specifically, we introduce a consensus-aware module that embeds diverse observations into a unified consensus representation to enable coordination under decentralized execution. Furthermore, the CAMP framework integrates a dynamic inference module that leverages environmental features to predict dynamic changes in the environment, thereby facilitating foresighted decision-making. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CAMP framework improves task completion throughput by at least 15% within the same time period compared to existing approaches."

Maintaining grid stability, particularly voltage regulation, requires new control methods to address these challenges. A promising approach for voltage regulation in active distribution grids is Model Predictive Control (MPC). While MPC offers the flexibility and responsiveness needed to manage the dynamic and uncertain nature of active distribution networks, its robustness against uncertainties remains underexplored. This work proposes a centralized MPC formulation for voltage regulation in distribution grids, with a focus on analyzing its robustness against uncertainties such as measurement and forecast errors, as well as communication failures. Case studies conducted on a SimBench low-voltage (LV) grid demonstrated the method’s robustness to the aforementioned uncertainties. To further advance the assessment of robustness, additional studies are required, particularly those that test the limits of the control framework across a broader range of test cases."

This paper introduces an Intelligent Undersampling Technique designed to enhance minority class detection while retaining the fundamental characteristics of the majority data. The proposed method IDR_IUT (Imbalance Data Reduction using Intelligent Undersampling Technique) strategically calculates the uncertainty score for all the instances of majority dataset and sort instances according to their uncertainty score. Later, retain majority samples whose calculated uncertainty score is less than user selected threshold and drop remaining samples as there are far from the decision boundary, thereby reducing data redundancy and enhancing decision boundary clarity. Experiments were carried out on Software Defect Prediction dataset extracted from PROMISE repository using classifier such as Naive Bayes. The results shows that IDR_IUT consistently attains higher precision, accuracy, recall, specificity, and F1 score, and balanced accuracy is compared with earlier undersampling methods (CBUS, IDRUS), with a notable increase of up to 93% in minority class detection. These results suggest that intelligent undersampling serves as an effective preprocessing strategy for building robust and equitable predictive models in imbalanced learning contexts. IDR_IUT algorithm was implemented using python programming."

Traditional control algorithms are difficult to effectively process the complex dynamic data in the operation of electromechanical systems, resulting in poor control accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, this paper proposes a dynamic adaptive attention optimized convolutional long short-term memory network (DA-ACLSTM) algorithm. The algorithm enhances the ability to extract key data features of electromechanical systems through a dynamic adaptive attention mechanism, and optimizes the convolutional long short-term memory network structure to improve the processing efficiency of data spatiotemporal characteristics. Taking the precision CNC machine tool servo system as the research object, 1000 sets of operation data are collected to construct an experimental data set, and the test is carried out in the constructed simulation experimental environment. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional LSTM algorithm, the DA-ACLSTM algorithm reduces the mean square error by 42.3 %, the mean absolute error by 38.6 %, and the response time by 27.5 % in position control; compared with the ordinary convolutional neural network, the mean square error in speed control decreases by 35.8 %, the mean absolute error by 32.1 %, and the overshoot by 22.4 %. The experiment fully verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the DA-ACLSTM algorithm in the intelligent control of electromechanical systems, and provides a new technical solution for the intelligent development of electromechanical systems."

This study provides updated benchmarks and practical tools for electrical designers, updating and refining outdated estimation practices which are still based on guidelines from the 1980s. The results highlight the urgent need for modernized, data-driven methods for peak demand estimation, and call for further research on the influence of outdoor temperature, building structures, ventilation systems, equipment levels, occupant behavior, and emerging loads such as electric vehicle charging."

    "abstract": "With the increasing reliance of power grids and critical infrastructure on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), the security of Industrial Control Protocols (ICPs) has become a growing concern. Many ICPs suffer from inadequate security mechanisms, making them inherently vulnerable to cyberattacks and posing significant risks to system integrity in critical infrastructure. Existing fuzzing techniques are valuable for vulnerability detection, while they often fail to model complex protocol sequences effectively and rely on random mutation strategies, limiting their ability to detect vulnerabilities in intricate systems. This paper introduces SPTFuzz, a novel fuzzing framework designed to address these limitations. By leveraging an enhanced Transformer architecture that incorporates a Spectral-Relational Fusion Mechanism, SPTFuzz captures long-range dependencies and spectral features, enhancing both protocol conformance and the diversity of test cases. Additionally, a mutation strategy based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to dynamically adjust mutation probabilities, optimizing vulnerability detection during fuzzing. Experimental results on the Modbus protocol demonstrate that SPTFuzz outperforms existing approaches, achieving higher test case recognition rates, greater data diversity, and improved anomaly detection."

The protocol guarantees safe, trustless communication, low-latency energy matching, and transparent transaction auditability without dependence on a central authority. The system is assessed using empirical data from the Pecan Street Dataport dataset, which includes high-resolution records of energy usage and solar output from more than 1,000 residences in Austin, Texas. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was executed in MATLAB Simulink, whilst smart contracts were deployed and evaluated via Remix IDE and Ganache on a private Ethereum network. Experimental findings indicate that BESP decreases transaction latency by 35.2%, reduces communication overhead by 27.8%, and enhances energy cost efficiency by more than 60% relative to traditional P2P and centralized frameworks. These findings underscore BESP's efficacy in facilitating energy-efficient, secure, and decentralized communications inside smart grids, in accordance with future sustainable infrastructure objectives."

This study simulates a DN using synthesized BESS power profiles, validated against a commercial BESS engaged in arbitrage (day-ahead and intraday) and Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) markets in Germany. Voltage regulation and line loading are then assessed across varying grid strengths by placing BESS units at multiple locations within the model. The results reveal a neutral to negative correlation between market-driven BESS operation and grid stability. When connected to strong grid locations, such as co-location with wind turbines (WTs) or at main substations, market-driven operation has minimal impact on voltage and line loadings. In contrast, BESS integration at weaker rural nodes leads to increased line overloading events, especially in summer months. Contrary to the common perception that BESS enhances grid stability, these findings demonstrate that uncoordinated market-driven BESS operation can adversely affect the stability of DNs."

Through microwave transmission theory and electromagnetic field simulation software, the RF transmission performance of the via interconnection structure was systematically analyzed. The optimized structure demonstrates superior transmission characteristics with insertion loss <0.3 dB and return loss (S11) ≤−15 dB within the 0-40 GHz frequency band. Featuring simplified fabrication processes and low manufacturing costs, this vertical interconnection solution effectively resolves interlayer connection challenges in multilayer flexed LCP circuit boards, showing significant potential for flexible TR RF circuit applications."

    "abstract": "Uncertainty in irrigation decision-making and duration prediction remains a significant challenge in tropical smart farming due to the high variability of environmental factors. The existing methods, such as rule-based and fuzzy logic, have been widely used to implement the irrigation prediction due to irrigation prediction due to their simplicity and low computational requirements. The remaining challenge is that these methods often fall short in two key aspects: (1) unable to effectively handle overlapping or ambiguous environmental conditions, referred to in this study as the uncertain decision zone, and (2) yielding static irrigation outputs, typically assigning a fixed irrigation duration regardless of actual field conditions. In such uncertain decision zones, there is no single parameter sufficient to define irrigation needs in a deterministic manner. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid rule-based and artificial neural network (ANN) approach to improve irrigation accuracy and adaptability. The proposed system utilizes rule-based logic for specific conditions and assigns uncertain situations to the ANN model, which forecasts adjustable irrigation durations that vary according to essential environmental factors rather than relying on static durations. Three approaches were evaluated: (1) rule-based only, (2) ANN-only, and (3) hybrid. Results show that the hybrid system achieved the best accuracy, with an MSE of 5.83 and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.82, compared to the ANN-only model (MSE 8.47, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> 0.76) and the rule-based model (MSE 20.59, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> –0.11)."

To address this and promote advanced charging strategies, this study investigates the effects of various charging methods on transformers and their long-term economic impact on grid owners. The analysis includes uncontrolled charging, smart charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging strategies, with an aging model for transformers developed based on the IEEE C57.91 standard. The daily operational cost and annual cost have been analyzed using standard parameters, incorporating the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of smart charging and V2G strategies in optimizing transformer loading and extending their lifecycle."

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking based on shadows in video SAR is a crucial approach for continuous scene monitoring. Existing shadow trackers typically employ two-stage detector and appearance-based association, which are inefficient in both extracting accurate shadow detections and corresponding reidentification features. Additionally, the defocusing effect of moving objects in video SAR generates shadows with similar appearances, resulting in low-precision of these trackers. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and accurate multi-object tracker based on the one-stage detector and motion-based association. First, we introduce recent YOLOv11-nano detector to achieve high-precision video SAR shadow detection with short time consumption. Second, we propose an expanded IoU based on the ByteTrack association mechanism to handle low-confidence detections, as the efficient solution to further improve shadow tracking performance. To validate the proposed method, we construct comparative and ablation experiments on the SNL dataset. Results show that our tracking method achieved 65.7 % MOTA and 75.0 FPS, significantly outperforming other methods. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method for both inference speed and tracking accuracy."

    "abstract": "In resource-constrained vehicle systems, establishing consistency between multi-view scenes and driver gaze remains challenging. Prior methods mainly focus on cross-source data fusion, estimating gaze or attention maps through unidirectional implicit links between scene and facial features. Although bidirectional projection can correct misalignment between predictions and ground truth, the high resolution of scene images and complex semantic extraction incur heavy computational loads. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight driver-attention estimation framework that leverages geometric consistency between scene and gaze to guide feature extraction bidirectionally, thereby strengthening representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature extraction module that captures global and local information in parallel through dual asymmetric branches to efficiently extract facial and scene features. An information cross fusion module is then designed to promote interaction between the scene and gaze streams. The multi-branch architecture extracts gaze and geometric cues at multiple scales, reducing the computational redundancy caused by mixed features when modeling geometric consistency across both views. Experiments on a large public dataset show that incorporating scene information introduces no significant computational overhead and yields a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, leveraging bidirectional projection and the temporal continuity of gaze, we preliminarily explore the framework’s potential for predicting attention trends."

Recent studies identify TTPs by converting audit logs into causal provenance graphs and applying expert-driven mappings that correlate low-level system events with high-level TTP patterns. However, these methods face persistent challenges: determining the impact boundaries of TTP activities, adapting to evolving TTP stacks, and recognizing fine-grained TTP semantics for deeper forensic insights. To address these challenges, we present <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Zoomer</small>, a novel TTP recognition framework that segments provenance graphs into multiple TTP subgraphs with multi-granular annotations (i.e., tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques). First, we devise a heuristic subgraph sampling algorithm guided by anomalous node detection to precisely delineate the scope of TTP activities. Second, we introduce a dual-tower Deep & Wide architecture that integrates contextual behavior semantics from provenance graphs and domain-informed features to learn expressive TTP representations. Finally, we adopt a prototypical network that reformulates TTP recognition as a few-shot pattern matching task, thereby enhancing adaptability and accuracy under limited supervision. To advance future research, we built and released the first TTP-annotated provenance dataset, encompassing the most comprehensive collection of TTP instances to date.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) contrastive learning (CL) has garnered significant attention in the realm of recommendation systems. However, existing models often employ random masking for graph enhancement, which can introduce sampling bias and impede interpretability. Furthermore, the KG–UIG information imbalance can lead to the neglect of critical information in the user–item interaction graph (UIG) by the model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, diffusion-augmented graph CL (DAGCL). This model leverages a graph diffusion mechanism for data enhancement in CL, thereby ensuring that the generated diffusion graph closely resembles the original UIG and avoiding the pitfalls associated with random sampling. Additionally, DAGCL enhances the impact of UIG on predictive accuracy by implementing both intragraph and intergraph CL (GCL), effectively mitigating the information imbalance between KGs and UIG. The model also leverages the structural characteristics of the UIG to construct a structural diffusion graph, which is integrated with the information diffusion graph to produce a comprehensive diffusion representation—further enhancing the model’s robustness against sampling noise and semantic dilution by preserving essential interaction patterns and structural features in the augmented graph. Experimental results across three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly."

Although triple-well on-chip solar cells improve photovoltaic conversion efficiency, their multiport output characteristics pose design challenges: conventional parallel output schemes cannot address the mismatch in maximum power point (MPP) voltages among ports, thereby limiting energy extraction efficiency. Moreover, fully integrated EH systems lack external storage, and input–output coupling renders traditional voltage regulation unsuitable. To address these challenges, this article presents a fully integrated dual-channel EH system that employs a dual-port, independently boosted parallel architecture combined with a frequency-driven lightweight self-regulation mechanism, eliminating the need for conventional regulators. Measurement results show that the system achieves a stable output voltage of approximately 1.22 V, a peak end-to-end efficiency of 63.97%, and a 6.31% improvement in maximum output power, while also exhibiting reliable start-up and ripple suppression, providing valuable guidance for the design of efficient power extraction and self-regulation in on-chip photovoltaic EH systems."

In this paper, the effects of FWW on the eigenfrequency and eigenmode of stator assembly are investigated based on finite element (FE) method, which is calibrated firstly by a 6-layer FWW stator. It is found that the eigenfrequency of stator assembly with consideration of end winding of FWW is lower than that without consideration of end winding, since the end winding of FWW contributes more on mass effect than stiffness.

In higher-level control, this paper employs an interpretable fuzzy system (IFS) to control the CPG waves of hip joints to execute the wall-following task. The IFS considers not only control performance but also model interpretability. To improve learning performance, this paper proposes a multiobjective evolutionary IFS through rule and fuzzy-set pruning (MEIFS-RFP) to optimize the IFS structure and parameters. Simulations and comparisons with different control and learning methods are performed to show the advantages of the proposed control approach.

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence and complexity of spam have made detection a critical challenge, particularly in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments affecting millions of users worldwide. This surge of unsolicited messages, ranging from advertisements to phishing attempts necessitates robust and efficient detection mechanisms. Traditional rule-based filters and static blacklists fail to adapt to evolving spam tactics, while ML and DL models, though effective, often impose computational and memory demands unsuitable for IoT devices. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a resource-efficient hybrid model that combines a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) for contextual feature extraction with XGBoost for efficient classification. The Bi-GRU layer captures complex, bidirectional semantic dependencies in SMS text such as obfuscated phrases like \"Fr33 money\" while the XGBoost classifier enhances robustness to class imbalance and ensures computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the model’s improved performance and generalization capability, achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SMS Spam Collection dataset while maintaining strong cross-domain performance with 98.35% accuracy and 99.8% AUC on the SpamAssassin email corpus. More critically for IoT deployment, it realized a reduction in inference latency and significant savings in energy, CPU, memory, and computational FLOPs compared to CNN-LSTM and Bi-LSTM baselines. These results highlight an optimal balance between predictive performance and resource efficiency, positioning the hybrid as a practical, deployable solution for real-time spam detection in IoT-edge environments."

    "abstract": "We investigate why inventors choose specific collaborators and how different collaboration patterns shape the relationship between network stability and exploratory innovation in interdisciplinary contexts. Using nano-energy patents (1998-2021) from the Derwent World Patent Index, we find that collaboration network stability hinders exploratory innovation, and this effect is moderated by assortativity. We classify collaborations into two types based on inventors' assortativity and network location: high assortativity collaboration, where core (peripheral) inventors work with others in similar locations, and low assortativity collaboration, where inventors collaborate across different network locations. We further examine how these collaborations influence the impact mechanism, challenging the conventional assumption of core-core collaboration. Robustness tests, including narrowed sample windows and alternative variable measures, confirm the consistency of results. Our findings provide nuanced insights into how partner selection and collaboration structures affect exploratory innovation, offering practical guidance for managers seeking to design effective collaboration strategies in technology-driven and interdisciplinary organizations. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Managerial Relevance Statement-</i>This study offers actionable insights for managers tasked with organizing and leading innovation teams in dynamic interdisciplinary environments. Our finding that network stability impedes exploratory innovation underscores the importance of reconsidering collaborator selection. Managers should carefully balance the benefits of predictable, stable networks with the need for fresh perspectives. Notably, individual inventor collaborative preferences—the tendency to collaborate with similar peers (assortativity)—should also be closely monitored. As the effects of these preferences vary depending on an inventor's position within the network, organizations should promote cross-boundary collaboration, particularly between core and peripheral members. Such collaboration fosters the exchange of heterogeneous ideas and mitigates cognitive inertia. By aligning collaboration preferences with strategic network locations, organizations can sustain exploratory innovation and remain competitive in rapidly evolving technological landscapes. This study also contributes to the following SDGs: SDG 7, SDG 17."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) for epilepsy inevitably contains artifacts that may obscure epileptiform discharges or, in some cases, provide valuable diagnostic clues. Accurate classification of different artifact types is therefore clinically important. This paper proposes a hybrid artifact classification method that integrates deep learning and handcrafted features. A CNN-CBAM-LSTM network is employed to capture temporal features, while time-domain, frequency-domain, and entropy-based handcrafted features are extracted to complement the representation. The combined feature set is refined using the Relief-F algorithm to reduce redundancy and enhance discriminability, followed by a random forest classifier for final recognition. Experiments were conducted on long-term clinical EEG recordings, including six artifact types: eye movement, muscle, chewing, electrode, blinking, and rhythmic chewing. Results show that the proposed method achieves 97.8% classification accuracy, surpassing existing approaches. By leveraging both the automatic feature learning capability of deep models and the interpretability of handcrafted features, the method demonstrates high accuracy and strong generalization potential for artifact classification in epileptic EEG analysis."

It integrates the self-attention mechanism and the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) framework into the classic Conditional Variational Autoencoder - Generative Adversarial Network (CVAE-GAN), aiming to generate physically sound and visually realistic galaxy images, simultaneously achieving more stable training and lower computational costs. The experimental results presented in this paper encompass three modules: intuitive perception, metric evaluation, and morphological visualization assessment. Findings demonstrate that on the Galaxy10SDSS dataset, the model generates simulation images with excellent visual quality, achieving metrics comparable to large-scale models, while the distribution of simulated images closely resembles that of real images. This research provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing high-performance, small-scale models for galaxy image generation. As such, it represents a significant contribution to the broader field of astronomical data simulation and analysis."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework based on Model Predictive Control, for the delivery of a synthetic inertia service, coupled with a procedure to dynamically size the inertial response of a unit composed by a wind farm and an electrolyzer. During normal operations, the system meets a continuous demand of hydrogen, maximizes wind generation and gets ready to provide synthetic inertia by optimally sizing the synthetic inertia time constant according to the current unit capability. When a significant frequency drop occurs, according to specific activation rules, the unit provides synthetic inertia with the pre-defined size by coordinating the contribution of the wind turbines and of the electrolyzer. The method is validated through simulations at different wind speed conditions."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has transformed medical image analysis, yielding cutting-edge outcomes in tasks including llness detection, segmentation, and classification. These approaches, however, frequently depend on substantial amounts of annotated data, which are hard to come by in the medical field since expert-labeled datasets are few and annotation costs are expensive. A potential approach to get over this restriction is few-shot learning (FSL), which allows models to generalize well from a small number of labeled examples per class. Three typical model families on the PathMNIST subset of the MedMNIST benchmark are thoroughly compared in this study: Transfer learning using (1) Prototypical Networks (ProtoNet), (2) Matching Networks (MatchingNet), and (3) a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on ResNet18. To assess the models' flexibility under various degrees of data scarcity, they are tested in a variety of few-shot scenarios, such as 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot learning. We use a variety of performance parameters, including as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), to guarantee a thorough assessment. The experimental results show that meta-learning approaches, especially ProtoNet and MatchingNet, consistently outperform the baseline in extremely low-data regimes, highlighting their ability to leverage relational inductive biases, while the baseline CNN benefits from increasing training samples and exhibits stable performance in higher-shot scenarios. These results give useful information on the advantages and disadvantages of various FSL paradigms as well as helpful recommendations for creating reliable medical image classification systems in settings with limited data."

Accurate weight data before and after delivery is essential for ensuring fair trade and effective livestock management. This research develops an IoT-based goat weight data collection system using the Prototyping method, integrating an Arduino Uno microcontroller with Load Cell and RFID sensors.

However, challenges remain in reliably detecting, tracking, and classifying activities across dynamic and crowded environments. This work presents an enhanced HAR system that integrates pose estimation, people tracking, and action classification, leveraging deep learning to address these challenges. Using MediaPipe for precise pose estimation, the system accurately identifies key human body points critical for distinguishing activities. The DeepSORT algorithm, with Kalman filtering, maintains consistent tracking of individuals across multiple frames, even in motion-heavy settings. A ResNet101-based classifier interprets tracked pose sequences to provide accurate activity classification.

    "abstract": "Understanding the concept of image steganography in a fast-changing world is crucial for grasping its significance today and in the future. Image steganography is the art of hiding data, which can be in any form of text, picture, or other media like audio or video, so a person cannot detect it easily with their naked eyes. With the developments in image steganography in early times, this practice has changed significantly, adapting to the changing ground of technology and cyber security. Now, the watermarking scheme is also embedded with image steganography so that the security of the image will be enhanced. These rising strategies (GAN, CNN, deep learning, and artificial intelligence) are crucial for a healthy digital environment. This paper provides a summary of different methods of image steganography. By examining history and modern techniques, this paper reviews the importance of image steganography as a powerful weapon for ensuring privacy, safeguarding intellectual property, and strengthening communication security. Further research is needed to explore new ideas or enhancements in this area for a better future."

    "abstract": "The system is established as an anomaly detection using different machine-learning techniques to analyze network data during attacks, mostly Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The system begins processing data through the Load Data module, which is responsible for feeding the network traffic data from a benchmark dataset into its processes and organizing those data. The loading module can read data from structured data sources, such as databases, CSV, and JSON files, for multi-views of cybercrimes. Proper loading of data ensures that it can be used for further processes, which is essential for a reliable analysis and subsequently for an efficient analysis. The Data Pre-Processing Module works to scrub and refine the original data such that it maintains generality to machine learning classification. This means treating missing values by means of imputation or deletion, encoding categorical variables, either one-hot or through label encoding, and normalizing numerical attributes to prepare them for comparison to one other. Also, removing any other non-predictive features will conserve learning from unnecessary computations and quicken processing. Such adjustments will, therefore, facilitate building a formidable, reliable intrusion detection system. The proposed method allows for DoS threats to be detected from careful analysis of network traffic data augmented with powerful feature engineering, and preprocessing methods. A well-structured dataset adds to the machine learning tool's discrimination of normal versus malicious behavior other than just the employment of standard features or optimization thereof. Thus, this pathway greatly enhances the real-time detection and elimination of threats aiding cybersecurity."

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving Generative AI (GenAI) consumer market, DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup, has emerged as a disruptive force, captured global attention in early 2025 by leading app download rankings and triggering a notable decline in US tech stocks. Amidst widespread media coverage and comparisons against established competitors like ChatGPT, the specific performance attributes of GenAI that matter to users remain underexplored. This study addresses the gap by identifying the key service quality attributes of GenAI that are valued by consumers using DeepSeek. Content analysis on 953 DeepSeek user comments was done using Leximancer to reveal 11 key themes: “AI”, “better”, “app”, “voice”, “feature”, “China”, “using”, “OpenAI”, “accurate”, “update”, and “perfect”. The findings reveal that users highly prioritize attributes such as conversational interaction, multilingual capabilities, and information accuracy, which collectively shape their perception of service quality. Notably, the theme “better” highlights users’ comparative evaluations of DeepSeek against rivals like ChatGPT and Gemini, emphasizing its open-source nature and cost-effectiveness. Meanwhile, themes like “voice” and “feature” underscore the demand for multimodal functionality and continuous innovation, while “China” reflects geopolitical and data privacy considerations influencing user trust. The study extends service-quality perspectives to GenAI by articulating construct-level implications (e.g., multimodality, data-governance trust, comparative value) and translating them into concrete design and governance actions for practitioners. It extends beyond traditional frameworks like SERVQUAL by identifying a set of dimensions unique to AI-driven environments. For practitioners, the findings provide actionable insights for developers and managers to enhance user experience, prioritize feature updates, and address privacy concerns. By aligning GenAI development with consumer expectations, this research supports the creation of more competitive and user-centric AI applications. Future research directions include cross-platform comparisons and longitudinal studies to track evolving service quality standards in the dynamic GenAI landscape."

As a critical front-end component in high-speed rail systems, the CHBR is susceptible to voltage and current fluctuations caused by the PCS, which can lead to misdiagnosis in residual-based fault detection. To address this, a mathematical model of the PCS is established to analyze its impact on system states and residual characteristics. Then, an optimized fault detection strategy based on operating condition recognition is proposed. This method dynamically identifies PCS events by monitoring the rectifier's input current and DC-link voltage, thereby blocking the fault detection signal to prevent misdiagnosis. Simulation results confirm the enhanced detection accuracy under various operating conditions, including traction, overvoltage, half-load, and no-load."

This study proposes an Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder (ECAE) to address image anomaly detection tasks. The model innovatively integrates a multi-scale skip connections architecture and a composite loss function that weights the mean squared error and visual similarity index at a 6:4 ratio, enhancing reconstruction quality through a feature reuse mechanism. Furthermore, ECAE incorporates a triple-modality anomaly scoring system which combines pixel-level reconstruction error, structural similarity measure, and latent space Mahalanobis distance based on robust minimum covariance determinant (MinCovDet) estimation. Experimental results on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset demonstrate that ECAE achieves a detection accuracy of 95.1% and precision of 96.2%, significantly outperforming the other three traditional autoencoder methods. This research provides a high-precision and biologically-inspired solution for industrial visual inspection systems, particularly in precision manufacturing and medical image analysis applications where reliable anomaly detection is critical."

Traditional schedulers, such as Round-Robin (RR) and Greedy-Then-Oldest (GTO), employ static strategies that struggle with adapting to diverse workloads, causing performance disparities across different applications. Prior work has focused on aspects like critical warps and memory access locality but has often overlooked the arithmetic intensity of workloads. Drawing inspiration from the Roofline model and recognizing that different workloads exhibit distinct computational intensities, we propose an Arithmetic Intensity based CacheConscious Adaptive Warp Scheduler (AICAWS). It operates by first analyzing the kernel's static arithmetic intensity through compiler, which serves as a baseline for the hardware. Subsequently, during warp execution, AICAWS dynamically monitors the warp's execution progress, analyzes its runtime arithmetic intensity, and adjusts warp scheduling strategies based on this. Furthermore, AICAWS considers cache locality during warp execution, enabling fine-grained classification of warps based on this. This synergistic mechanism enables AICAWS to effectively hide long-latency memory access operations. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that AICAWS achieves an average performance improvement of 26.3% compared to the baseline scheduler, with a peak improvement of 77.9%."

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are frequently used to track and investigate epilepsy; nevertheless, manual interpretation of these signals is laborious, subjective, and necessitates ongoing professional supervision. In this study, we suggest an automatic method for classifying EEG segments as seizure or non-seizure based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, a well-known standard in epilepsy research, was used to train the model. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 99%, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

Simulation results for a representative day show that coordinated load shifting within the REC not only increases local self-consumption but also improves overall network performance. Compared to the base case, voltage deviations are reduced from 15 V to 7 V, network losses fall to one-third of their original level, and the self-consumption rate rises from 57% to 87%, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized appliance scheduling in maximizing the use of locally generated energy."

Three configurations are analyzed: a baseline case without SC integration, SCs directly connected to the DC link, and SCs interfaced via a DC/DC converter. To evaluate the system behavior under these configurations, a dynamic model of the PEM electrolyzer is implemented to capture its transient response. Based on this model, analytical formulas are derived for sizing the energy buffer required to maintain continuous operation during grid disturbances. In parallel, a unified control strategy is proposed to coordinate power flow between the grid, SCs, and the electrolyzer. Time-domain simulations confirm that only the SC-supported configurations maintain uninterrupted hydrogen production during a severe grid voltage sag. The DC/DC-based layout reduces the number of SCs and offers greater control flexibility, while the direct connection provides a simpler solution. These results provide design insight for the robust integration of hydrogen systems into future power grids."

However, they still face issues of low detection accuracy and poor detection efficiency in certain fields, urgently requiring new solutions. To address this, this paper introduces an object detection algorithm named “YOLOv9-SpeedPin.” This model builds upon YOLOv9 by incorporating several innovations. Specifically, it replaces the Backbone network with GhostNetV2, modifies the Head to include the GSConv+Slim-Neck module, and substitutes the ADown in the Auxiliary Branch with the HWD module, all aimed at reducing the computational workload of the model. By incorporating the three attention mechanisms of LSKA, GAM, and SENet, the model ensures enhanced precision. YOLOv9-SpeedPin achieves a 4.3% improvement in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{mAP}_{50}$</tex> and a 4.8% increase in detection speed. Compared to existing algorithms under the same conditions, this algorithm maintains a higher accuracy advantage. Furthermore, the occurrences of false positives and missed detections are significantly reduced."

    "abstract": "Hardware prefetchers are essential for hiding memory latency and improving performance in commercial processors. However, recent studies have revealed that they can be exploited to launch side-channel attacks that leak sensitive data, recover cryptographic keys, and break the isolation of trusted execution environments. We observe that such attacks closely resemble classic memory safety violations, including buffer overflows, type confusion, use-after-free, and data race. This paper presents TIPS (Tag AugmentatIon for Prefetcher Security), a lightweight extension to the memory safety mechanisms already deployed in commercial processors. TIPS enhances memory tagging to protect prefetchers by enforcing tag-based array bounds, validating pointer types, associating prefetch patterns with their source threads or cores, and suppressing contentionbased interference. Experiments demonstrate that TIPS incurs less than 1.50 % performance overhead and 0.81 % area cost, while providing strong defense against a broad class of prefetcher side-channel attacks."

    "abstract": "With the exponential advancement of technology, the need for education in the fields of science and engineering is more crucial than ever. Students must be introduced to scientific concepts at an earlier age and through more hands-on educational practices, in order to not only build a solid foundation in science and technology but also to develop a genuine passion for turning their ideas into reality. Educational IoT integrated systems offer an innovative methodology that combines fundamental sciences, emerging information and communication technologies, and insights from the study of human behavior. The integration of IoT-based projects into the “digital school” is supported by contemporary learning theories, which assert that knowledge creation becomes more effective when students are actively engaged in constructing products that hold personal meaning. Furthermore, educational IoT integrated systems foster critical thinking, creativity, and resilience by encouraging students to develop their own strategies for addressing challenges under proper guidance. The ultimate objective is to empower students to build functional projects from scratch using smart academic tools that automate the most complex processes, allowing them to first internalize essential concepts with confidence. This paper presents the design and implementation of a simple educational microecosystem, demonstrating how fundamental principles from control systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation can be effectively combined to enhance student learning and engagement."

Conventional file-sharing solutions fell short of effectively handling larger files and robust privacy controls. This study provides a safe file-sharing system which uses Automatic File Expiration which enhances the security and confidentiality of data. Variable-Sized Chunking is another feature that ensures maximum storage utilization. The system reduces redundancy and enhances performance by dynamically chunking files via the Rolling Hash Algorithm. We used Time-to-Live (TTL) and Cron Jobs to automate file expiration for easy cleanups. In addition, a log system is always maintained that monitors user activity. This ensures accountability by documenting recent activities such as uploading, downloading, forwarding files, etc., to trace irregularities. We make sure that the right people can send, forward, and download the files in the organization with the help of JWT authentication. By creating bridges between these technologies the platform increases data integrity, security, and compliance that helps in handling large files with ease in an organization. The system achieved an 8.98 % gain in storage efficiency, while maintaining secure access controls and enabling seamless large file handling across enterprise networks."

The fused images are then input into the 2DCNN to extract spatial features, while the perturbed signal is processed by the GRU to capture temporal features. Finally, the extracted features are enhanced and fused using the AT mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the limitations of single-modal approaches by combining information from multiple modalities, significantly improving the accuracy of disturbance recognition."

The experiment built a smart home simulation environment containing multiple sensors such as temperature, humidity, and light, and used 100,000 pieces of data actually collected as samples to compare with traditional fixed-period collection algorithms and threshold-triggered collection algorithms. The results show that the data collection accuracy of the ADWDA algorithm reaches 98.6%, which is 16.3% higher than the traditional algorithm; the average CPU usage is reduced to 28.7%, and the memory usage is reduced by 21.5%; the data collection delay is shortened to 32 ms, which is more than 60% lower than the traditional algorithm.

For the Legal Document Retrieval task we applied an ensemble method: semantic searching with embedding outputs from BGE-M3 transformer model and traditional ranking methods using word information: BM25, TF-IDF supported by a topic classification model. After pre-ranking step we used a relevant classification model to grade the retrieved document as relevant or not relevant. These supportive models (topic/relevant classification) were trained by combining both original data and LLM-augmented data for better accuracy. The final score is combined using tuned hyperparameters and will be compared with an ensemble threshold to get filtered. For the Legal Question Answering task, we have three types of questions: true/false questions, multiple-choices question and free-text question. Suppose that the retrieved document from previous stage is correct, we address this problem by using Large Language Model (LLM) with prompt engineering technique to attain the generalization of LLM on the question answering task. While our approach did not attain the highest scores in the competition, it proved that using LLM-synthesized data within an adaptive pipeline (integrating LLMs with auxiliary models) effectively mitigates data scarcity limitations."

    "abstract": "Electrolytic hydrogen is expected to play a key role in decarbonizing energy systems in Europe. However, such projects face uncertain grid access due to congestion and struggle with financial viability. To address growing grid congestion in the Netherlands, different types of non-firm connection and transport agreements (CTAs) and capacity restriction contracts (CRCs) were introduced, enabling client curtailment in exchange for tariff discounts or per-MW compensation. This paper investigates investment and contracting decisions for electrolyzer projects under these novel contracts using a two-stage risk-aware stochastic optimization model that captures uncertainty in electricity prices and grid access. Results show that risk-averse clients prefer non-firm CTA-85 contracts, which balance tariff discounts with curtailment compensation, while risk-neutral clients favor standard non-firm CTAs. The new contract types can lower the break-even hydrogen price by approximately €0.50/kg compared to firm contracts outside congested areas, and thus improve the business case for electrolytic hydrogen in the Netherlands."

The upper-level optimization aims to minimize the curtailment of photovoltaic (PV) generation and space heating loads, subject to grid operational constraints. Numerical experiments highlight the advantages of interconnected, multi-source heating systems in delivering heating demand without compromising user comfort and violating grid constraints."

    "abstract": "The ever growing complexity of software systems makes it imperative to use automated techniques in proposing and deploying design patterns to enhance the maintainability, modularity and lessen the coupling of the software. Conventional methods may be mostly based on manual detection or small to medium amount of heuristic-driven tools which may be time consuming, error prone and may not generalize across different code bases. In response to this, we introduce an artificial intelligence-based recommendation system that combines multimodal software representations, knowledge graphs, and self-supervised pretraining to identify, suggest, and generate design pattern refactorings. The system builds a rich repository of design patterns, and quality attributes, trade-offs and transformation rules are represented in a machine-readable form. A high-quality dataset is built by heuristic-based static analysis, expert verification, and synthetic data augmentation using source code, documentation, commit histories, and runtime logs. GNNs and transformer models are used to supplement multi-modal embeddings based on ASTs, control-data flow, dependency networks, and token-level embeddings to reflect structural, behavioral, and semantic nuances. Knowledge graph captures patterns, anti-patterns, and refactoring rules, and makes prescriptive recommendations. Experimental analysis into the Design Patterns Detection Benchmark Dataset shows that the system outperforms the current methods with 92.4-percent precision, 90.8-percent recall, 91.6-percent F1-score, and 93.2-percent accuracy and the shortest runtime of 1.8 seconds. Findings verify the fact that the suggested methodology does not only lead to increased accuracy in prediction, but also to increased practical efficiency, providing a powerful, scalable solution to automated design pattern recommendation and refactoring."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated outstanding performance in high-quality image synthesis. However, challenges persist in terms of structural controllability, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse conditional inputs. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes SF-SD (Steady Flow Stable Diffusion), an enhanced diffusion framework that integrates architectural optimizations to improve generation fidelity, structural coherence, and efficiency. The proposed SF-SD model incorporates three key components: a feature compression module that leverages an autoencoder to project high-dimensional image data into a compact latent space, significantly reducing computational and storage costs; a conditional information modeling mechanism that combines semantic cues and structural features via a cross-attention mechanism, enhancing the model's responsiveness to user-defined prompts; and a skeletal control module that utilizes edge-based constraints to preserve object contours and spatial layout during the generation process. To assess its performance, a dedicated high-resolution dataset was constructed, and extensive comparative experiments were conducted against standard Stable Diffusion, conditional-enhanced diffusion models, and GAN-based methods. Quantitative results show that SF-SD achieves superior SSIM, PSNR, and FID scores, while reducing generation time by over 40% and improving semantic alignment. Ablation studies further demonstrate the independent contribution of each module to the overall performance improvement. SF-SD provides a scalable and generalizable framework for controllable image generation under multi-modal constraints. The proposed model is particularly well-suited for applications requiring structure-aware, high-fidelity synthesis within computationally constrained environments."

Conventional epidemiological models are limited in their ability to forecast outbreaks because they rely on past data and are not adaptable in real time. The study herein presents a novel approach to Mpox outbreak risk prediction by combining Deep Neural Network (DNN) predictive modelling and public opinion analysis. The DNN model utilizes epidemiological indicators, demographic factors, and spatial parameters for forecasting potential outbreak hotspots with improved accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods. In parallel, we captured public sentiment on Mpox through natural language processing of social media, news stories, and public health alerts. The results of 0.997 accuracy indicate robust correlations between trends in public perception and outbreak dynamics, providing valuable insights into community knowledge and response readiness. This two-way process enables public health professionals not only to predict risk areas but also to understand the social determinants underlying disease spread. The findings demonstrate that predictive modelling in combination with sentiment analysis is a more complete risk assessment strategy, facilitating improved and directed intervention efforts. It is an interventional methodology for surveillance and response that is transferable to other future infectious diseases, illustrating the utility of including social information in epidemiological modelling."

However, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNS) have limitations in capturing the global context information of images. While Visual Transformer (ViT) has the ability to model long-range dependencies, it is prone to problems such as feature redundancy and insufficient generalization ability on small-scale medical image datasets. To this end, this paper proposes an improved model based on ViT, combining the Semantic attention Filtering and parameter clustering dimension reduction module (TSFS: Transformer with Semantic Filtering and Selection). This method screens out the most discriminative image regions through learnable query vectors and introduces an end-to-end differentiable clustering mechanism, thereby generating compact and information-rich image representations. The results, based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses, demonstrate that TSFS outperforms both CNN and ViT-based transformers in medical image classification tasks."

    "abstract": "Students encounter multi-dimensional dynamic challenges in the learning process, while traditional student performance analysis, which relies on static data, fails to capture the complex relationships in learning behaviors, resulting in delayed interventions. To address this issue, this paper proposes an algorithm for constructing educational dynamic knowledge graphs and predicting intervention nodes by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The semantic understanding capability of LLMs (such as parsing homework errors and classroom needs) assists GNNs in building a dynamic heterogeneous knowledge graph of “students-knowledge points-teaching resources-interactive behaviors”, breaking the limitations of static data. To make up for the deficiency of GNNs in deep semantic mining, a knowledge-based semantic structure mining module (combined with Qwen2) is designed to improve the accuracy of node representation. In addition, an Integrated One Graph (IOG) module is adopted to unify individual and group classification into the prediction of “key intervention nodes”, enhancing the generalization ability across educational scenarios. Experimental results show that the IOG-CIQAN model achieves an accuracy of over 87 % in tasks such as performance early warning and personalized path recommendation, outperforming traditional machine learning baselines. This study provides an effective technical framework for precise educational intervention."

This paper investigates how implicit (price-based) and explicit (control-based) flexibility mechanisms can be combined at the household level to mitigate these challenges. In this study, an agent-based simulation was developed to model a residential neighborhood in the Netherlands with varying levels of participation in flexibility programs. Results show that implicit flexibility, particularly at moderate levels of adoption, provides considerable cost savings but limited congestion relief. Explicit flexibility is more effective at reducing congestion, especially at high participation levels, albeit affecting comfort and generating additional costs. A combination of the two flexibility strategies eliminates congestion entirely and introduces trade-offs in comfort. This approach offers a robust solution for managing low-voltage grid congestion while optimizing household costs and minimizing distribution system operator compensation for explicit flexibility."

This paper introduces symbolic infrastructure - a new transdisciplinary framework through which aestheticmaterial systems mediate complex knowledge within human-machine ecosystems. Drawing from semiotics, actor-network theory, object-oriented ontology, and transhumanist thought, symbolic infrastructure positions artist-designed interfaces not as visual add-ons, but as active architectures of cognition. Rather than reducing complexity, symbolic infrastructures translate it into experiential formats using digital aesthetics, affective cognition, and multimodal interaction. Interfaces, installations, garments, and visualizations do not merely represent data—they enact data. These symbolic agents function as connective tissues between disciplines and audiences, enabling knowledge to be co-created and inhabited across technological and cultural contexts. The concept is both theorized and tested through Data Landscapes and the Body Silos (2024), an art exhibition developed through sustained collaboration with an AI curatorial assistant. This case study operationalizes symbolic infrastructure as a dynamic system of transhuman co-creation. By foregrounding symbolic infrastructure, the paper proposes a new paradigm for knowledge mediation—one in which digital aesthetics and machine collaboration expand our modes of understanding in the post-digital condition."

This review has selected 11 studies on ML models to summarize the trends, opportunities, and challenges. Deep Learning (DL) has proven to be one of the most effective ML approaches, achieving an accuracy rate above 80%. Classic ML methods, however, remain relevant, particularly for feature selection or as classifiers when the dataset is limited. The high dimensionality of genetic data highlights the importance of effective feature selection. Although results vary, one study employing an assisted DL approach reported 100% accuracy, demonstrating the potential of combining DL with feature filtering. Overall, ML methods show promise in capturing feature-level nuances. However, they still require feature selection and multimodal data integration strategies to address challenges like limited samples and complex data structures.

Early detection is critical to prevent long-term vision impairment. This project proposes a dual model approach leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance amblyopia diagnosis through both image-based and genetic risk analysis. The first model utilizes an image classifier to analyze eye images, identifying physical markers of amblyopia using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers. The second model incorporates Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms to evaluate genetic predispositions and familial risk factors, offering a probabilistic assessment of a child's susceptibility to developing amblyopia. A hybrid model integrates both the image-based and genetic-risk predictions, producing a unified risk score to improve diagnostic accuracy. This comprehensive diagnostic framework holds potential for early detection of amblyopia and a more personalized, predictive approach to pediatric eye care. By combining visual and genetic data, the proposed method aims to provide clinicians with a robust tool to address amblyopia risk more accurately and efficiently."

    "abstract": "Volcanic clouds are generated during explosive activities and are mainly composed of particles (called tephra), ice particles and gases (such as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{CO2}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{SO2}$</tex>). Tephra come in different shapes and sizes. Among them, fine ash particles (of the order of microns) are dispersed in the atmosphere, representing a natural threat for population and aviation. A prompt characterization of the volcanic cloud properties, in terms of top cloud and advection altitude, Particles Radius (PR) and Fine Ash Total Mass (FATM), typically used to initialize the dispersal models, can help to constrain dispersal models outputs and mitigate the volcanic hazard. In this scenario, satellite sensors are a useful source of data and can be exploited to monitor volcanoes in particular those that are not monitored by a ground based system. Passive thermal infrared radiometers, on board low earth orbit and geostationary satellites, are commonly used to study distally dispersed volcanic clouds due to the different spectral response of silicate and water/ice particles in the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8-14 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> wavelength range. In the last 30 years, different Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) algorithms have been implemented to study volcanic cloud properties. These RTM algorithms simulate the top of the atmosphere radiance detected by a passive radiometer, by solving the radiative transfer differential equation under simplified assumptions. Conventional RTM simulate the spectral radiance of two channels centered around 11 and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>, due to the different absorption behavior of silicate and water particles. The former absorbs more radiation at around <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$11 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>, the latter at around <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>. Hence, the spectral difference of these two channels is employed in ash retrieval algorithms. In this work we compare the estimates of PR and FATM obtained from two RTMs. The first is the MODTRAN [1] code, that computes the radiance over a broad band wavelength window (from ultraviolet to thermal infrared), and it is based on the assumption of a homogeneous stratified atmosphere. The second is a RTM fully described in [2], [3] and based on the assumptions reported in [4]. It solves the radiative transfer differential equation considering either one layer or two layers approximation. The FATM and PR are estimated by the two algorithms for two volcanic clouds generated at Mt. Etna (Italy): the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$24{ }^{\\text{th }}$</tex> November 2006 and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$23{ }^{\\text{rd }}$</tex> November 2013 eruptions.

During this event, the volcanic cloud dispersed in the south-southeast direction, and the ash fallout affected the city of Catania and the Fontanarossa international airport, which was temporarily closed, indeed [5].

The eruption generated a magma jet of about 1 km and an eruption column height of 9 km above sea level. The volcanic cloud was distally dispersed in the north-east direction, preserving the Fontanarossa international airport from the tephra fallout [6]. The estimated FATM and PR quantities, show a good agreement between the two models in terms of maps of dispersed volcanic clouds."

    "abstract": "Deception detection has been a topic of interest for nearly a century and has applications in many practical areas such as law, security, and recruitment, where accurately assessing human behavior can lead to better decision-making. Traditional deception detection methods often rely on physiological signals, such as polygraphs, which are invasive and susceptible to bias due to individual differences in physiological characteristics. Meanwhile, visual data is a non-invasive source of information, easy to collect, and contains many non-verbal behavioral cues. Most current visual-based deception detection methods process data at the frame-level using features such as action units and eye gaze, which do not fully take advantage of temporal dynamics. This paper has proposed a lightweight and efficient deception detection method based on visual data, utilizing dynamic images and a SmallCNN-BiLSTM ensemble model for feature extraction and time-series modeling. Specifically, dynamic images help synthesize essential motion information into a single image, reduce noise from irrelevant small movements, and optimize computational cost compared to processing each frame individually. Bi-LSTM enables the capture of temporal dependencies in both directions (past and future), allowing the model to learn a more complete context to distinguish deceptive behavior. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy, while reducing computational costs and is suitable for deployment in real-world applications."

However, these signals are frequently affected by various forms of noise during acquisition, and the presence of low-quality ECG signals significantly impairs the accuracy of both diagnosis and analysis. Consequently, the development of automated algorithms for ECG signal quality assessment is critical to effectively identify high-quality signals. In this paper, we propose a lightweight one-dimensional multi-scale convolutional neural network (1D-MSCNN) that is capable of automatically extracting features without human intervention to efficiently detect ECG signals of acceptable categories. The proposed approach is assessed through two distinct ECG quality assessment datasets, one derived from a self-collected ECG dataset and the other from a publicly available database, while also considering the model's computational complexity. The model achieves accuracy rates of 98.86% and 97.92% on the two test sets, with sensitivities of 97.92% and 100%, and specificities of 99.76% and 95.81%, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms current deep learning models with respect to overall performance, and the proposed model has small computational complexity, which balances the classification accuracy and practicality, and has a good application prospect in the ECG quality assessment task."

    "abstract": "Plug-and-play photovoltaic (PV) systems offer a simple and accessible alternative for residential power generation. These systems, which integrate a PV panel and a microinverter, can be connected directly to a household socket. This paper evaluates the technical performance, safety, and economic viability of one such system in the Belgian residential context, where plug-and-play PV is allowed for residential use since March 17<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>, 2025. Laboratory tests were conducted to assess compliance with safety standards, including over/under-voltage protection, and anti-islanding response. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis was performed using real consumption profiles and dynamic and fixed electricity tariff structures. The results show that while plug-and-play PV systems are limited in capacity, they are financially interesting. However, their profitability strongly depends on installation conditions and user consumption behavior. The system that was tested in our lab displayed compliance with most standard requirements but presented a problematic behavior in terms of harmonic current distortion, which stresses the importance of ensuring the quality of the (cheap) microinverters used for these purposes."

This effectively prevents interference from reflected signals on incident signals, making the model suitable for full-band testing of Band 41."

    "abstract": "The upcoming Wi-Fi 8 standard is heading towards reliability, with a strong focus on machine-type communications and time-critical applications. In this work, we present a novel approach to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) in Wi-Fi systems by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) models for proactive channel switching. We propose two time-series prediction models in this regard. The predictive QoS (pQoS) model assesses the probability of exceeding a packet error rate (PER) threshold in the near future, enabling proactive channel switching decisions during operation. To make an informed decision on which channel to switch to, the Channel Quality List (CQL) model classifies candidate Wi-Fi channels in terms of the expected PER based on sensed radio activity.We evaluate this ML-aided proactive channel switching procedure through simulation of a mobile robotics use case in different interference scenarios. To generate realistic training data, a statistical interferer model has been developed, which generates dynamic traffic patterns and user behavior based on real-world measurements. This model captures the variability in possible interference scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training the ML models, and for evaluating the trained models during simulation.The proposed ML-aided channel switching approach allows the system to quickly switch away from a deteriorating channel quality before the QoS suffers, and to switch to the best channel in terms of PER. The prediction models improve the QoS considerably, where the Packet Error Rate (PER) is reduced by up to 99 % of the PER of a non-switching system in the best cases, and by 95 % even in very difficult scenarios. This work highlights the substantial benefits of employing ML for predictive channel switching in Wi-Fi systems, offering a robust solution to the growing challenge of interference in congested radio environments."

    "abstract": "The global energy transition is driving large-scale development of renewable energy(RE), with high-voltage direct current transmission from large RE bases becoming a typical approach for RE consumption. However, the strong fluctuation and intermittency of RE lead to persistently high curtailment rates, while also facing source-load mismatches and low RE utilization efficiency. Studying the matching relationship between RE output and load (source-load matching) can fully leverage the complementarity among different RE sources and their positive correlation with load patterns, thereby mitigating source-load mismatch issues. This study proposes a dynamic source-load matching method incorporating time-varying coefficients and establishes a two-stage low-carbon economic capacity planning model for large-scale RE bases, taking into account both planning and operational aspects. Additionally, this research systematically models Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants and analyzes the capability of CSP technology to enhance system flexibility. The proposed model effectively mitigates deviations between energy supply and demand, thereby improving RE utilization efficiency, reducing curtailment rates, and offering systematic solutions to resolve source-load mismatches."

    "abstract": "Urban mobility plays a significant role as the backbone of social and economic growth. However, the high urban mobility that corresponds with high population growth increases vehicle volume. Consequently, the road capacity cannot accommodate the overloaded vehicle volume, resulting in traffic congestion at various levels. Therefore, as an effort to improve human commuting life, this paper proposes a two-stage LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) framework for binary-class traffic forecasting based on time series data. The proposed algorithm constructs an LSTM model to capture the temporal dependencies embedded in sequence vehicle count data, and a LightGBM algorithm is employed for classifying the traffic state into two binary classes: Dense Traffic and Normal Traffic. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an RMSE and MAE of less than 0.2, indicating a time series prediction with minimal error. From a classification perspective, the proposed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 83.4%, outperforming other machine learning algorithms."

    "abstract": "The traditional deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) is renowned for its excellent performance, quick reaction, simplicity, and ease of use. DPCC, on the other hand, is extremely sensitive to changes in machine parameters, and when model parameters diverge from the real values, performance suffers greatly. This issue is particularly pronounced in permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors (PMASRMs), where the inductance decreases as the current increases. As a result, the DPCC method, which typically measures motor inductance under no-load conditions, will encounter considerable performance degradation with increasing current levels. In order to address this problem, this work proposes a DPCC approach based on the ultra-local model, which only uses system input and output and does not require motor parameter information, hence improving control system robustness. Additionally, to enable real-time motor inductance identification, an improved high-frequency current injection method is put forward, which introduces a current harmonic amplitude extraction link and replaces the low-pass filter with average value filter. By using this method, the accuracy and convergence rate of inductance identification can be greatly enhanced. Finally, the efficacy of the suggested control strategy for PMASRM is confirmed by comparison of simulations."

A dual-band comfort model is implemented using soft constraints to balance occupant comfort and electricity cost while ensuring solution’s feasibility. The proposed framework is tested in a simulation environment that emulates the electrical and thermal behavior of a real residential building equipped with a heat-pump system.

    "abstract": "With the increasing frequency of the global communication, the demand for high-precision, low-latency cross-language real-time information transmission system budget method is constantly increasing. In the distributed multi-node Japanese simultaneous interpretation system, this is a reality due to network delay, asynchronous sampling, node hardware differences and environmental noise. Therefore, the synchronization problem of multiple speech streams has become a key factor affecting the accuracy and comprehensibility of translation. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-node speech stream synchronization algorithm (AMSS). The core of this research is to solve the speech stream synchronization problem in a distributed environment. This method transforms the speech stream synchronization problem into a multi-objective optimization problem through mathematical modeling and comprehensively considers the time deviation between nodes, spectrum changes and cross-node interference. The purpose of this optimization is to minimize the global synchronization error. The core of the algorithm proposed by Fang includes: (1) discrete wavelet denoising based on waveform domain features. This can ensure the consistency of multi-node signals; (2) introducing a multi-head attention mechanism to capture the cross-node time dependency. This can achieve dynamic delay compensation and signal alignment; (3) constructing a global delay optimization model. This can update the node parameters through gradient descent iteration to take into account the asynchronous characteristics and cross-node noise interference. To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, this paper constructed the MN-JSI dataset. This dataset simulates a real-world distributed environment with varying node numbers, sampling rate drift, network jitter, and noise interference. Experimental results show that, compared to a Synchformer-style approach, AMSS reduces synchronization error from 22.1 ms to 12.6 ms, and downstream speech recognition error rate from 10.7% to 9.3%, with a latency of 58 ms, maintaining near-real-time processing capabilities. Furthermore, AMSS demonstrates enhanced robustness under varying signal-to-noise ratios and packet loss scenarios. Specifically, in a 16-node scenario, it maintains a synchronization error of approximately 20 ms, demonstrating its scalability and cross-node information fusion capabilities."

    "abstract": "A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that enables a person to interact directly with an external device without relying on muscles, voice, or physical movement. One such intermediate device is the Electroencephalogram (EEG), which captures electrical activity in the brain through Motor Imagery variables or imagined movements. The problem lies in translating Motor Imagery variables from EEG signals when imagining movements such as the right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue. An effective classification method must be able to represent the spatial relationship between EEG channels and the temporal sequence of signals. Previous studies used convolutional methods, such as CNN, RNN, or a hybrid of both, in Motor Imagery classification. However, this method has limitations in capturing spatial relationships between EEG channels or the sequence of time series only. The transformer model for sequential data is less efficient in processing long-duration EEG signals. Therefore, this study aims to develop a Motor Imagery EEG classification model comprising four classes: right hand, left hand, feet, and tongue, by leveraging the advantages of Wavelet and a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Mamba architecture. GNN models the spatial relationships between EEG channels in the form of a graph, while Mamba learns temporal patterns efficiently through a State Space Model (SSM) approach. The results of this study, with a final average accuracy of 82.05%, are expected to enhance the performance of Motor Imagery classification, supporting the development of a more adaptive and stable Brain-Computer Interface, which is crucial for real-time applications."

Recent advances have introduced uncertain topological features for tensor field ensembles by focusing on degenerate tensor locations. Yet, mode surfaces, including neutral surfaces and arbitrary mode surfaces are essential to a comprehensive understanding of tensor field topology. In this work, we present a generalization of uncertain degenerate tensor features to uncertain mode surfaces of arbitrary mode values, encompassing uncertain degenerate tensor lines as a special case. Our approach supports both surface and line geometries, forming a unified framework for analyzing uncertain mode-based topological features in tensor field ensembles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several real-world simulation datasets from engineering and materials science."

Secondly, the Quality Scoring Index (QSI) is introduced, the mapping relationship between parameters and performance is established through regression analysis, and the combination of coding parameters is optimized using linear regression and machine learning methods. Finally, the time-frequency domain noise features are extracted based on STFT, the noise types are identified by combining the minimum statistics algorithm with peak detection, the narrowband noise is suppressed by IIR trap filter, the background noise is eliminated by Wiener filter, and the transient noise is handled by adaptive thresholding.

    "abstract": "Agar as a renewable resource, which is easy to obtain, inexpensive, biocompatible, has strong anti-interference ability, good stability and excellent humidity linear response, making it suitable for the sensing field. Given that moisture absorption can cause swelling in materials sensitive composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), the stability of the QCM humidity sensor is compromised under high humidity (97% RH) and may even stops vibrating. In this study, agar was introduced into the cellulose nanocrystal matrix material to form a cellulose nanocrystal/agar (CNCs/Agar) sensitive membrane material through hydrogen bonding. The research results indicate that the addition of agar can improve the linearity of pure CNCs humidity sensor and expand the detection humidity range to 97% RH. The response value is -8655 Hz at 97% RH and the logarithmic linear relationship is R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>=0.99914. The sensitivity is significantly improved to 84.95 Hz/% RH, demonstrating good repeatability and long-term stability, indicating promising application prospects in the field of humidity detection."

    "abstract": "In solar energy systems, accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is intricately linked to meteorological factors. Day-ahead prediction based on similar weather scenarios is pivotal for enhancing forecasting performance. However, existing approaches are constrained by simplistic similar sample selection methods, inefficient utilization of PV datasets, and inadequate attention to generation uncertainty. This study proposes a day-ahead probabilistic forecasting model that improves input quality via a high-resolution multidimensional adaptive similar moment selection. In addition a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) learns the joint distribution of historical measurements and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reducing redundancy and enriching training data. The model employs a multibranch architecture, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks for spatio-temporal feature extraction. It also leverages Quantile Regression with Kernel Density Estimation to generate multiquantile predictions and comprehensive probability distributions. Experiments on authentic PV datasets demonstrate that the proposed GAN-QRCNLSTM model outperforms baseline models, achieving superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in complex weather conditions such as extreme weather scenario."

    "abstract": "One of the key front-end technologies in spatial audio reproduction is the extraction of primary components, which provide auditory cues, and ambient components, which contribute to the atmospheric qualities of stereo recordings. Primary-ambient extraction (PAE) algorithms rely on specific assumptions about the stereo signal model. However, the primary and ambient components extracted by state-of-the-art algorithms often fail to satisfy these assumptions fully. In this paper, we propose a new PAE algorithm called APEC (Ambient Phase Estimation with Correlation constraints), which is grounded in the assumption of uncorrelated primary and ambient components. The APEC algorithm demonstrates higher extraction accuracy and higher diffuseness accuracy than existing methods. Furthermore, we incorporate a timeshift preprocessing step to mitigate degradation caused by time differences in the primary components. Both objective and subjective evaluations confirm the algorithm's superior performance, highlighting accurate primaryambient extraction while preserving diffuseness."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) system, which is designed to operate without the need of using a cyclic prefix (CP) in the transmitted signals. The CP-free ODDM is enabled by exploiting the unique structures of the ODDM prototype pulses, which are constructed through repetitions of finite-duration elementary pulses. The system eliminates the need of CP by designing a new receiving filter through temporally extending the transmission prototype pulse. The elementary pulse repetition at the transmitter along with the temporal filter extension at the receiver introduce a wrap-around effect in the equivalent channel spreading function in the dealy-Doppler (DD) domain. The wrap-around effect leads to a block-circulant-like structure of the DD-domain channel matrix that is the same as conventional ODDM systems with CP. Thus CP-free ODDM can employ the same receiver as conventional ODDM systems, yet it yields a higher energy efficiency as no energy needs to be allocated for CP symbols. The wrap-around effects are theoretically demonstrated by deriving the exact analytical expressions of the cross-ambiguity functions of practical transmission and receiving prototype pulses. In addition, theoretical analysis of the cross-ambiguity function verifies that the CP-free ODDM waveforms satisfy local bi-orthogonality in the delay and Doppler domains. This bi-orthogonality property along with the wrap-around effects of the channel spreading function enables the design of a low complexity iterative receiver, which performs interference cancellation and coherent matrix combining (CMC) in the delay domain and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detection in the Doppler domain. The proposed receiver can collect the diversity in both the delay and Doppler domains while simultaneously suppressing the negative impacts of DD-domain intersymbol interference (ISI) introduced by the doubly-selective fading channels."

Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we outline open challenges to inspire future research."

Two practical pinching-antenna configuration strategies are considered, namely <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiple-time discrete activation</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">one-off continuous sliding</i>. For each strategy, the capacity and rate regions are characterized under the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes, respectively. 1) For NOMA, the capacity region achieved by the discrete activation is first characterized. In particular, the ideal case with the infinite number of activation times is considered, where the optimal PA activation and resource allocation scheme is derived. It is shown that different user groups or decoding orders are served via time-sharing. Inspired by this result, an inner bound of capacity region is obtained for the practical case with a finite number of activation times. Then, for the continuous sliding case, the inner bound of capacity region is characterized by alternately optimizing the resource allocation and PAs’ continuous positions. 2) For OMA, the rate region is first obtained for the discrete activation case. It is unveiled that multiple users are successively served. Then, by alternately optimizing the resource allocation and PAs’ continuous positions, the inner bound of rate region is obtained for the continuous sliding case. Numerical results demonstrate that i) PASS can significantly improve the capacity performance compared with the conventional fixed-antenna systems; ii) the capacity gain can be further enhanced by using the proposed PA activation and sliding and resource allocation schemes; and iii) the continuous sliding has the potential to outperform the discrete activation in NOMA, whereas the latter performs better in OMA."

Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes."

However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, automatically generate annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an exvivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest PSNR (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%."

    "abstract": "Flood depth mapping is critical for effective flood management, disaster response, and hydrodynamic model validation/calibration. The bathtub approach that generates flood depth by overlapping remotely sensed flood extent on high-resolution (HR) topography can provide flood depth over vast areas at low cost. However, only a handful such algorithms are available. And none considers the topographic heterogeneity at small-scale and have poor tolerance to input errors. On the other hand, the spatial pattern of inundation can be well explained by the small-scale features only visible from Very High-Resolution (VHR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 1 ~\\mathrm{m})$</tex> topography. To address these challenges, we developed an Emulated Flood Recession Algorithm (EFRA) that physically considers both macro and micro topographic characteristics. Besides the depth value, EFRA also outputs the uncertainty of the estimation. Validated against USGS High Water Marks (HWMs), EFRA yields an RMSE of 1.01 m for depth estimation when 1 m DEM is used. But the error is amplified to 2.83 m when using a 10 m DEM instead. The proposed flood depth estimator could significantly promote the current operational Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) systems."

    "abstract": "Parallel back-to-back converters are highly demanded in many high-power applications such as adjustable speed drive (ASD) systems, which reduce harmonics and improve the power factor and reliability compared to single two-level converters. It is evident that common-mode voltage (CMV) is the root cause of many challenges in ASD systems, such as shaft voltage and bearing damage, which may reduce equipment lifespan. On the other hand, Zero Sequence Circulating Current (ZSCC) leads to an additional current of switches which increases power loss and decreases the current capacity of converters. Simultaneous reduction of these two critical issues has to be considered in any switching strategy. In this regard, this paper presents a switching strategy based on a modified three-level space vector modulation scheme, which completely eliminates the common-mode voltage (CMV = 0 V). Moreover, the proposed switching sequence keeps the ZSCC within a low-amplitude and fully symmetric ripple, ensuring controlled circulating-current behavior without requiring any additional hardware. The method also generates a three-level line voltage and achieves an input-current THD of 3.92%. The simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "This work reports a negative photoconductivity short-wave infrared detector based on high-Sn-content germanium-tin (GeSn) alloys. GeSn thin films with a Sn composition as high as 25.2% are achieved on InP substrates via molecular beam epitaxy. This material exhibits an ultrahigh absorption rate of 95.94% across the mid-to-far infrared spectrum (2–18 μm). Its direct bandgap characteristic (0.36 ± 0.02 eV) is confirmed using the Tauc model. Innovatively, by manipulating deep-level trap states, the Negative photoconductivity effect is realized for the first time in a GeSn detector. Under illumination, trap states selectively capture photogenerated holes to form positive charge centers. These centers subsequently trap electrons and accelerate their recombination via Coulomb interaction, thereby significantly reducing the device conductivity. The vertically structured detector designed based on this mechanism achieves record-high responsivity (2.61 A/W) and external quantum efficiency (208.8%) at a wavelength of 1550 nm under a -2 V bias, representing a 65.3-fold enhancement over the highest previously reported values for GeSn detectors. The device simultaneously demonstrates low dark current (5.18 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup> A) and strong size dependence. Through a synergistic strategy of “material growth – defect engineering – band structure modulation,” this work overcomes the inherent limitations of high dark current and responsivity degradation in conventional GeSn detectors. It thereby establishes a new paradigm for high-performance mid-infrared detection, photonic neuromorphic computing, and intelligent sensing systems."

    "abstract": "River ice is closely related to hydrological processes, water resource utilization, river hydraulic projects, and navigation systems, and the spatial distribution extent of river ice serves as critical foundational data for studying river ice. The Three Rivers Source Region (TRSR) is a representative high and cold mountain; in this region, river ice is well developed and significantly impacts the river runoff process. However, river ice data in this region are scarce, seriously limiting related research. In this study, a 30-meter spatial resolution river ice extent dataset (1990-2023) for the TRSR was successfully developed by employing the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat imagery, achieving an overall accuracy of 97.96% and a kappa coefficient of 0.86. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor images resulted in the highest mapping accuracy, followed by the Thematic Mapper (TM) images and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) images. Notably, in areas with different elevations, slopes, and aspects, the mapping accuracy did not significantly differ. This dataset reveals, for the first time, that the average area of river ice distributed in the TRSR was 2073.0 km2, with a coverage rate of 0.64%, indicating a noticeable downward trend. Additionally, the river ice extent became more fragmented, and river ice was distributed more significantly in high-altitude regions and areas with gentle slopes than in other areas. However, no obvious characteristics regarding the slope aspect of the river ice distribution were observed. This research provides a comprehensive technical framework for large-scale river ice extraction using the GEE platform, and it offers an understanding of the distribution features and changes in river ice in the TRSR and even the broader Tibetan Plateau."

    "abstract": "In smart cities, sustainable resource management is crucial for preserving environmental integrity and improving economic efficiency. One of the most serious concerns is wastewater recycling, which generally depends on old, energy-intensive processes. To solve this problem, AI-powered systems, notably those incorporating Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), provide a potential solution. This paper addresses the integration of ANN in improving wastewater recycling operations within smart city infrastructure. Using ANN's capacity to learn from big datasets, such systems may dramatically boost the accuracy of real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and effective resource allocation. The ANN-based model incorporates data from numerous sensors that monitor crucial characteristics such as water quality, flow rates, and energy usage. Continuous learning allows the system to discover trends, foresee prospective concerns, and deliver actionable insights to decrease operating costs and environmental consequences. Additionally, predictive maintenance offered by ANN aids in avoiding downtime and ensuring the system functions at top performance. By incorporating AI and ANN into wastewater recycling systems, smart cities may achieve a more sustainable approach to managing water resources. This study addresses the possible advantages of this integration, including increased system dependability, resource efficiency, and a decrease in the total environmental impact."

    "abstract": "As more logistics systems adopt AI for autonomy, it has become necessary to find solutions that balance cost, energy efficiency, and timely delivery. Traditional algorithms have difficulty working in changing and complex environments because they are not flexible enough to deal with several goals. The study has been designed to build a hybrid algorithm based on Bat Algorithm (BA) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) to make the route optimization process more efficient for autonomous logistics. Thanks to its approach of taking advantages of both BA and FA, the HBFO algorithm can keep a good balance between exploring and exploiting possible solutions. A multi-objective model is developed to decrease the distance traveled, the energy used, and the operation’s expenses. Solomon VRPTW was used for experiments as well as a real-time SmartCitySim dataset. Some examples of metrics are total distance, the energy used, the time you are traveling, and the hypervolume for measuring diversity. From the results, HBFO is better in each metric as compared to standard GA, PSO, BA, and FA. When compared to the best-performing algorithm (BA), HBFO is able to cut route distance by 7.2%, use less energy by 8.1%, and take less time to run by 13.7%. The Pareto front in the hypervolume result of 0.88 is well grouped and varied. With the use of this framework, AI-driven logistics can enjoy more sustainability, efficiency, and improved performance."

    "abstract": "Offside decisions in football often spark debates and controversies due to the rapid movement of players and the ball, as well as the limited capacity of referees to observe dynamic match situations accurately. These errors can significantly affect fairness and match outcomes. Although the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system has been introduced to assist referees, it still relies heavily on manual interpretation, which is prone to bias and inconsistency. To address these challenges, this study presents the development of an automatic offside detection system using the YOLOv11 object detection model. Two variants-YOLOv11 Nano (YOLOv11n) and YOLOv11 Small (YOLOv11s)-are evaluated for their effectiveness in detecting offside situations. The methodology includes dataset preparation by collecting and annotating football footage, followed by model training and evaluation. Both models are assessed based on mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95), inference speed, and robustness across different match scenarios. Experimental results show that YOLOv11n achieves higher detection accuracy, while YOLOv11s demonstrates greater stability across varied conditions. As the first study to apply YOLOv11 for automatic offside detection in football, this research highlights the novelty of integrating state-of-the-art object detection into officiating. The comparative insights between YOLOv11n and YOLOv11s provide valuable guidance for future applications of AI in sports analytics, aiming to enhance fairness, objectivity, and efficiency in referee decision-making."

We compare three rule-based controllers (fuzzy, PI, and PID), a model-predictive controller (MPC), and four advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms (A2C, DDPG, PPO, and SAC) in a 1R1C thermal building model with continuous heating and cooling control. The model captures nonlinear thermal dynamics using Euler discretization, models sensor uncertainties as reflected Wiener processes and integrates dynamic electricity tariffs. We define single-objective (temperature) and multi-objective tasks that minimize thermal discomfort and energy costs. An extensive ablation study identifies the best performing RL algorithm configuration that reduces cost by 6% compared to rule-based controllers, outperforms MPC by 1% and underperforms MPC with perfect prediction by less than 4%."

As decentralization efforts increase, MVAC grids become saturated, necessitating expansion to maintain stability and efficiency. This study examines two possible expansion strategies: reinforcing the existing MVAC infrastructure or transitioning to a hybrid network incorporating medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) links. A key focus is on frequency stability, specifically the impact on the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and nadir during primary frequency response. To address this, small-signal models are developed and validated, enabling sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters that influence RoCoF and nadir. These models are further validated through Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations to demonstrate their accuracy and reliability. An assessment was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of MVDC integration in improving frequency stability relative to traditional MVAC expansion."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of the coupling between phase-angle and voltage dynamics in hybrid power systems integrated with grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters through the extended damping redistribution theory. Due to the differing synchronization dynamics of GFM and GFL devices, the conventional frameworks derived from GFM systems fail to adequately address emerging stability risks caused by angle-voltage coupling in hybrid systems. To bridge this gap, a causal approximation technique is developed to invert the input-output relationship of GFL dynamics, enabling a unified modeling framework for hybrid devices. Then, the study extends the damping redistribution theory to hybrid systems by deriving explicit quantification for total system damping and its dispersion. It is discovered that the damping redistribution mechanism of angle-voltage coupling dynamics still works in hybrid systems. Specifically, the coupling worsens the stability not by changing the total damping, but by redistributing it more dispersively. The proposed methodology is validated through numerical simulations on an IEEE 14-bus system, demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying angle-voltage coupling dynamics and implications for stability analysis."

Central to our approach is a stagewise refinement algorithm, inspired by optimal transport theory. This algorithm constructs non-symmetric multi-stage scenario trees through clustering methods and is benchmarked in a simulation on the Belgian real-time balancing market with a battery energy storage system. Results demonstrate that our approach, particularly when combined with k-means clustering, yields higher profits compared to traditional multi-stage reduction techniques."

An experimental device for crushing concrete using high voltage pulsed was produced by HUST. In order to analyze the disintegration mechanism of concrete sample under the high voltage pulse, this paper uses X-ray CT to examine how discharge channels grow within sample during high voltage pulse fragmentation. The discharge channels have a 'trunk-branch' spatial distribution characteristic. Due to the differing electrical properties of aggregates and cement mortar, primarily manifested in their relative permittivity, the electric field strength changes abruptly at their interface. Consequently, discharge channels always propagate along the aggregate surface. This liberation mechanism enables the high voltage pulse crushing process to achieve a higher degree of dissociation than traditional mechanical methods, while preserving the complete structural morphology of the aggregate within the concrete sample."

An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the charging cost and peak load by introducing preference-based indexes for the incentives.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the scattering analysis with the Electric-Field Integral Equation of perfectly conducting objects has been carried out through divergence-conforming schemes of discretization, which are numerically convenient because the dominant Kernel contributions are weakly singular. Since the divergence-conforming sets enforce by definition the continuity of the normal component of the expanded magnitudes through the edges arising from the discretization, the analysis can only be applied to objects conformally meshed, with adjacent facets sharing a single edge. In practice, this hampers the flexible analysis of complex structures, which very often need to be modelled through the interconnection of independent meshes. In this paper, we introduce two novel schemes of discretization of the Electric-Field Integral Equation that are based on the expansion of the current through a hierarchical rearrangement of the monopolar-RWG expansion of the current (fully discontinuous at edges). Both schemes manage the zeroth-order scheme of testing in the same manner. The first-order testing scheme, though, is implemented differently in both cases, either through volumetric or through surface testing integrals. We show with RCS-results the accuracy of the proposed schemes in the analysis of a sharp-edged perfectly conducting object."

This paper proposes a cost-effective approach to enhancing health data security by integrating blockchain technology with the existing relational database management system (DBMS) used in the Teman Mas Abdi application at the Kediri Regency Health Office. In the proposed hybrid architecture, public data such as health facility profiles is maintained in the DBMS, while sensitive private data, including electronic medical records, is stored on a blockchain using BigchainDB. This design enables encryption, immutability, and patient-centric control over personal data. System testing demonstrates that the integration preserves existing infrastructure, minimizes financial overhead, and complies with Indonesia's Ministry of Health Regulation No. 24 of 2022 concerning electronic medical records."

This work explores the use of iodine in an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Acceleration (ECRA) thruster originally designed for xenon. Thrust, specific impulse, and efficiency were measured using a Faraday probe for iodine and other propellants. The results, however subject to large uncertainties due to the estimation method of ion energy, demonstrate the similar behavior of ECRA thruster between iodine and xenon.

Traditional manual UI testing approaches are time-consuming and error-prone, particularly as web applications scale. While automated testing has emerged as a solution, existing methods rely heavily on brittle element locators such as CSS selectors and XPath expressions, which are vulnerable to structural changes in web applications. This paper presents EmbedRank-LM, a novel approach for web element identification using natural language descriptions to reduce dependency on conventional element locators in automated UI testing. The proposed method employs a two-stage process: first, a sentence embedding model selects the top-k candidate elements with the highest semantic similarity to the input description; second, a large language model performs final element selection from the candidate set. An experimental evaluation on a dataset of 300 samples derived from Pasupat et al.'s benchmark demonstrates that EmbedRank-LM achieves 67% accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods, including Trinh et al. (42.67%) and AgentQL (59.67%). While EmbedRank-LM exhibits a longer execution time compared to baseline approaches, it demonstrates a substantially lower execution cost, being 18 times more cost-effective than AgentQL, and establishes an advantageous trade-off between accuracy, processing time, and computational cost for practical UI testing applications."

By constructing a layered container model (basic mirror layer, application layer and service instance layer), this method combines the multi-satellite cooperative migration mechanism and the dynamic priority pre-migration strategy to realize the efficient cooperation between lightweight mirror transmission and state hot migration. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional full migration, this method reduces the task interruption time by more than 80%, improves the task success rate by 40%, and optimizes the utilization ratio of network and computing resources by 20% and 15% respectively. The research results provide theoretical and technical support for the task continuity guarantee of LEO satellite network, and are especially suitable for real-time task scenarios such as communication and remote sensing."

    "abstract": "Accurate surface flow measurement is critical for environmental sensing systems, particularly in automated river discharge monitoring. While vision-based optical flow techniques offer non-contact advantages over physical sensors, their reliability in field deployments is compromised by natural illumination variations such as dynamic shadows, reflections, and solar glare. Existing feature detection algorithms require manual threshold adjustments under changing light conditions, undermining automation in hydrological applications. This study proposes an illumination-adaptive Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) framework integrating global Kapur-Sahoo-Wong (KSW) entropy-driven threshold optimization with localized contrast evaluation and Harris corner response filtering. The method dynamically adjusts detection parameters through hybrid threshold fusion, spatial homogenization, and eigenvalue-based geometric stability analysis. Experimental validation on 7,500 river surface images demonstrates 94% detection accuracy under stable lighting, sustaining 82% precision and 68% recall in severe glare conditions. Compared to conventional Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) , and Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) detectors, the approach reduces edge false alarms by 40–60% and triples valid feature density in low-visibility regions. By eliminating manual calibration and enhancing robustness to photometric interference, this framework enables reliable optical flow tracking for continuous discharge measurement, advancing automated hydrological monitoring through environmental adaptability and computational efficiency."

In the original PSO, the control parameters decide the performance of the algorithm. In present studies, researchers often used distance as the assessment criterion, which brings a dimensional ambiguity and ignores the consideration of the searching direction. To solve this issue, a directional scale-based cosine similarity indicator (DSCSI) has been proposed. This improvement enables the controller to achieve rational adjustments based on the unique directional differences in populations. The proposed indicator was applied in adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and tested on CEC2014 with different dimensional information, compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms. The results of the comparison show that the directional scale-based adaptive particle swarm optimization (DSAPSO) has better performance as the dimension increases than the traditional distance-based APSO."

    "abstract": "Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, offshore infrastructure inspection, and defense applications. However, existing communication technologies for UIoT predominantly rely on acoustic channels, which suffer from high latency, limited bandwidth, and significant energy consumption. Although its data rates are higher, optical communication is badly limited by the limited range of transmission and its susceptibility to turbidity. In order to address these restrictions, this paper introduces a new Hybrid Acoustic-Optical Communication Technique that aims to reach extreme low-latency and high-reliability communication in underwater IoT networks. The suggested solution utilizes the acoustic connection as long-range (low-bandwidth) control signaling and applies dynamic integration of optical channels as short-range (high-throughput) data communications. A real-time channel quality estimation-based adaptive switching algorithm provides ideal usage of the two mediums. The findings of the simulations prove that the hybrid scheme is able to considerably decrease the end-to-end latency, maximize the throughput, as well as extend the lifetime of the network, relative to the traditional acoustic-only systems. This paper establishes the groundwork of the next-generation underwater IoT architectures that can be used to support intelligent and delay-sensitive applications within a dynamic marine system."

Accurate price forecasting is a critical aspect of agricultural economics as it enables farmers, policymakers, and retailers to make informed decisions about pricing, distribution, and crop management to increase the efficiency of the agricultural sector. Given the rise to the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, the time series models have emerged as essential tools for predicting vegetable prices. These models can capture the dynamic nature of price fluctuations and help predict future prices accurately. The prediction of vegetable prices in Karachi, Pakistan, has not been extensively researched, prompting the need for further investigation in this area. To address this gap, the following research paper is developed, which aims to conduct a thorough analysis of various time series models, with particular focus on the comparative analysis of SARIMA and LSTM to determine the most effective and accurate model for forecasting future vegetable prices in Karachi, Pakistan. With an aim to analyze two very different time-series approaches for vegetable price prediction and choosing the most efficient one, this paper endorses that LSTM performs better when dealing with large datasets and complex non-linear patterns in price fluctuations."

    "abstract": "Photonic tensor cores have grown in popularity over the past few years for accelerating tensor-based kernels found in abundance in deep learning workloads because they offer potentially massive spatial parallelism (across wavelengths and waveguides), subnanosecond-scale start-to-solution latency, and near-dissipation-free dynamic operation. However, several shortcomings severely limit the practically achievable parallelism, processing throughput, and energy efficiency in existing photonic tensor core architectures. For instance, the wavelength-selective analog operation of existing designs makes them highly prone to crosstalk noise and other optical signal penalties and losses. These penalties and losses interplay with an already tight optical power budget, leading to strong trade-offs for achievable spatial parallelism, operating data rate, and analog precision. This paper shows how co-designing low-dissipation, low-noise, and high-speed electro-photonic devices, crosstalk-minimal circuit organizations, and mixed unary/analog signaling methods can overcome these shortcomings to realize photonic tensor cores with scaled-up throughput and operational energy-efficiency benefits for accelerating a variety of deep learning workloads."

This study aims to implement the T5-small model to generate meta descriptions and evaluate the model's performance in generating SEO meta descriptions. The method used is fine-tuning the small variant of the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model on a large-scale Indonesian news dataset (Liputan6). This model is trained to summarize abstract texts, with the results formatted as meta descriptions. Quantitative evaluation of the test data shows promising performance, with a ROUGE-1 score of 34.09, a ROUGE-2 score of 18.67, and a ROUGE-L score of 29.37.

We have compared the performance of three networks, where one is trained with eccentric circular cylinders, one with elliptic cylinders, and one with data from both the previous datasets. We could observe that the networks trained with data from elliptic cylinders are the ones providing the most general results, with up to 16.6 % of maximum observed error, and are able to provide good performance in structures not part of the datasets, such as eccentric cylinders.

Seasonal disease outbreaks and inadequate infrastructure in isolated areas frequently result in antimalarial medication shortages. For rural clinics, we offer an intelligent logistics framework that systematically predicts demand and schedules medication distribution. Our methodology combines a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for adaptive routing under uncertainty, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based supply-chain optimiser, and a multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for demand prediction. By taking geography, vehicle capacities, cold-chain restrictions, and seasonal malaria patterns into consideration, the system simultaneously reduces delivery time and cost while avoiding stockouts. Our model architectures, training protocols, and data sources are all thoroughly described. Real-world data from 247 rural health facilities spread across six African nations (Kenya, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia) over 24 months is used for experimental validation. Our method reduces average delivery time by 42%, total distribution cost by 28%, and stockout incidents by 34% when compared to a traditional static planning baseline. The normalised error metric for demand forecasts is 92.1%, which is a considerable improvement over the 67.3% accuracy of basic methods. These improvements are highly significant, according to statistical tests (p<0.01). These findings show that antimalarial medication delivery in underserved areas can be significantly enhanced by a fully integrated AI-driven pipeline."

This paper presents a fuzzy logic-based mechanism that adapts game scenarios in response to individual learners' development of soft skills. In particular, the fuzzy logic model represents the ambiguity inherent in evaluating the acquisition of soft skills and provides adaptivity accordingly. Adaptivity is achieved through the automatic selection of the next game task to be delivered to players based on their level of soft skill acquisition. This mechanism has been embedded into EPATHLO, an intelligent educational adventure game designed to teach the HTML programming language and essential soft skills. Real users have utilized EPATHLO, and corresponding case studies are presented.

    "abstract": "Speculative execution attacks exploit malicious speculation to leak sensitive data via microarchitectural covert channels. Speculative Taint Tracking (STT) is a state-of-the-art hardware mechanism that blocks such threats by tainting data flowing from speculative loads, untainting data once all its dependencies are not speculative, and delaying instructions that create covert channels until their inputs are untainted. However, STT's hardware feasibility remains unclear due to a lack of detailed hardware cost analysis. This paper presents the first in-depth hardware cost analysis of STT and identifies two key challenges: (1) the logic delay of taint propagation, which grows with rename width, and (2) area overhead from instruction delaying, which requires expensive CAM-style logic to enforce speculation safety. To address these, we propose a new microarchitecture for STT, called <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mu$</tex> STT. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mu$</tex> STT is based on two new mechanisms. First, the Age Matrix is a shallow taint propagation circuit that removes 85% of the logic delay overhead of prior STT designs, while only adding 36 % more area at the default rename width of 8. Second, the impede micro-op implements instruction delaying in a fashion that increases STT's performance overhead by only 5 percentage points (from 16 % to 21 %), while replacing bespoke STT hardware with existing RAW dependency tracking. Together, these contributions reduce STT's hardware complexity and cost in the context of high-end wide-issue processor designs."

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for on-device AI, increasing efforts have been directed toward deploying lightweight small-scale large language models (sLLMs) on edge and mobile devices to enhance inference performance while minimizing computational cost and latency. As the number of decoder layers in sLLMs decreases, the embedding layer constitutes a substantial portion of the model's overall parameters and memory consumption. Consequently, efficient data compression is crucial; however, existing methods, such as quantization and pruning, drastically degrade accuracy when applied to the error-sensitive embedding layers. Moreover, embedding layer computations exhibit low arithmetic intensity (operations per byte), rendering them memory-bound. This limitation necessitates a shift from conventional von Neumann architectures to processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes (1) XOR-based Masking Compression (XMC), a lossless compression algorithm specialized for sLLM embedding layers, and (2) PriME, which integrates XMC with PIM architecture to alleviate memory bottlenecks in embedding layers. XMC enhances zero-bit representation in 16-bit FP data using ADD and XOR masking, achieving an average compression ratio of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.49 \\times$</tex> while being implementable with a 3-cycle decompression delay. PriME enables parallel processing of compressed data within PIM, accelerating embedding computations by an average of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.0 \\times$</tex> and up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.26 \\times$</tex> compared to GPUs, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by over 30 %, leading to an average energy efficiency improvement of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6.29 \\times$</tex>.

    "abstract": "Quantum circuits are the fundamental representation of quantum algorithms and constitute valuable intellectual property (IP). Multiple quantum circuit obfuscation (QCO) techniques have been proposed in prior research to protect quantum circuit IP against malicious compilers. However, there has not been a thorough security evaluation of these schemes. In this work, we investigate the resilience of split compilation against an oracle-guided attack. Split compilation is one of the most studied QCO techniques, where the circuit to be compiled is split into two disjoint partitions. Each split circuit is known to the compiler, but the interconnections between them are hidden. We propose an oracle-guided security evaluation framework in which candidate connections are systematically tested against inputoutput observations, with iteratively pruned inconsistent mappings. This hierarchical matching process exploits the reversibility of quantum gates and reduces the search space compared to brute-force enumeration. Experimental evaluation in the RevLib benchmark suite shows that only a small number of I/O pairs are sufficient to recover the correct inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuits. Our study marks the first thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and highlights the necessity of such evaluations in the development of new protection schemes."

In addition to providing accurate search results, trustworthy categorization is also necessary to support recommendation engines and enhance the general purchasing experience. We present a multimodal deep learning approach, in this study that uses a fusion-based model to merge structured attribute information with product images. To handle noisy and incomplete metadata, we apply preprocessing steps such as one-hot encoding and class balancing, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract rich visual features. Our experiments show that the fusion model consistently outperforms image-only and attribute-only baselines, reaching 84.2% ± 2.1 test accuracy and a macro F1-score of 0.87 across five folds. Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation helped the model generalize better and avoid overfitting.

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising method for enabling grid-interactive heating in buildings. However, deriving an accurate building model, which is a prerequisite for a successful implementation of MPC, hinders its widespread adoption. The present paper eliminates the need for building-specific modeling by developing an approximate MPC (AMPC) based on a neural network that emulates MPC behavior without requiring a building model. The AMPC is trained on data created by controlling the heating system of 16,000 building models with MPC in response to dynamic pricing. Utilizing data from diverse buildings forces the AMPC to learn building-agnostic decision-making, thereby enabling its application to buildings with unknown dynamics. The AMPC’s control performance is validated on 687 unseen building models for 25 weeks each across different climate zones. Compared to the MPC, 50% of the buildings, the AMPC achieves less than 7% excess cost and less than 2 Kh/d increase in thermal discomfort, while simultaneously reducing the computation time by 95%. For very well-insulated buildings that barely require heating, the AMPC incurs substantial relative cost increases, even though the absolute cost increases are most probably negligible."

We estimate lower bounds of total physical inertia on the Spanish power system, and use a swing-equation-based grid model to demonstrate how energy storage systems can offset inverse power responses from hydropower plants while simultaneously reducing cumulative control gate travel distance and improving system-wide frequency response."

The SPS serves as a probabilistic and quantitative representation of user sentiment, enabling more context-aware recommendations.

    "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence technology, autonomous driving has advanced significantly, and open-pit mining areas have emerged as one of the important scenarios for the implementation of autonomous driving in recent years. The perception module forms the foundation of the autonomous driving system for mining trucks, among which the detection of small obstacles such as stones and cones is crucial for ensuring driving safety. Currently, small obstacle detection faces problems such as small size, insufficient features, and complex backgrounds. Meanwhile, a single sensor is vulnerable to sensor failure and difficult to deal with occlusion and multi-source noise interference. To address these challenges, this article designs a novel algorithm framework based on feature fusion of LiDAR and camera, combining strategies such as multi-modal data augmentation, feature layer fusion, and temporal modeling to achieve high-precision detection of small obstacles. The problem of feature scarcity is alleviated through multi-scale feature extraction and cross-modal data augmentation, a feature fusion scheme is constructed based on the cross-attention mechanism, and a temporal self-attention mechanism is introduced to realize dynamic association of small obstacles in consecutive frames. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of $83.4 \\%$ and a NuScenes Detection Score (NDS) of $72.5 \\%$ on the self-built dataset. Compared with advanced methods, MSOD significantly improves detection accuracy for small obstacles."

This analysis guided the design of a photon scanning collimator. By scanning the top and lateral dead layers of the HPGe crystal using the collimator, the specific thickness and uniformity of the dead layers were determined. The acquired data were used to refine the MCNP model by incorporating the measured dead layer parameters. Experimental validation with standard point sources demonstrated that the root mean square (RMS) of the relative deviation between simulated and experimental detection efficiencies was less than 1%, confirming the accuracy of the proposed system and methodology for dead layer thickness measurement."

We assess packet-level delay, user denial, energy consumption, and infrastructure expansion. Results show that HAPS markedly reduce queuing delay and nearly eliminate user denial under moderate overload, while also lowering operational and capital expenditures by relieving congested BSs.

    "abstract": "To meet the increasing demand for higher storage density, modern NAND flash-based SSDs employ Quad-Level Cell (QLC) technology, which stores four bits per memory cell. However, it exacerbates the read disturb issue, where repeated read operations gradually shift the threshold voltages of unselected NAND flash cells. This voltage drift leads to frequent read retries and accelerates device wear, ultimately degrading performance and endurance. To address this issue, we propose Localized Page Allocation (LPA), a novel data mapping scheme that allocates each page to a restricted region of the wordline. LPA assigns four consecutive bits in a single page to a single cell. This approach confines read operations to a limited portion of the bitlines, thereby reducing the number of NAND flash cells exposed to read disturb. However, this localized access increases the complexity of sensing operations. To address this challenge, we introduce Progressive Voltage Convergence (PVC) method that adaptively determines the next sensing voltage for each bitline based on its previous sensing result. This fine-grained control reduces the number of sensing steps during read operations. For additional optimization, we employ lossless compression, which reduces the number of sensing steps for the compressed pages. Experimental evaluations using real-world workloads demonstrate that our design improves I/O performance by up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 1 \\%}$</tex> and extends endurance by 79% compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

    "abstract": "Navigating the burgeoning tourism industry which makes up 11.1% of global GDP in 2024 presents a unique challenge for group travel: orchestrating an itinerary that satisfies the diverse preferences, tastes, and budget constraints of multiple individuals. This activity of curating locations and creating an itinerary can be particularly tedious since sifting through multiple locations and activities is a time-consuming endeavor. Since tourists typically like to travel in groups, the interests of every individual of the group must be considered during itinerary planning. Most existing systems for itinerary recommendation and tourist-spot recommendation cater to individual travelers and fail to take such group dynamics into account, rendering them impractical for use in group excursions. In such a scenario satisfying every individual can be a complex task when various limitations like time, budget and travel constraints are considered. The study attempts to analyze, understand, and automate this using Graphical Neural Networks (GNN) and recommend tour itinerary based on history of place review which acts as an indicator of user preferences, integrating it with constraints to recommend a tour that complies with individual likings. Work proposes a unique ML model based on GNN and compares it with existing systems with documented results to find the suitability of GNN for group-tour recommendations. Furthermore, there is scarcity of data related to India-specific tourist destinations and their thematic categories. The proposed work also tries to create a standardized tourism dataset in Indian context, powered by YFCC100M that can be used for future studies."

Among LPWAN technologies, LoRaWAN is particularly well suited due to its energy efficiency and wide coverage. However, a major drawback of LoRa is its limited throughput. One of the constraints that reduce the throughput is the duplication of frames decoded by multiple gateways, resulting in redundant transmissions to the network server. To address this issue, we propose a distributed frame deduplication mechanism that offloads the conventional centralized deduplication process in LoRaWAN from the network server to the gateway side. Each gateway maintains a whitelist to determine which frames should be decoded and then transmitted to the network server. Our approach, thus, aims to eliminate redundant frames to be decoded at the gateways. Simulation results show that our approach increases the overall network throughput and the system efficiency (up to 94% compared to only 46% for LoRaWAN for dense networks)."

However, machine learning is affected by the limitations of hyperparameter adjustment, and it is difficult to complete the prediction task with higher accuracy at a high standard in specific scenarios. Based on this, this paper proposes an improved particle swarm algorithm to optimize the coupling model of BP neural network to improve the model performance and prediction accuracy. First, a particle swarm algorithm based on the theory of good point set and adaptive inertia weights is proposed, and 16 low-dimensional and highdimensional test functions are used to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm; on this basis, the improved algorithm is combined with BP neural network and applied to the power prediction dataset for power load prediction, and performance tests and algorithm comparisons are completed. The findings confirm that the improved particle swarm algorithm enhances the BP neural network model, outperforming the original in four key metrics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (60.324, 5355.1723, 73.179, 5.2465 %)(94.6607. 12735. 5187,112.8518,8.221 %), and the IPSO algorithm shows good convergence speed and accuracy as judged by the iterative curve.

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and their integration into electrical distribution grids present various challenges. Among others, the efficiency of bidirectional chargers is critical for accurate energy demand forecasting and charging schedule optimisation. This study adapts a mathematical efficiency model, originally developed for photovoltaic inverters, for application to bidirectional EV chargers and incorporates the charging operation into a distribution grid simulation. To account for the power-dependent efficiency of chargers under diverse charging conditions, an approximation based on a step-function is employed. Simulation results indicate that incorporating variable charger efficiency leads to a moderate increase in total EV energy demand (9.4 %) and a minor increase in transformer loading during charging events (0.4 %), while the impact on line loading remains negligible in the considered scenario. The developed variable efficiency model provides a foundation for future research in larger networks with higher EV penetration levels also incorporating functionalities such as Vehicle-to-Grid."

    "abstract": "Heart-related health problems are a growing concern, with increasing rates being observed across various demographics. Early detection of these abnormalities is vital, as some can indicate life-threatening conditions if left untreated. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a primary device used to discover patterns within the heart’s electrical signals, which can be analyzed to identify anomalies. Arrhythmia is one such anomaly that can range from harmless to a serious threat. While many arrhythmias are treatable, they must first be accurately detected. Therefore, preventive detection systems are essential. The proposed system is embedded with high predictive capabilities to recognize patterns in an ECG. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) integrated with low-cost IoT sensors, a cloud platform, and a mobile application, it balances accuracy, low latency, and feasibility. The effectiveness of a CNN in recognizing ECG patterns stems from its training on the extensive MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database, achieving 96.0% accuracy, 95.3% sensitivity, and a 95.0% F1-score. This study bridges the gap between wearable health devices and AI-powered predictive analytics by proving the viability of automated, clinically viable, and reasonably priced arrhythmia detection systems."

    "abstract": "The prompt and precise diagnosis of kidney stones is essential in the prevention of serious consequences like infection, chronic kidney damage, urinary blockage, and other life-threatening health issues. For diagnostic purposes on a wide scale, manual processing of CT scans is laborious, prone to mistakes, and inefficient. Using an improved hybrid deep learning architecture, we offer a clinically applicable, completely automated kidney stone diagnosis method in this study. In order to obtain both regional and worldwide picture characteristics, our method combines Ghost Net with Vision Transformers (VIT). Our Attention U-Net effectively separates stone regions from their surrounding anatomical features, allowing for precise segmentation. Using Mobile NetV3, we are able to classify instances as either \"stone\" or \"non-stone,\" a feat that allows for lightweight and quick decision-making, making it ideal for use on edge devices and real-time systems. Over the course of 10 epochs, with 590 batches per epoch, the system was meticulously trained using a balanced and somewhat larger dataset consisting of 6,000 CT images. A recall of 64.85 %, an F1-score of 64.22 %, an accuracy of 63.50 %, and a precision of 63.59 % were all attained by the revised model. Particularly important in clinical settings where early identification is paramount, the model’s improved recall demonstrates its robustness in reducing false negatives. Visualizations and experimental findings show that the model can reliably generate segmentation masks and detect tiny stones. There is great promise for this hybrid framework to become an integral part of clinical workflows, which would increase diagnostic throughput, decrease radiologists’ workload, and keep diagnostic standards high."

[1] In the absence of targeted vaccines and specific antiviral treatments, accurate forecasting is crucial for understanding transmission dynamics and implementing timely interventions. This research focuses on applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the global spread of Mpox by utilizing time-series data and models previously developed for COVID-19 outbreak predictions. [2]To enhance the model's predictive capabilities, we modified the traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) framework and integrated it with RNN architectures. Historical case data from heavily impacted countries, including the United States, Brazil, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, were used to train the model. The results show that the RNN-based model accurately predicts the number of future cases, with a relative error of approximately 12 % when compared to actual data for December 31, 2022. The total predicted cases globally were 94,567, closely aligning with the reported 83,878 cases. For the United States, Brazil, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, the predicted cases were 31,245, 11,689, 7,509, 5,698, 5,487, and 4,328, respectively, with an average relative error of 18 %. Additionally, vaccination scenarios were simulated, revealing that if 30 % of the population were vaccinated with a vaccine having 78% efficacy, the number of cases would reduce by 32 %. This research demonstrates the utility of RNN models in accurately predicting epidemic trends and evaluating intervention strategies. The results provide valuable insights into the potential impact of vaccination and control measures, offering a practical decision-making tool for health authorities in managing the Mpox epidemic."

This paper introduces a novel MultiHop Load Balancing Framework using Deep Q-Learning (MH-LB-DQL) to address the challenges of dynamic topology, energy constraints, and uneven traffic distribution in WSNs. The proposed model formulates the routing process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein each node learns optimal multi-hop forwarding strategies by interacting with the environment and adjusting to changing network conditions. By integrating a Deep Q-Network (DQN), each node autonomously learns to select forwarding paths that minimize energy consumption, prevent bottlenecks, and balance the traffic load across neighboring nodes. The model incorporates parameters such as residual energy, link quality, hop count, and buffer occupancy into the reward function to guide learning effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that MH-LB-DQL significantly outperforms conventional protocols such as LEACH, PEGASIS, and EECR in terms of network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and energy distribution uniformity. Furthermore, the model exhibits high scalability and adaptability in dynamic environments with node mobility and random deployment. The proposed deep reinforcement learning-based load balancing approach offers a robust solution for next-generation scalable WSN applications in smart agriculture, disaster response, and industrial monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Swarm intelligence algorithms have emerged to tackle global optimization, valued for their simplicity, scalability, and population-based search mechanisms. Among them, BKA distinguishes itself with a leader-follower strategy and Cauchyperturbed updates, but most of its variants focus on static modifications, lacking the capacity to adaptively guide agents based on global context. To compensate for this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced swarm intelligence optimizer named Attention-Guided Black-winged Kite Algorithm (AttBKA) which integrates a single-head self-attention mechanism into both the attack and migration phases of the original BKA. This design enables each agent to compute attention-weighted interactions with other individuals by jointly considering positional similarity and fitness quality. Specifically, by designing attention-guided directional offsets in the attack phase, formulating a fitness-aware migration update rule, and incorporating a lightweight learning mechanism to evolve attention parameters dynamically, we enable the swarm to learn more effective behavioral patterns throughout the optimization process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare Att-BKA against three baselines — the original BKA, along with two ablation variants where attention is restricted exclusively to the attack phase and migration phase, respectively — across 18 benchmark functions spanning four problem classes: unimodal, multimodal, separable, and nonseparable landscapes. The results show that Att-BKA consistently achieves faster convergence, better solution accuracy, and improved robustness across the vast majority of categories. Our analyses not only validate the efficacy of attention-guided updates in swarm optimization but, more critically, present a practical and extensible paradigm for integrating attention mechanisms into population-based metaheuristic frameworks."

They typically overlook dynamic spatial correlations across EEG channels and fail to effectively model temporal transitions between sleep stages, resulting in limited classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose STOT-USleepNet, a novel U-shaped fusion network for EEG-based sleep staging. The key innovation integrates Optimal Transport (OT) through a Spatial-Temporal Optimal Transport (STOT) module, which adaptively assigns correlation weights across EEG channels to construct a dynamic, data-driven spatiotemporal map. This module quantifies functional connectivity between brain regions and transition costs between sleep stages. Building on this foundation, we develop an improved dual-branch U-shaped network (USleepNet) to jointly capture time-varying waveform dynamics and the brain’s topological structure. A multi-scale feature interaction mechanism facilitates cross-layer fusion, while a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) at skip connections enhances contextual flow and classification accuracy."

    "abstract": "In the processing of high-frequency repetitive signals for equivalent time sampling oscilloscopes, non-uniform sampling caused by clock jitter severely impairs signal reconstruction accuracy. Traditional interpolation algorithms face dual challenges of amplitude distortion and timing deviation when processing high-frequency non-stationary signals. This paper proposes a cubic spline interpolation algorithm based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The jitter-contaminated signal is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and residual components via EMD. Leveraging the mono-component characteristics of each component, piecewise interpolation and reconstruction are performed to overcome the limitations of conventional methods in fitting non-stationary signals. An experimental dual-layer evaluation system is established: spatial accuracy is quantified by Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for amplitude recovery assessment, while timing accuracy is evaluated using the standard deviation of time interval error and peak-to-peak value of time interval error to measure edge timing deviation. The proposed algorithm demonstrates significant advantages in high-jitter scenarios: at 10 picoseconds and 20 picoseconds jitter levels, MAE is reduce by 78% and 81%, and MSE by 96% and 95%, respectively, compared to traditional cubic spline interpolation. While the standard deviation of time interval error is only 8.5% of the traditional method's value under 10 picoseconds jitter and the peak-to-peak value of time interval error is compressed from 42.2 picoseconds to 6.4 picoseconds, achieving a 6.6-fold improvement in extreme timing deviation control. These results validate the algorithm's dual effectiveness in suppressing amplitude and timing errors in high-jitter environments, providing an efficient solution for high-frequency repetitive signal reconstruction with non-uniform sampling jitter suppression in equivalent time sampling oscilloscopes."

The model forms a multi-stage image optimization system by integrating digital image conversion and preprocessing technologies: firstly, visual images are converted into digital form through sampling, quantization, and encoding technologies; subsequently, efficient extraction and optimization of image features are achieved via operations such as image smoothing, enhancement, and target cropping. In the object detection stage, the FCN is employed for model training, and precise localization and recognition of image objects are realized through the combination of convolutional and deconvolutional layers. Experimental results show that the algorithm performs excellently in dynamic and static image detection tasks, with both accuracy and recall metrics approaching the ideal value of 1. Compared with traditional methods, the detection efficiency is significantly improved, and the detection time is greatly reduced, providing a new technical path for object detection in computer vision."

To compensate for this shortcoming, we introduce SiGrid, which combines Hagrid with the Sector-Based Regularization (SBR) technique. SiGrid applies SBR to generate a scatterplot with a more uniform and generally lower density as an intermediate step. This intermediate scatterplot can then be fed to Hagrid for improved results. We quantitatively evaluate SiGrid by comparing it to Hagrid over a set of 502 scatterplots of different sizes, ranging from 50 to 10000 points per dataset, using relevant quality metrics. While generally slower, the results demonstrate that SiGrid outperforms Hagrid regarding the quality metrics of rank-wise neighborhood preservation (trustworthiness), ordering preservation, and pairwise distance preservation (cross-correlation)."

BPGnet, a novel diffusion-based framework, is proposed to tackle this problem. It utilizes bi-scale prior guidance to improve robustness and classification accuracy in noisy clinical settings. The core of our model is the Hierarchical Conditional Guidance (HCG) module. It operates on two levels: a ResNet-50 enhanced by channel attention extracts global priors, while a lightweight Agent Attention mechanism captures local priors. This dual-scale guidance enables the diffusion process to jointly model structural context and fine-grained lesion details, improving feature discrimination under noise corruption. Extensive evaluations on the HAM10000 (dermatoscopy) and APTOS2019 (retinal fundus) datasets demonstrate that BPGnet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 0.830 and 0.674, and accuracies of 0.910 and 0.858, respectively. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of global and local priors, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven hierarchical design.

    "abstract": "Aquaculture is vital for global food security, yet conventional monitoring and control methods often result in poor water quality, inefficient resource utilization, and limited yield. This paper presents an AI-driven aquaculture monitoring and control system that integrates Edge AI-based anomaly detection, reinforcement learning (DQN) adaptive control, and a hybrid LoRaWAN/5G-IoT communication framework. A multi-parameter sensor network continuously tracks dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia, turbidity, and temperature, with Edge AI enabling real-time anomaly detection and rapid corrective actions. Reinforcement learning dynamically optimizes feeding, aeration, and water exchange, while the hybrid communication model ensures reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient data transfer. Experimental results demonstrate a 75% reduction in system response time, 62.5% improvement in dissolved oxygen stability, 22% higher feed conversion efficiency, 35% reduction in energy consumption, and up to 30% yield improvement over conventional and recent AI-based approaches. Automated feeding lowered feed waste by 70%, and intelligent aeration delivered significant power savings. The proposed framework provides a scalable, cost-effective, and sustainable solution to enhance productivity while reducing operational costs and environmental impact. Future extensions include blockchain-based traceability, drone-assisted monitoring, and offshore aquaculture deployment, advancing the next generation of smart aquaculture technologies."

Leveraging stochastic geometry, our framework enables the systematic assessment of network performance across a range of sharing paradigms, including both conventional single-operator scenarios and advanced hybrid strategies that enable full integration and cooperation among multiple mobile network operators. Our framework incorporates diverse user densities, rate requirements, and energy consumption models to ensure comprehensive analysis. Applying our results to real-world datasets from French mobile network operators, we demonstrate that hybrid network sharing can yield substantial energy savings, up to 35%, while maintaining QoS. Furthermore, our results allow us to characterize how the benefits of network sharing vary as a function of the geographical and functional characteristics of the deployment area. These findings highlight the potential of collaborative sharing strategies to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability in next-generation cellular networks."

This work presents the design and optimization of a 2-bit magnitude comparator using Transmission Gate Logic (TGL), with variants developed by modifying the output stage through dedicated pull-down logic. By designing separate pull-down networks for the output signals, the proposed structures achieve improved voltage swing and reduced power dissipation compared to conventional CMOS designs. The first design employs Gate Diffusion Input (GDI) logic, which reduces transistor count but suffers from partial swing and high-power consumption of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$180.2 \\mu \\mathrm{W}$</tex>. In contrast, the fully TGL-based comparator achieves rail-to-rail output swing and delivers the power dissipation of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$68.5 \\mu \\mathrm{W}$</tex>, representing a 42% reduction compared to the reference and over 60% savings versus the GDI approach. Delay is also reduced from 90.67 ps in the reference to 75.4 ps in the proposed TGL design, marking a 16.8% improvement. These results confirm the effectiveness of dedicated TGL pull-down logic in enabling reliable, energyefficient comparator architectures for VLSI applications."

The wave-forms related to the poorly damped oscillatory mode can be observed when the system is subjected to an external perturbation.

The worldwide shift toward renewable energy creates uncertainties in power supply that lead to grid instability and energy curtailment problems. This paper explores the synergistic convergence of AI compute infrastructure and Bitcoin (BTC) mining as a novel, energy-aware co-optimization framework. We propose a Distributional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system that dynamically allocates surplus energy between latency-sensitive AI jobs and highly flexible BTC mining operations. The proposed solution includes essential participants like renewable energy producers, energy management agents, AI clusters and BTC miners operating within a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The simulation demonstrates that our MARL-driven methodology reduces the reduction in renewable energy by up to 65 % while maintaining high BTC mining profitability and stable grid demand and ensuring AI service level compliance. These findings suggest a path toward sustainable, intelligent energy computation ecosystems where AI and blockchain technologies operate not as competitors, but as complementary agents within a unified infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent chronic disease with significant health and socioeconomic burdens. Early identification of individuals at risk is crucial for effective intervention. This study aims to develop a weighted diabetes risk prediction model using classification data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large-scale U.S. health survey. A total of 253,680 participants aged 18 to 80 were included, and 21 demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and health-related variables were selected. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm was employed to construct predictive models on both original (imbalanced) and enhanced (balanced) datasets. After hyperparameter tuning, the balanced dataset model achieved an ROC_AUC of 0.82 and a Precision-Recall AUC of 0.83, with a recall of 0.80, indicating strong predictive performance. Feature importance analysis revealed Body Mass Index (BMI), high blood pressure, general health status, and age as the most influential predictors. The model demonstrated poor sensitivity on the imbalanced dataset but performed well under class balance conditions. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning models based on categorical survey data for early diabetes risk screening. This approach offers a cost-effective tool to support public health planning, particularly in resource-constrained settings where continuous biomarkers may not be readily available."

In high-security or emotionally sensitive environments, the ability to detect aggression, distress, or instability can serve as a crucial additional safeguard. This paper proposes an emotion-aware access control system that integrates real-time facial emotion recognition (FER) into access decisions, with specific resilience to facial occlusions such as medical or pollution masks. The proposed system employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture trained on augmented datasets to classify core emotional states—including anger, fear, happiness, and neutrality—even when parts of the face are obscured or image quality is degraded. Emotion detection is directly embedded into the access logic, allowing entry for calm or neutral expressions while flagging or denying access for high-risk emotional cues. The system achieves up to 85% classification accuracy in masked scenarios using a YOLOv8-based model, demonstrating strong reliability under occlusion in both lab and real-world conditions. This work introduces a behavioral intelligence layer into biometric access systems, enhancing safety, privacy, and situational awareness."

In this paper, we present a representative semi-urban low-voltage grid for Austria that was defined based on the current status of social household compositions, for which load profiles were created, and actual roll-out of photovoltaics, heat-pumps and battery electric vehicles. The generated behavior-based load profiles are assigned to an electric grid, which is analyzed and compared to reference values displaying differences in monthly and weekday load patterns. We compare and discuss also selected results of the grid simulations, which exhibit significant differences in the load distribution of the simulated 400 kVA transformer."

    "abstract": "Multi-channel RF transceiver front-end is a core component widely used in communication, navigation, radar and other fields. The accuracy of fault diagnosis for it affects the safety and reliability of related systems. The data - driven method is a widely used method to its fault diagnosis in recent years. The performance of the method depends on the training data. Nevertheless, constrained by the non-uniform occurrence of diverse faults, the data volumes of each fault type are usually imbalanced, which causes severe decline in the accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a data generation method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and adaptive conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (Ada-Con-DDPM). First, little sample data is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by VMD. The DDPM is trained to learn the characteristics of the IMFs. Then, this method creates reference IMFs sets and conditional functions with learnable coefficients vector to guide DDPM to generate data. After generation, a loss function is established to evaluate the quality of the generated data and adaptively optimize the scale coefficients vector. Subsequently, data is regenerated using the optimized results. Through iterative repetition, higher quality training data can be generated. We employ various methods for data generation on a same experimental multi-channel transceiver RF front-end. Results show that the data generated by proposed method has better quality, enabling the average accuracy of trained diagnosis model 5.67% higher than the best traditional method under different imbalance ratio."

They successfully capture the typical seasonal cycle of ice growth and melt, with the Arctic reaching a maximum in March-April and a minimum in September and the Antarctic reaching a maximum in September-October and a minimum in February. However, there are significant differences between the datasets in the extent of sea ice, especially during periods of rapid ice formation and melting. The differences between the Arctic datasets are more pronounced, especially during periods of ice freeze-up. The NSIDC-IC-25km product differs most from the others, and the coarser resolution means that more sea areas are identified as sea ice in marginal areas, affecting the identification results. The consistency between the Antarctic datasets is higher (correlation higher than 0.99), and the differences in sea ice extent are smaller, especially during the melting season. Using AMSR2-IC-6.25 km as a benchmark, the data provided by OSISAF are closer to the benchmark and the data provided by NSIDC, and also have a lower RMSD value."

Therefore, this paper focuses on the lightning breakdown characteristic investigations of soybean oil (SO), diisotridecyl adipate (DA), diisooctyl sebacate (DS), PFAE, and isooctyl stearate (IS) based on theoretical computation and experimental validation. First, the microscopic electrical parameters of different structures of ester-based insulating oils were computed by quantum chemistry simulations from an atomic-scale perspective. Then, the difference between microscopic parameters five insulating oils was comparatively analyzed. Furthermore, the impulse insulation strength of five insulating oils was predicted theoretically. Finally, the lightning impulse breakdown voltage (LIBV) with the negative polarity were experimentally tested under the extremely uneven field. Theoretical results show that the difference between the ionization potential (IP), energy gap, excitation energy and electrostatic potential will directly be associated with lightning impulse breakdown characteristics of five insulating oils. The less ester group and unsaturated carbon-carbon double bond, the better the impulse characteristics of insulating oil. The LIBV properties of five insulating oils are obtained, isooctyl stearate (IS) > PFAE > diisooctyl sebacate (DS) > diisotridecyl adipate (DA) >soybean oil (SO). Experiments quantitatively validate that the measured LIBV values agrees with the simulation analysis.

    "abstract": "The dominance of Transformer architectures in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, driven by their self-attention mechanisms and Multilayer perceptron (MLP), faces critical challenges in mathematical interpretability and spectral redundancy sensitivity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Spectral-Spatial Convolutional FourierKAN Transformer (S2CFKAT) framework for HSI classification. Unlike traditional MLP, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) leverages learnable activation functions to achieve superior approximation capacity and nonlinear expression while enhancing adaptability to unbalanced and small-sample scenarios. In the proposed S2CFKAT, a mixed convolutions module (MCM) is designed for preliminary spectral-spatial feature extraction, combining 3D convolution for spectral and spatial continuity preservation and 2D convolution for spatial detail enhancement. Then, a FourierKAN Transformer (FKAT) architecture is presented that synergizes multi-head self-attention mechanisms with learnable spectral-spatial activation functions. This design enables the adaptive fusion of long-range dependencies (via self-attention) and discriminative frequency patterns (via FourierKAN layers). Further, a FourierKAN Block (FKAB) consisting of dual FourierKAN layers is used to learn complex nonlinear interactions of spectral-spatial features. Finally, a FourierKAN classification head is constructed for label learning through the softmax functions in Fourier space. Comparative analysis of four public HSI datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework, S2CFKAT, exhibits superior generalization capabilities over state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, it still maintains high accuracies when classifying small and unbalanced training samples, which shows that our model has good performance and robustness."

    "abstract": "Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) have emerged as essential tools for fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, and start-ups, particularly in developing countries like India. Although previous studies focused on targeting individual factors in the incubators, the systematic analysis of multiple factors is only marginally covered due to a lack of national-level data. We have used a multi-dimensional theoretically driven framework focuses on the evaluation of how different variables such as human capital, mentorship, funding access, technological innovation, and institutional infrastructure determine incubator performance, which is established and empirically evaluated. Using data from 300 incubators across six Indian regions (2013–2023), we applied factor analysis followed by panel count regressions (Fixed-Effects Negative Binomial and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial) that support over dispersion and structural zeros in incubation graduation. Findings demonstrate that scientific capability (e.g., patents), educational intensity, and mentoring are important factors for fostering incubator success. Our proposed model considers science and mentorship, two interconnected pillars upon which startup ecosystems should be developed, which should not only promote theoretical progress but also provide insights relevant to policymakers and practitioners working on the development of entrepreneurial ecosystems in developing countries. This study enhances ecosystem theory by amalgamating mentorship and scientific proficiency, providing evidence-based recommendations for incubator design, regional policy coherence, and globally scalable innovation results."

    "abstract": "Humanoid robots are drawing significant attention as versatile platforms for complex motor control, human-robot interaction, and general-purpose physical intelligence. However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and regularly updated collection of BFM papers and projects to facilitate further research, which is available at <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers</uri>."

    "abstract": "Timely delivery of delay-sensitive information over dynamic, heterogeneous networks is increasingly essential for a range of interactive applications, such as industrial automation, self-driving vehicles, and augmented reality. However, most existing network control solutions target only <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">average</i> delay performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem, and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework allows integrating both data-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services."

By utilizing the linear theory, the dispersion relations of the DEB system are obtained for both continuous and periodic conditions.

Specifically, it can be seen as interactions between a single-electron beam (SEB) system and the other electron beam. Then, the impact of electron beam parameters on the interactions is analyzed, which is helpful for practical design and manufacture. This study provides a perspective to understand the interaction mechanisms that take place in the DEB system, filling the theoretical gap in DEB system studies.

Each sample is annotated with sentiment and emotions, making this the first Hindi resource with multimodal and affective dimensions. Through extensive experiments using IndicBART, IndicBERT, mBERT, and Vision Transformer models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of text–image fusion and affective features across multiple configurations. We also analyze the readability characteristics of genuine and misleading articles, providing insights into the linguistic patterns of Hindi misinformation. This dataset establishes a robust benchmark for multimodal misinformation detection and lays essential groundwork for research in Hindi and other low-resource languages."

    "abstract": "Information and communication technology brings better operation capabilities for the power grids at the cost of vulnerability against cyber-attacks. The false data injection attack (FDIA) on the state estimator (SE) is one of the intelligent cyber threats, for which different detection and mitigation methods are proposed. Nevertheless, data recovery after the FDIAs as one of the mitigative actions has received less attention in the literature. This paper proposes a data recovery scheme based on optimization to maintain the consistency among recovered variables. Also, the attack region is localized in an enhanced way so that the non-attacked variables will be preserved as much as possible. The optimization combines two important sources of information for accurate data recovery, i.e., measurement data inertia (MDI) and prediction data calibration (PDC). MDI and PDC are formed using machine learning methods (respectively regression and XGBoost) based on online training using recent (e.g., two weeks) power grid data. Such training is demonstrated to be fast enough (less than the data acquisition rate) to provide adaptable accurate data recovery considering different conditions. Extensive experiments are implemented on the IEEE 118-bus test system to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Most existing designs focus on non-negative numbers and, when used in real applications, rely on Sign and Magnitude (SM) transformations to deal with signed values mitigating most of the advantages obtained in the first place. This work investigates circuits for the approximate negation of numbers in two’s complement (2’sC) format that offer a middle ground in terms of error and energy efficiency when compared to the exact 2’sC negation and the more aggressive one’s complement (1’sC) negation method, thus obtaining a general purpose tool for approximate computing that can be seamlessly integrated into existing designs. The paper demonstrates that by using this tool it is possible to exploit unsigned approximate arithmetic circuits in signed applications, achieving slightly lower error with no additional power compared to the commonly used 1’sC approximation, or significantly reduced error, while still lowering power dissipation relative to exact 2’sC negation. We derive analytical expressions for error characteristics and present a hardware implementation. The resulting versatile technique can be exploited to compute absolute values or to convert SM representations into 2’sC format.We incorporate the investigated circuits into several approximate architectures using a 14 nm FinFET standard cell library. The resulting designs, when compared with 1’sC negation, are able to improve accuracy (achieving up to 30% error reduction in approximate multipliers and 10dB PSNR gain in H.264 video compression) while still reducing the power dissipation."

    "abstract": "Removing motion blur from videos is a highly challenging task, with existing methods primarily focused on extracting spatio-temporal information from blurred frames and effectively fusing it. Among these, methods based on Transformer have demonstrated particularly outstanding performance in video deblurring tasks. However, the standard self-attention mechanism considers all regions within the feature map, making it difficult to adapt to certain non-uniform blur scenarios. To address this, we propose an adaptive self-attention mechanism that uses the ReLU function and square operation to filter out negative values in attention scores, thereby enhancing the network’s ability to focus on locally severely blurred regions. To accommodate global blurring scenarios, we retain the dense attention branch. To further enable fine-grained feature adjustment, we introduce a bidirectional feature enhancement feed-forward network, which can simultaneously extract spatio-temporal features in both horizontal and vertical directions. We also designed a dynamic feature fusion module to adaptively integrate feature information from neighboring frames to avoid error accumulation during feature fusion. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) laminates are increasingly used in aerospace and other high-performance applications, but their complex conductivity distribution and large-surface areas in practical use pose significant challenges for real time, online structural health monitoring, typically presenting issues such as inadequate signal transmission efficiency, complex electrode array installation, or insufficient data processing efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel scanning measurement strategy and data fusion approach for damage detection of large-surface CFRP with Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). Low-dimensional voltage datasets are generated through moving a local electrode array, and these datasets are fused via a Choquet integral framework weighted by Shapley values, which optimally processes overlapping measurement data and reduces the dimensionality of final measurement dataset. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has an image correlation coefficient and sensitivity uniformity comparable to traditional global measurement methods, while greatly shortening the image reconstruction time and improving the algorithm real-time performance. The proposed method holds promise for extending existing EIT systems to large-surface CFRP, providing high precision, enhanced sensitivity, and real-time performance with the minimum of hardware channels."

Since automation of ports increases in terms of complexity, management of AGV routes and its schedule becomes a key factor to consider in enhancing efficiency. The proposed method employs the utilization of multi-objective optimization algorithms to solve such problems such as finding the shortest distance, reduced energy consumption, and traffic congestion in real-time. The optimization framework takes into account dynamic port environments and AGV constraints such as obstacle avoidance and load balancing and also the tight schedules that need to be met. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves AGV fleet performance by a factor of 20 % while maintaining a balance between travel distance and task completion. Comparison with other methods reveals enhanced optimization results in terms of the speed of computation and the accuracy of the solution in comparison with traditional approaches. This research work offers a solid solution to the growing need for efficient AGV path planning in the contemporary advanced port facilities."

Unlike previous studies that rely on large pre-trained models, this study focuses on building a custom architecture from scratch, emphasizing model efficiency and simplicity. CAE is used to extract 128-dimensional latent features from input images, which are then classified using a shallow CNN architecture. Global Max Pooling is introduced at the bottleneck stage to reduce the number of parameters without sacrificing performance. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing 7,430 labeled samples and achieves 99.33% accuracy with only 0.41 million parameters. Comparing the suggested model to existing model reveals that the proposed model provides an optimal balance between model compactness and predictive performance, making it ideal for future low-resource deployments."

    "abstract": "The usage of the transformer model architecture has rapidly become a popular choice in fields related to natural language processing, computer vision, and many other applications. These models have rapidly grown in size and complexity, now containing billions of parameters. Due to their high popularity, the integrity of these models becomes a critical concern. Faults such as bit flips in memory could be caused not only by radiation-induced soft errors, electrical disturbances, thermal fluctuations and aging hardware, but also by intentional Bit Flip Attacks (BFAs). While classic fault tolerance solutions such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC) can mitigate such faults to some extent, their application is often constrained by cost, power, or design limitations. To develop a low-cost and effective fault tolerance solution, this work studies the fault resilience of two large-scale transformer models - CLIP-ViT and Google-ViT. Through systematic fault injection, we find that different layers exhibit varying fault sensitivities, and that large-magnitude parameter perturbations correlate strongly with performance degradation. Building upon this insight, we propose WSSR, a lightweight fault detection and recovery method that segments model weights into sets and flags changes in set membership for fault recovery. Our experiments show that WSSR can restore model accuracy to 91.7% and 84.3% of the original for CLIPViT and Google-ViT, respectively, on the ImageNet1K dataset with only 0.87% and 7.37% compute overhead and virtually no storage overhead-making it practical for deployment on resource-constrained systems."

Each image is mapped to a 1057-dimensional vector (1056 PI + 1 FD). After standardization (zero-mean, unit-variance scaling) and principal component analysis (75% cumulative variance), a two-layer multilayer perceptron is used for classification. On an augmented set of 800 images (balanced normal/lesion), the proposed method achieves 95.4% accuracy, 95.2% recall, and 96.5% specificity. Rivaling ResNet-50 (95.6%) and VGG-16 (95.3%) while requiring no pixel-level annotation and orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

Conventional solutions often produce delays or demand heavy energy use, while large computing platforms reduce portability. This creates a gap for designs that can combine speed, energy efficiency, and scalability in compact devices. This work introduces a hybrid platform that integrates Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) microphones with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for speech and language processing. MEMS microphones capture signals with clarity, while FPGA units accelerate intensive tasks. Classical algorithms such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are applied for feature extraction, and modern approaches such as lightweight Transformer models and compact large language models (LLMs) are deployed on FPGA resources for classification and sequence modeling. The hybrid integration of deep neural network (DNN) and Transformer-based modules allows accurate representation of acoustic and contextual patterns while maintaining real-time response. The platform is evaluated with recognition word error rate (WER), latency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement, and energy consumption. Results show that combining MEMS sensing with FPGA acceleration and Transformer-based architectures improves both SNR and contextual understanding while reducing power usage. The system demonstrates significant improvement in latency and WER compared with traditional embedded setups, while remaining suitable for portable and low-energy environments. These findings highlight the value of blending MEMS hardware, FPGA accelerators, and state-of-the-art Artificial intelligence (AI) methods to create a practical path for next-generation speech and language technologies."

The proposed approach integrates weather, incident, and construction-aware features to provide a holistic view of traffic behavior.

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide health issue that is increasing in prevalence across different populations. Early detection is necessary to prevent complications such as cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy. Traditional diagnostic approaches tend to rely on invasive blood tests, are clinically validated but do not often predict disease progression beyond a clinical metabolic diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) is a relatively new method which has the ability to identify emergent risk pathways that could be representative of diabetic influences on a patient that are not evident but share common patterns in a heterogeneous dataset of clinical, demographic and lifestyle variables, therefore representing new pathways to help manage and monitor risk. This systematic review consolidates the studies to identify early detection of diabetes using ML techniques, including traditional algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines), emerging methods (ensemble methods, deep learning), and hybrid systems that involve Internet of Things (IoT) devices and federated learning. It prioritises datasets (such as the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, hospital datasets and local databases), metrics of evaluation (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC-AUC). Overall, it has found that ML techniques have better predictive accuracy across studies compared to traditional diagnostic methods. Overall, there are many issues facing ML with concerns over data imbalance, interpretability and generalizability across populations. The systematic review presents an indication of mapping trends in methodologies, a discussion about limitations and suggestions for the future including knowledgeable explainable AI and future EHR integration and a privacy-preserving federated learning environment. In summary, the review highlights the potential of ML to improve early identification and support personalized approaches of diabetes management."

Despite the existence of Computer Vision approaches, the validation of accurate, practical, and non-intrusive methods for detailed baseline stroke classification (forehand vs. backhand) remains limited. This paper proposes a solution to this challenge by systematically implementing and evaluating a framework that integrates pose estimation with long-short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed framework extracts 33 body landmarks from video sequences, which are then processed by a multilevel LSTM architecture. The optimized model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.976 and an F1 score of 0.968 on the test data. These results not only validate the feasibility of the sequential pose-based approach but also establish a strong performance baseline for future digital coaching application development."

    "abstract": "Power grids are undergoing the connection of a large number of new, flexible actors, often involving power electronics equipment. The consequences of integrating these new players have turned out to be only partially anticipated. This reaffirms the need for experimental validation, an intermediary stage between simulation and real-life deployment. Current laboratory infrastructures are often limited to testing a limited number of physical assets, which cannot reproduce the interactions taking place in reality. The opENS project therefore offers an original approach enabling the experimental validation of topics that currently can only be addressed through simulation or small scale experiments. It consists in controlled and communicating inverters, which are programmed to replicate the behavior of any actor: power plant, consumer, storage, etc. They are designed to be easily built in large quantities and subjected to fault testing. They are controlled by a communication and supervision platform that monitors the experiment and collects its data. The emulation of power flows in large networks or interactions between numerous inverters can then be conducted on a laboratory scale. This project is open source for its hardware architecture and open data for both the developments made and the data generated."

Traditional methods often struggle to maintain precision due to the complex, dynamic, and non-linear behaviour of batteries under varying operating conditions. This paper proposes a hardware-based system that utilizes fuzzy logic to address these challenges by effectively managing uncertainties in battery characteristics and enabling real-time reliable SoC estimation. This system continuously monitors individual cell parameters such as voltage and temperature, along with overall current, to accurately assess the battery's condition. An adaptive Constant Current-Constant Voltage (CC-CV) charging strategy is employed, which dynamically adjusts the charging process based on the real-time battery state, ensuring efficient and safe charging. Instead of, data-driven or machine learning techniques, the proposed system solely relies on fuzzy inference, which offers a robust, intelligent solution that enhances battery performance, extends operational life, and overcomes the limitations of conventional estimation and charging methods."

Conventional detection systems are not able to handle the large quantity of unstructured text and multimedia data being created on a daily basis, in addition to guaranteeing privacy and computational performance. The study resolves such difficulties by combining the deep learning Darwens such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and transformer-based frameworks with the big data model that can work with large-scale data like Apache Spark and MapReduce. The suggested method builds upon the principles of distributed in-memory processing and RDD-based anonymization to provide the ability to analyze mass data in a privacy-preserving and high-throughput fashion. Empirical testing indicates that the scalability of the anonymization pipelines and deep learning classifiers together yield high gains in accuracy of detection as well as system performance, especially in the multi-class cyberbullying contexts. Moreover, the framework facilitates cultural flexibility through the integration of sentiment analysis and bias detection modules so that it is robust in various linguistic and social contexts. The findings demonstrate the possibility of implementing end-to-end scalable systems that use AI as a tool to detect cyberbullying in real-time as a technologically sound solution to the challenge of delivering secure, efficient, and socially responsible online communities."

This research project reports the complete development and design project for a failure prediction software, aiming at comprehensively analyzing data on unscheduled power failures in four medium-voltage feeders. First, the data of planned and unplanned interruptions, as well as the weather information, are pre-processed. Then, the correlation of the weekly failure with failure characteristics, different scenarios of maintenance activities, and weather characteristics of the relevant week is investigated. Next, the same steps are conducted to check the existence of mutual information between the stated items and weekly failures, followed by a causality analysis on these features. Subsequently, the best fit hyperparameters are derived for predictive modeling of the weekly failures, using grid search in the form of classification. Then the best model with the best performance is selected, based on the different subsets of the extracted features identified in the feature engineering process. Finally, a user interface software is designed to visually present the results of the analyses and predictions. This study not only provides a feature engineering-empowered MLOps software to gain insights into the factors affecting the failures, but also develops tools contribute to improving preventive maintenance strategies and enhancing the reliability of smart grids."

Although GANs provide very realistic outputs, including pictures, stability problems might impede their training process. Three main iterations of GAN exist: Conditional GAN (cGAN), DCGAN, and Vanilla GAN. The Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is the performance criteria used. By a comparison of produced photos with genuine ones, it assesses realism in the feature space. Because of its label-based method, cGAN shows better control over output during this phase; while, the FID has provided convolution-based DCGAN some edge over Vanilla GAN. By use of FID, these contradictory findings expose the trade-off between the more semantically precise outputs of cGAN and the more stable outputs of DCGAN. This helps every user choose the model best for their situation."

This paper introduces Forecast, a tool for synthesizing deep microprocessor pipelines with support for high-performance cache organizations. Given a functional description of a processor datapath and directives on how to split logic and state accesses into stages, Forecast automatically generates the complete pipeline datapath and fully functional control logic to correctly sequence operations across pipeline stages while maintaining correct operational semantics. Forecast produces logic to enable speculatively scheduled pipelined cache accesses, support buffered stores, and detect and resolve dependencies in the memory system. This tool allows designers to construct deeper pipelined processors with larger capacity and higher throughput caches, improving the performance of these automatically generated processors."

The main issue with LSTM, HMM and traditional SLR are the lack of long-distance understanding and the lack of parallelisation. This research introduces a unique design that overcomes the issues by making use of an attention from the Transformer architecture to better capture the spatial information from the body as well as the gestures due to hand shapes.

However, reactive power sharing is often inaccurate due to mismatches in line and filter impedances, leading to unequal voltage drops and circulating currents. This paper proposes a fully decentralized adaptive virtual impedance (AVI) control strategy to improve reactive power sharing in a single-loop droop-controlled inverter system. The presented AVI method dynamically adjusts each inverter’s output reactance in real time based on local reactive power errors, effectively compensating for impedance differences and aligning the inverters’ overall impedance seen at the bus. Simulation studies of a three-inverter islanded microgrid show that the proposed decentralized AVI method not only improves reactive power sharing but also enhances voltage stability and power quality by mitigating circulating current effects. The AVI method outperforms standard droop control, offering a lightweight, decentralized solution for improved reactive power distribution under both steady-state and transient conditions."

Therefore, this study proposes a complex scheduling algorithm that integrates deep reinforcement learning, nonlinear constrained optimization, and dual decomposition.

First, the model constructs a high-dimensional semantic representation of document resources based on a multimodal knowledge graph. This operation enables semantic retrieval, personalized recommendations, and hotspot analysis. Second, the book scheduling and borrowing tasks are modeled as a Markov decision process. Dynamic policy optimization is implemented through deep reinforcement learning. Then, the model introduces a nonlinear constrained optimization model to characterize the resource and energy constraints of heterogeneous nodes. Furthermore, the model combines the distributed dual decomposition method with the optimization to achieve global coordination and distributed computing.

To assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of the exposure levels of such scenarios a novel sensor network was designed and validated in different measurement scenarios. Measurements using the sensor network during daily operation and during forced download initiated by smartphones reveal the beam dynamics and electrical field strength distribution generated by the adaptive base station. This measurement setup may be used to systematically evaluate the emissions under daily usage and serves as a base station exposure assessment tool for adaptive 5G antenna configurations and future telecommunication networks."

Nevertheless, the inherent weaknesses of sensor nodes, especially with regards to energy supply and processing power are a major impediment to network survival and functionality. This paper provides an intelligent resource allocation system that takes advantage of a hybrid optimization scheme to solve the energy-stressed environment in WSNs. The suggested model is a combination of heuristic algorithms with a machine learning-based prediction methodology to attain effective task scheduling, load balancing, and adaptive power management. Given that global optimization and localized decision-making are incorporated, the framework will result in the minimum energy dissipation and still ensure reliable communication and the accuracy of data. Simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme is superior to the traditional allocation techniques with regards to network lifetime, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption. The paper demonstrates the prospect of hybrid optimization in the development of the future generation of sustainable and intelligent WSN deployments."

These limitations make early diagnosis and effective health monitoring difficult, leading to a higher risk of undetected diseases. This study aims to assist medical practitioners and health authorities in enhancing awareness of active COVID-19 conditions in rural areas, with the objective of encouraging early symptom recognition, preventive action, and timely medical intervention. The study utilizes the \"COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Crosswalk Rural Profile Report based Hardest Hit Area (HHA) Dataset\", which provides an evaluation of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Standard Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been commonly evaluated for healthcare analytics; however they usually take a hit on performance and accuracy in the presence of an imbalanced and varied dataset in the diagnosis of health conditions. To combat this issue, this research presents an Ensemble of Ensemble method (EoE) to improve the predictive performance due to its multi-base learner structure in a stacked set-up. The dataset contains an ample number of attributes including demographics, medical history, and lifestyle factors to allow full analysis of more widespread health conditions. The evaluation includes a systematic comparison of the proposed EoE method against existing ML methods including standard ensemble methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the EoE model has merit as it outperformed existing methods in terms of confusion matrix metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, and precision) indicating EoE could be a beneficial asset for rural healthcare analytics. Findings conclude that the proposed EoE model could be beneficial for early COVID-19 detection and awareness development, ultimately enhancing healthcare accessibility and supporting timely healthcare decision-making for underserved rural populations."

Concurrently, a Vision Transformer (ViT) model classifies potato leaf diseases, including early blight and late blight, from image data. The predictions from both models are incorporated into a linear goal programming formulation that optimizes fertilizer and pesticide allocation under a fixed budget. Experimental results show that the proposed system can dynamically adjust input strategies based on real-time disease detection while maintaining a balance between cost and yield.

    "abstract": "The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles (EV) imposes distinctive constraints upon integrated smart-grid architectures, chief among which is the concurrency of low capital and operational expenditure with stringent reliability for both home and publicly accessible charging infrastructures. Application of standard optimization methodologies, hindered by the problem's high-dimensional topology and severe non-linear interactions, typically produces costed solutions that prove non-viable when subjected to real-world deployment scrutiny. This paper introduces an original hybrid metaheuristic architecture that synthesises the landscape-exploration strengths of the hybrid black-winged kite (HBWK) algorithm and the iterative pruning property afforded by the starfish optimization (SFO) algorithm. The proposed hybrid system, hereafter referred to as HBWK-SFO, executes an extensive municipal-space exploration, following which an iterative pruning and refinement step is undertaken; the dual-phase architecture retains the computational expenditures within practical bounds, while accelerating convergence to a cost-optimal vicinity characterised by real-world relevance. The architecture is directed by a multi-objective cost-metric defined to aggregate, in multiplicative form, the capital outlay, ohmic loses, bulk-grid reactive-insertion penalties, and average detour experienced by users. Exhaustive validation, applying scenario-generating, smart-grid conventions, reveals that the HBWK-SFO consistently outperforms both classical heuristics and current meta-heuristic best practices, effecting a simultaneous lowering of total expenditure and improvement of operational fulfilment. The resulting empirical acceleration of convergence, operational feasibility and empirical reliability within the scheme qualifies the algorithm as a practical tool for architecting the EV charging-network at scale."

The sophistication of these networks is also increasing as operators continue the trend towards digitization, which is beneficial in integrating distributed energy resources. However, as the attack surface increases in size so too does the risk of cyberattacks. The topology, configuration and composition of communication net-works is therefore confidential since this can provide information to attackers. As a result, the number of benchmarks available for research purposes is limited.A tool for procedurally generating communication network topologies is therefore proposed. While primarily intended as an enabler for public research into communication networks, this tool also allows general insights to be gained into the effect of communication network design on the vulnerability of networks to cyberattacks. The tool includes the ability to encapsulate network characteristics in JSON specification files, which is demonstrated with example Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks. The SCADA network generation is then compared to a real-world case. Finally, the effect of network redundancy on the networks’ cyber resilience is investigated."

Digitalisation requires accurate recognition of DERs, which can be achieved by training machine learning (ML) models using a comprehensive labelled dataset that reflects energy penetration from DERs. However, acquiring such a dataset is challenging due to its intrusive nature. Therefore, this research study proposes the use of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) techniques for the non-intrusive identification of residences with photovoltaic (PV) power generation in a local area, using only the aggregated smart meter data of residences and weather data corresponding to the geographical location of the residences. In this paper, a physics-informed algorithm is used to label the smart meter dataset. The study compares the PV identification results obtained by a long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) models using the proposed novel PIML methodology against those from a benchmark LSTM model. The test results show that the proposed physics informed methodology enables the LSTM model to achieve 81% performance accuracy in the context of non-intrusive PV identification."

    "abstract": "Business process agility requires updating BPMN models without disrupting running process instances. However, most BPMN engines, including Camunda, face significant challenges in handling such updates. Their architecture typically separates model deployment from instance execution, which can cause inconsistencies in structure, logic, and data during process changes. Existing migration tools rely on static mapping techniques that are often inadequate for handling the dynamic and complex nature of real-world process evolution. This paper proposes the Unified Workflow Strategy, a faulttolerant approach designed to enable seamless BPMN workflow migration, particularly in scenarios involving update failures. Unlike static methods such as Camunda’s Mapping Resolver, this strategy introduces dynamic instance handling based on two migration methods: Skip and Reprocess. The choice between these methods is guided by a structured Decision Matrix, which assesses the type of workflow change, whether minor or major, and the current data conditions of each instance, classified as stable or evolve. The evaluation involved six distinct workflow update scenarios. In all 6 cases, the Unified Workflow Strategy successfully executed dynamic migration, achieving $100 \\%$ instance continuity. A conceptual implementation design shows how this strategy works in practice. Initial evaluations using sample migration scenarios indicate that the Unified Workflow Strategy can maintain smooth process flow and keep data consistent, even during complex updates. The results not only validate its corrective effectiveness but also highlight its potential to overcome the limitations of existing tools, offering improved system resilience, reduced downtime, and better compliance in dynamic business environments. While further validation is required, this approach provides a strong foundation for advancing reliable BPMN workflow migration techniques in modern workflow engines."

Usually, ABCs are applied at the boundaries of computational domain in order to eliminate spurious reflections at these boundaries which occur in numerical simulations of radiation and scattering problems. As we demonstrate, ABCs originally proposed by Engquist and Majda and later generalized by Trefethen and Halpern can alternatively be derived using the Pauli matrices algebra. For this purpose, the classical wave equation is factorized into two two-dimensional wave equations with first-order time derivatives. Afterwards, suitable approximations (where the wave incidence is assumed to be almost normal to ABC, or the field vector and the wavevector are not exactly orthogonal within ABC) result in one-way wave equations which are applicable as ABCs. In this way, we derive a general set of ABCs, already proposed by Trefethen and Halpern, which includes Engquist and Majda ABCs as special cases."

    "abstract": "It has been well-known that using MBFFs (multi-bit flip-flops) offers a substantial reduction on the dynamic power consumption in digital circuits. However, their big size and limited mobility of their individual flip-flops lead to negative effects on optimizing circuit timing. This work overcomes this fundamental drawback in physical design automation. To this end, we propose two DTCO (design-technology co-optimization) techniques for optimizing timing on MBFF-intensive designs. Precisely, (1) at post-place stage, we make use of the diverse MBFF cell layout structures available with different I/O pin positions in way to remap each MBFF instance to an MBFF structure that is best suited for facilitating optimizing timing on wires, and (2) at post-route stage, we propose to use a new practically feasible scheme of MBFF cell layouts supporting mixed-VTs (threshold-voltages) on individual flip-flops, by which we are able to resolve the timing violations in a fine-grained manner at the cost of much less power overhead than that of the conventional method of VT assignment on MBFF cell instances. In the meantime, through experiments with benchmark circuits, it is shown that in comparison with the final chip implementations produced by the prior MBFF allocation methods i.e., commercial EDA method of MBFF allocation and state-of-the-art MBFF allocation method, Step 1 (i.e., DTCO at post-place) of our DTCO-driven MBFF allocation method is able to reduce the amount of total negative time slack by 11.41% and 10.82% on average, while Step 2 (i.e, our DTCO at post-route) reduces the power consumption of MBFFs by 4.63% over that of the prior methods of conventional VT assignment with no timing degradation."

Interestingly, idea generation alone does not lead to innovation unless mediated by idea realization. This indicates that the successful implementation of innovative ideas is critical for achieving meaningful innovation outcomes. The study contributes both theoretically and practically by identifying the mechanisms through which SMEs can leverage social media platforms and internal knowledge flows to access external ideas, create synergies, and implement innovative strategies. For practitioners, this research highlights the importance of encouraging knowledge-sharing behaviors and investing in tools that facilitate collaborative innovation. For academia, the study offers a refined understanding of innovation processes in SMEs, particularly in emerging economies."

    "abstract": "Stunting remains a persistent public health challenge in Indonesia, affecting nearly one-third of children under five years of age. This condition, characterized by impaired linear growth, results from chronic undernutrition, recurrent infections, and adverse socioeconomic circumstances. Despite various interventions, the prevalence of stunting remains high, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches to support early detection and prevention. Machine learning provides the capability to analyze complex and large-scale datasets, offering more accurate prediction of stunting risk and enabling targeted interventions. This study compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms-Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (MLP)-in predicting stunting. Using a dataset of more than 5,000 records, each model was trained and evaluated through standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, confusion matrix, and ROC curve analysis. The results indicate that all three models achieved strong predictive performance, with GBM demonstrating the highest discriminative ability (AUC = 0.8231), SVM achieving the highest recall (96.23%), and MLP providing a balanced performance with a competitive F1-score (90.74 %). These findings suggest that machine learning models can effectively support early detection of stunting in Indonesia, with GBM emerging as the most robust overall, SVM suitable for high-sensitivity screening, and MLP offering reliable performance across metrics. The integration of such models into public health systems has the potential to accelerate stunting reduction efforts and contribute directly to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)."

    "abstract": "Unlocking the demand response potential of small electricity consumers is crucial to maintain adequate levels of flexibility in future power grids. However, small consumers cannot reach the minimum capacity requirement established by electricity markets and are blocked from participating. This paper proposes a user-centric aggregator that enables demand response providers to specify their minimum acceptable remuneration, promoting fair compensation, and reducing market discrimination. The aggregation process is formulated as an NP-hard optimization problem and solved using a tailored dynamic programming algorithm. The resulting flexibility blocks are submitted to the European platform for manual frequency restoration reserve using three bidding strategies, one of which makes use of the recently introduced complex bidding features. Among all evaluated strategies, we demonstrate that exclusive bidding is the most effective and robust strategy. In addition to surpassing simple and multiple bidding strategies, it also outperforms individual bidding in 77.34% of cases, yielding 110.94% increase in annual user acceptance levels. It is therefore recommended as the most effective approach for aggregators aiming to enhance fairness and market efficiency."

However, while there are still considerations, the need for automated legal text mining has accelerated informed litigative decisions, thereby augmenting the accuracy of rulings, verdicts and enabled refined results in multifarious ways. This paper pivots on accentuating the prominence of pre-processing through the juxtaposed results from two techniques such as the Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) effectuated prior and post pre-processing. Inorder to identify the accuracy of legal text mining, the assiduous steps involved in preprocessing delved in this study entail lowercasing, removal of numbers and punctuation, stopword removal, and stemming. Furthermore, it explores two key feature extraction methods: Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Through visualization and analysis, this study demonstrates the impact of preprocessing on feature extraction, and further accelerate the efficacy of legal text mining.

    "abstract": "In automatic weather stations, platinum resistance temperature sensors play a key role in temperature measurement. To guarantee the accuracy of their measurements, uncertainty analysis and evaluation of calibration results are essential. Traditional GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) methods have limitations, such as requiring uncertainty components to be similar in magnitude and assuming the output quantity follows a normal or t-distribution. To address these issues, this study applies Monte Carlo Methods (MCM) to evaluate the measurement uncertainty of platinum resistance temperature sensors. The process of MCM uncertainty evaluation is introduced, including single-batch MCM and adaptive MCM methods. MATLAB is used to implement MCM. Experiments are conducted on the HYA-T type platinum resistance temperature sensor from Huayun Company at calibration points of -20 ℃, 0 ℃, 20 ℃, and 50 ℃. The uncertainty of the calibration results is evaluated using the MCM method, and comparisons are made with the GUM method. The results show that the MCM method effectively overcomes the limitations of the GUM method and confirms its applicability in this context. This study provides a broader range of methods for uncertainty evaluation in meteorological metrology."

Accurate classification enables timely decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Traditional methods struggle with high-resolution UAV images due to small object sizes, dense distributions, and variable orientations. Convolutional neural networks are proven effective in extracting hierarchical features and handling complex aerial image patterns. Aerial imagery presents challenges such as rotated bounding boxes, dense distributions, and small object detection. This study demonstrates that deep learning significantly enhances UAV image classification compared to traditional approaches. This research performs a comparative evaluation of five CNN models Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, Sparse R-CNN, Dynamic Dense Object Detection (DDOD), and Oriented R-CNN—on the DOTA dataset. Experiments include preprocessing, training with consistent hyperparameters, and performance evaluation. highlights that Oriented R-CNN and Sparse R-CNN are most suitable for UAV applications requiring high accuracy and precise localization. DDOD offers a good balance for dense scenes, while Cascade R-CNN and Faster R-CNN serve as benchmarks. This comparative evaluation confirms importance of selecting CNN architectures aligned with dataset characteristics and task requirements in UAV image classification. The analysis highlights model strengths, limitations, and suitability for UAV image classification, providing insights for future algorithm selection and optimization."

    "abstract": "During wind turbine operation, vibration signals from multi-stage gear meshing in the gearbox exhibit significant overlap, complicating fault diagnosis. Conventional methods require multiple synchronized sensors to monitor vibration and rotational speed at each gear stage, leading to prohibitive hardware costs. This paper proposes a variable-scale fault diagnosis method with the following procedure: First, the output shaft speed is obtained through STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) analysis of the signal, followed by angular resampling to convert the signal into the angular domain. Then, cascaded angular resampling is performed according to each stage's gear transmission ratio to adaptively switch scales, ensuring the target gear shaft's meshing frequency remains at integer orders. Finally, angular-domain averaging is applied to filter out interference signals from other gear stages. The proposed method requires only one single vibration sensor to acquire both order spectra and demodulation spectra for all gear stages, enabling comprehensive multi-stage gear fault diagnosis. User feedback confirms the diagnostic results demonstrate high accuracy."

The electrode radius was optimized to 26.6 mm via 3D electromagnetic simulation, finally achieved global impedance matching across multiple operating modes. Directionality was validated through CST simulations and experimental tests with a current-carrying single wire, showing consistent upstream/downstream signal asymmetry over 10 kHz–100 MHz.

This paper presents a novel method to improve the scalability of black-start MDP formulations by leveraging implicit solutions for line partitions within the network. By identifying network segments with deterministic restoration paths, we compute expected costs without expanding the MDP state space and incorporate them during value iteration. Experimental results on real-world power systems demonstrate a substantial reduction in MDP size while preserving solution optimality, offering an effective and scalable approach to post-disaster power restoration planning."

    "abstract": "The growing number of electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps, and photovoltaic systems increases the risk of congestions in the low-voltage grid. To actively prevent and resolve such critical situations, distribution system operators (DSOs) first need to determine the current grid state. However, many low-voltage grids are still unmonitored. This paper presents a simple, yet effective method for determining the optimal number and placement of meters in a distribution grid to reliably detect grid congestions. We propose to monitor only those feeders where voltage or current can exceed their limits. Those can be identified using a load flow calculation (LFC) and applying a critical load distribution based on coincidence factors. Then, meters are placed following simple rules. For the state estimation (SE) itself, the weighted least squares method is used, which is already implemented in common software. This approach is tested on rural and urban grids. For numerous load scenarios, the SE is compared to the LFC. The results show that with only a few strategically placed meters all critical grid situations are detected. Thus, this approach allows DSOs to achieve congestion detection with minimal effort and cost."

Sampling at 8 kHz and processing 3000 Hz signals via Fast Fourier Transform, it achieved an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8.2^{\\circ} \\pm 2.5^{\\circ}$</tex> angular error, outperforming the original <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5}^{\\circ} \\pm \\mathbf{4}^{\\circ}$</tex>, with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 0 \\%}$</tex> resolution for 15°-spaced sources.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach by integrating a fuzzy PID control algorithm with a gray prediction model, enhancing the main fuzzy PID controller with an auxiliary gray prediction unit for dynamic parameter adjustment. This method aims to achieve finer temperature control. The simulation outcomes reveal a notable improvement: the integrated gray predictive-fuzzy PID system exhibits an 18.58 % reduction in overshoot relative to conventional PID systems, and a modest 1.25 % improvement over standalone fuzzy PID controls. Furthermore, it shows a significant decrease in adjustment time- 104.396 seconds faster than traditional PID setups and 103.305 seconds quicker than fuzzy PID configurations alone. These findings affirm the effectiveness of the hybrid gray prediction and fuzzy PID methodology in enhancing the temperature regulation of thermostatic water baths."

However, people often encounter \"friction\" when using embedding visualization tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading, scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2) limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses modern web technologies and advanced algorithms—including density-based clustering, and automated labeling—to provide a fast and rich data analysis experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas’s feature set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis."

Traditional traffic management systems, relying on static rules or isolated machine learning models, struggle to adapt to real-time dynamic conditions. This research proposes a hybrid approach that integrates conventional machine learning, deep learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize traffic flow, reduce waiting times, and enhance safety. We benchmark multiple models—Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, and CNN—on traffic flow prediction, with CNN demonstrating the highest accuracy improvement over other baselines. To address real-time control, we design a multi-agent Deep Q-Network (DQN) for adaptive signal management in a synthetic traffic grid, incorporating safety events and pedestrian interactions. Novel evaluation methods such as ROC analysis for safety prediction, congestion class confusion matrices, and explainability through neighbor contribution analysis are employed. Experimental results indicate significant reductions in vehicle and pedestrian wait times, improved safety event handling, and superior predictive accuracy, highlighting the novelty of combining learning-based prediction with reinforcement learning–based control for intelligent traffic management."

To address this, we propose a framework for realistic image restoration. Our contributions are twofold. First, we design an advanced degradation pipeline that generates diverse and realistic training data through randomized operation ordering, refined parameter ranges, and explicit camera noise simulation. Second, we introduce a lightweight Student model distilled from the original Real-ESRGAN via a Teacher-Student strategy, substantially reducing computational cost while preserving restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces outputs more consistent with human visual perception and generalizes effectively to real-world degradations. This framework offers a practical solution for applications such as photo enhancement, medical imaging, and surveillance analysis.

Although user-based flexibility can mitigate these issues, coordination with Distribution System Operators (DSOs) is often limited by lack of the information exchange.

Using a multi-objective optimization approach, the CMA coordinates flexible assets to minimize user costs and support the grid during congestion, based on day-ahead prices and forecast data. The strategy was tested in a real-world low-voltage grid in the Netherlands, solving the congestion up to the available potential. Results highlight the importance of minimizing forecast and hardware response errors to enhance control performance."

The current-federated learning methods of detecting seizures lack sufficient characteristics to enable privacy-guarded healthcare applications that need frequency-zone analysis with harmonic frequencies. FedSeize fills these gaps with a new algorithmic approach of extracting facial features in the frequency landscape using harmonic frequencies. The system makes use of deep max-out networks to detect seizures and operate data captured by IoT edge devices that are transmitted to the central hub. FedSeize completes some edge-compute processing steps, and further reduces federated learning communication costs by sending frequency-domain representations of EEGs rather than raw signals, resulting in a 30% lower communicating volume than raw signals at retaining crucial spectral features needed to identify seizures.Using CHB-MIT dataset, the extensive analysis proves that FedSeize outperforms centralized models with 8% in heterogeneous data scenario with 92 % detection accuracy. This approach combining local harmonic processing and federated learning gives a guarantee of adherence to privacy rules, and, at the same time, high familiar criteria in medical practice, establishing the balance between preserving privacy in AI and the possibility of its clinical use in distributed networks of smart healthcare."

To generate realistic training data for the two ANN-based approaches, fault simulations are performed using DIgSILENT software in the IEEE 9-bus system, considering various fault locations, fault resistances, and measurement noise levels. The performance of the trained ANN model is validated using synthesized data that the ANN model has never experienced considering different fault locations and fault resistances."

    "abstract": "Conventional performance evaluation of IoT device lifetime typically considers only the battery state-of-charge and does not take into account the complex dynamics of the battery itself. Here, we present a IoT device lifetime model that more accurately reflects how batteries respond to IoT-typical loads.Our key insight is that an IoT device's power-saving sleep/wake cycle imposes intermittent pulse loads on the battery; the load duration and current depend on the operations(s) performed by the device during each awake interval. Our model therefore predicts the minimum output voltage that will be observed at the battery in response to a given pulse load. This value determines whether the battery is able to meet the input voltage requirements of the IoT device.We have developed an support vector regression (SVR)-based battery model using a dataset consisting of measurements of the voltage response of small lithium titanate (LTO) batteries to over 90K pulse loads. The model predicts the battery's minimum output voltage in response to a given pulse load with an RMAE (Root Mean Absolute Error) of less than 3% over the full operational range of the battery. The accuracy decreases at the more critical lower end of the voltage range, however, falling to ~ 8-10%RMAE.This pulse-response model allows us to create a \"synthetic battery\" and track its voltage response to a sequence of pulse loads, supporting a more realistic lifetime model where the IoT device fails as soon as the battery's predicted output voltage fails to meet its input voltage requirements."

Guided by this theory, the UDI-MI algorithm is developed to dynamically identify discriminative features and filter redundant ones through adaptive thresholds. By integrating decision information measures with exponential decay of mutual information, the algorithm balances classification performance and feature independence.

To better comprehend patient emotions, interactions, and concerns, this study investigates the use of thick data analytics in the healthcare industry by utilizing social media data, such as Twitter chats. The suggested system builds conversation graphs to simulate conversations and uses community recognition techniques, such as Walk trap, Louvain, and Edge Betweenness, to find connected conversation clusters Additionally, machine learning methods like Node2Vec assist in node classification and association prediction, while anomaly detection approaches assist in identifying odd sentiment patterns. Feature Isomorphism Discovery and other transfer learning strategies improve adaptability by updating models in response to the emergence of new data streams. Timeline analysis and effective visualisation are made possible by tools such as Neo4j.

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources in power grids poses significant challenges for grid operators. For a safe operation, inverter-based generators must comply with network code on requirements for generators (low voltage ride-through as well as start-up and reconnection). However, these requirements evolved at a different pace from the actual operating performance of distributed generation and storage technologies, such as solar photovoltaic inverters and electric vehicles (EVs). Thus, compliance with these requirements is not guaranteed. In this paper, the start-up and reconnection requirements of EVs are evaluated over a range of voltage and frequency disturbance scenarios. Tests have been carried out at SYSLAB, part of Technical University of Denmark (DTU) over a range of operating conditions using EVs from different manufacturers. Tested operating conditions include reconnection to the grid at different voltage and frequency set-points ranging from 360 to 440 V and 48.5 to 51.5 Hz. The results indicate that the tested components do not fully comply with the ride-through and cease-of-operation requirements, which may pose serious risks to safe power grid operation, especially as the uptake of these technologies increase."

    "abstract": "One of the primary means of treatment and support for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) that leads to significantly improved developmental outcomes is the early detection of this condition. A multi-layered neural network model that uses the Adam optimizer is proposed in this paper to provide accurate, quick, and energy-efficient characterization of the ASD in persons using behavioral and clinical features. The system proposed initiates a phase of preprocessing that extensively involves data normalization and the management of missing entries so that the input for training is of good quality. The process of selecting features is performed using a correlation-based filtering method to achieve a higher model performance by reducing dimensionality. The main point of this work is represented by deploying a reformed Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) scheme that is in line with the adaptive learning rates given by the Adam optimizer, thus providing a great boost in speed in getting to the solution and not going into local minima. Training and testing of the developed samples, which can be sourced online, allows results to be compared and analysis to assess the detection performance of Decision Trees, SVMs, and basic MLPs without adaptive optimization to be greatly improved. Higher precision, recall, and AUC scores achieved by the introduced approach confirm it as one of the reliable tools for the early detection of autism. In addition, this approach enables not only an improvement in classification accuracy but also the robustness and generalizability of results among different populations, thus being a significant assistant in healthcare diagnostics."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of converter-based generation, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery energy storage, to enhance power system frequency response. The analysis introduces a method for quantifying the improvement in frequency nadir when converter-based resources participate in frequency control. The method is based only on real frequency measurements. Two system models are considered: a base power system without converter-based support, and the same system with integrated converter-based generation. By deriving expressions based solely on frequency and power measurements, without requiring detailed system parameters or generator transfer functions, the proposed approach offers practical applicability for real-world systems. Overall, the proposed methodology enables system operators to assess the contribution of converter-based resources in supporting frequency stability and helps in determining reserve levels for RES in low-inertia power systems."

To mitigate the degradation of model predictive control (MPC) under parameter mismatches, a robust MPC scheme based on cost-function design is proposed. First, the effects of distinct parameter mismatches on the system’s electrical and mechanical responses are analyzed. Subsequently, a parameter-sensitivity function is introduced to identify, during voltage selection, the voltage vector with minimal sensitivity to parameter perturbations, thereby enhancing robustness. Furthermore, a virtual-voltage-vector technique is incorporated to reduce reliance on weighting-coefficient tuning and to alleviate the computational burden. Evidence from simulations verifies the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach, with the adverse impact of parameter mismatches markedly suppressed."

    "abstract": "This The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicles has revolutionized modern transportation, integrating intelligent systems that rely heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT). These vehicles are equipped with numerous IoT-enabled sensors and communication modules to ensure real-time decision-making, route planning, obstacle avoidance, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The cybersecurity-related balance of data communication methods utilized in autonomous vehicles may increase more exposure in the data communication procedure among these vehicles and IoT devices. Securing autonomous vehicle systems (AVS) is dominant to ensure the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous transport. Cybersecurity recognition includes the execution of innovative threat detection devices to recognize and moderate potential cyber-attacks. Applying a combination of anomaly recognition, machine learning (ML) and encryption methods, these systems can able to monitor network traffic, detect strange patterns, and quickly respond to any malicious actions. The exclusive tasks modeled by autonomous vehicles like the requirement for real-world decision-making and the huge extent of data produced, need robust and adaptive cybersecurity methods. To resolve these issues, this manuscript proposes a novel Cybersecurity Detection using a Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Self-Driving Vehicle Networks, named CDHDL-SDVN technique in IoT. The CDHDL-SDVN technique aims to recognize cyberattacks in self-driving vehicle networks using a hyperparameter-tuned ensemble deep learning (DL) model. At the initial stage, the CDHDL-SDVN technique utilizes a linear scalar normalization approach for data pre-processing. Besides, an artificial gorilla troops optimizer (GTO)-based feature selection process is performed to reduce the high dimensionality problem. Moreover, the cyberattack detection is performed by employing an ensemble of long short-term memory (LSTM), deep extreme learning machines (DELM), and gated recurrent units (GRUs) models. At last, the hyperparameter tuning of DL models is accomplished by using an artificial ecosystem-based optimization (AEO) approach. A series of tests were accomplished to test the performance of the CDHDL-SDVN technique. The experimentation validation of the CDHDL-SDVN technique attains a superior accuracy value of 98.61% over existing techniques in enhancing cybersecurity in self-driving vehicle networks."

The considered metasurface converts part of the incident wave on it into the orthogonally polarized scattered field. The combination of the patch antenna and the metasurface resulted in circular polarization with a realized gain of 5.1 dBi. The distance between the antenna and the metasurface was optimized to provide the required phase shift for the effective realization of circular polarization."

However, existing edge bundling methods often have high computational complexity, leading to scalability issues. This paper presents a new framework for fast edge bundling and faithfulness metrics for large and complex graphs using spectral sparsification, which sparsifies a graph G into a subgraph G′ with O(nlogn) edges, preserving the spectrum of G. We first present a general framework FEB (Fast Edge Bundling) utilizing spectral sparsification to improve the efficiency of existing bundling methods while maintaining a similar quality of bundling. We then present FBQ (Fast Bundling Quality) framework for proxy bundle faithfulness metrics, to measure how FEB faithfully preserves the ground truth structure in the original edge bundling, with two variants, FBQ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">JS</inf> (utilizing Jaccard Similarity) and FBQ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SQ</inf> (utilizing sampling quality metrics).

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of the Internet of Vehicular has enabled a wide range of vehicular applications, intensifying the demand for low-latency and high-efficiency computation. However, the limited onboard computing capabilities and the highly dynamic nature of vehicular networks present significant challenges for task offloading and resource allocation. To tackle these challenges, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) incorporates Roadside Units (RSU) not only as computing nodes but also as relay nodes capable of multi-hop task forwarding, effectively extending the offloading scope and mitigating transmission constraints in sparse or high-mobility scenarios. Moreover, due to the diversity of task demands and fluctuating resource availability, it becomes essential to dynamically adjust task priorities to ensure timely task completion and efficient resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel Computing Offloading and Resource Allocation strategy under Relay Collaboration (CORA-RC). CORARC exploits the dual roles of RSU as computing and relay nodes to extend the offloading range and improve flexibility, while jointly optimizing task offloading, dynamic priority adjustment, and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that CORA-RC ensures the timely completion of security-related tasks while effectively reducing the average task delay, thereby achieving the lowest average weighted cost among all compared strategies."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in battery materials have significantly improved their charge-to-weight ratio providing fast progress in battery-dependent technologies and expanding the market for cordless devices in particular. Cordless vacuum cleaners have become especially popular due to enhanced convenience compared to wired models. This growing demand has boosted research activity toward further size and weight reduction. As a result, motors and impellers have been considerably scaled down to just a few centimeters in diameter, while the operating frequency of ac voltage applied to energize the motors is now increased to exceed 2 kHz. However, the reduced size and mass of the motor metal components have negatively affected cooling efficiency, making heat dissipation a major challenge in the development of compact, high-speed motors. To overcome this thermal issue, this paper proposes a novel motor design having a six-pointed star-shaped stator with toroidal windings placed at its vertices. This configuration increases the stator surface area ensuring the improvement of the heat dissipation. Moreover, the enlarged spacing between windings improves cooling conditions allowing the motor to conduct higher current through the stator windings without overheating. A working prototype of the proposed motor was developed and tested to evaluate its performance and thermal characteristics. An experiment-based comparative analysis with commercial vacuum cleaner motors showed that the prototype outperformed them in both operational and thermal parameters confirming the effectiveness of the proposed concept."

    "abstract": "The illicit alcohol trading is a serious global problem, because about 25%–C40% of all spirits distributed worldwide are adulterated, causing dozens of deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations among the adolescents and young adults. The battle against the counterfeit alcohol consumption can be won by the incorporation of a miniature metal-phenolic film-coated quartz crystal microbalance (MPF-QCM) into a wireless portable electronic device for point-of-use analysis of fermented beverages, but the impact of psychrometric conditions on the detection of denatured alcohol is still unclear. We address this lack of knowledge by analyzing the resonance response of two nominally identical 5 MHz MPF-QCMs toward alterations in the temperature and humidity, while in such conditions examining their detection efficiency to the saturated vapor of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or mixtures of these alcohols. The implementation of more than 180 experimental cycles reveals that the as-prepared MPF-QCMs are not substantially affected by the ambient atmosphere, and even in highly humid environments, a resolution of 3.6 mg/L methanol is reachable, which is close to the dose inflicting blindness (3.2 mg). The sensors are also capable of differentiating submilliliter and milliliter volumes of two toxic denaturants in ethanol (resolution of ~0.13/100 mL) based on changes in the volatility of the background solution, generating proportional resonance frequency upshifts with respect to the baseline and shortened reaction times. This outcome confirms the strong potential of our technology for repeatable and reliable real-world assessment of the quality of various alcoholic drinks, helping to prevent the intoxication with counterfeit alcohol."

    "abstract": "Surface discharge is generated along the interface of insulators under a high electric field and is a critical issue for high-voltage equipment. Surface discharge propagation can be effectively suppressed by barriers on the surface of the insulator. Such barriers are widely used in high-voltage equipment, such as outdoor insulators and bushings. In recent years, advancements in three-dimensional (3D) printing technology have enabled the fabrication of insulation resins with more complex structures. This technology allows for the creation of more effective barrier structures to suppress surface discharge. In this study, the relationship between corrugated barrier structures and surface discharge characteristics is investigated. Samples with varying barrier widths and depths were prepared using 3D printing, and the partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) and flashover voltage (FOV) on the insulator surface are measured for each sample. For the PDIV, samples with larger barrier widths and larger barrier depths show higher values, while for the FOV, samples with smaller barrier widths show higher values. This paper presents the comparison and analysis of the differences in electric fields and discharge propagation paths caused by the barrier structure."

To address this challenge, this article proposes a dc-link peak voltage-based loop control. Frequency-domain analysis demonstrates that the proposed method effectively decouples the dominant poles from the RHP zero, enabling the design of a higher crossover frequency to improve dynamic response.

High-precision motion compensation for THz SAR remains an urgent problem to be solved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a THz SAR motion compensation algorithm based on adaptive sub-aperture segmentation and SFLS. First, the long aperture data is adaptively segmented into sub-apertures. After coarse compensation, the SFLS algorithm is used to estimate harmonic vibrations, effectively correcting the azimuth error incoherent accumulation and severe defocusing caused by high-frequency harmonic vibrations. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness and reliability are validated through simulation data and airborne measured data"

However, the problem of radiometric differences exists in NDVI products derived from multi-scale and multi-source remote sensing images. To address this issue, a reference based framework for regional high-resolution seasonal seamless vegetation index products was constructed. The main steps include edge outlier removal, geometric alignment, RPC correction, pan-sharpening, resampling, data chunking, NDVI normalization, and result mosaicking. Partially, a region-to-region moment matching method was introduced into the referenced relative radiometric normalization framework. The framework proposed in this study effectively reduces the inter-scene radiometric differences in suburban and urban scenes. Significantly, it also demonstrates better normalization effects for images from different sensors with different features. Compared with MODIS and GaoFen-1 NDVI products, the products generated in this study show significant advantages. In conclusion, this study provides applicable situations and parameter setting suggestions for different normalization methods, as well as a local high-resolution NDVI product, which is important for refined regional vegetation research."

Phase-coded communication signals are embedded into frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW to enable communication while maintaining sensing capability. To improve target perception, we develop a track-before-detect algorithm using a multidimensional Hough Transform (MHT).

    "abstract": "The Arabian Peninsula is one of the regions in the world with the highest potential for solar energy development in the sense that the levels of solar irradiance are very high, making it an ideal site to install photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, this huge potential is seriously undermined by enduring environmental problems, especially the high levels of airborne particulate matter and anthropogenic pollutants that together reduce the intensity of the sun and contribute to the rapid soiling of PV modules. Though the current literature has largely concentrated on the quantification of the technical performance instability of PV systems caused by soiling phenomena, the associated extensive analysis in terms of quantifying the technical losses into quantifiable economic and operational effects on a regional level is strikingly lacking in the literature. This study builds a combined machine learning system in order to quantitatively measure the economic losses attributable to air pollution for utility-scale, grid-connected PV systems across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states. We developed and strictly tested a Random Forest regression model with a remarkable coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 98.24 that was trained on a large dataset of meteorological parameters, real-time air pollution data (PM2.52.5, PM1010, SO22, NO22, O33, CO) and the most important operational features of solar panels that occurred between 2018 and 2020. With the help of this validated predictive model, we conducted an advanced counterfactual analysis by modeling the potential power production under hypothetical conditions of clean atmosphere benchmarks. We show that air pollution is one of the contributors to the loss of 8.5% to 12.3% of annual energy production in the region; or more simply, it is a significant loss that can translate to huge financial fines, which can significantly affect the economics of projects. In addition, we propose a new data-driven predictive cleaning scheduling algorithm that proves capable of cutting operational expenditures (OPEX) by up to 25 percent relative to traditional calendar-driven cleaning schedules. The findings are empirically based, critical to renewable energy investors, utility grid operators, and policymakers, and they categorically highlight the significant economic necessity to set up wide-ranging air pollution reduction measures, even as operation and maintenance (O&M) protocols in arid, dust-prone geographical settings run to their optimum."

    "abstract": "Accurate and real-time disparity estimation from stereo images is crucial for many intelligent applications, such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and augmented reality. Although many advanced stereo matching networks have been proposed in recent years, they typically focus more on the quality of the reconstructed disparity maps and overlook the reconstruction efficiency. In this paper, to balance the accuracy and real-time performance, we propose a lightweight nonlocal spatial stereo disparity reconstruction network (NLSDR-Net), which effectively incorporates an adaptive nonlocal spatial disparity map refinement (ANLS-DMR) subnetwork and CGI-Stereo architecture to achieve robust and real-time disparity map prediction. The main contribution of the proposed NLSDR-Net is the ANLS-DMR subnetwork, which consists of a context-guided cost volume super-resolution module to generate a robust geometric spatial similarity feature, and an adaptive nonlocal spatial disparity propagation module that refines the initial disparity map by adaptive learning of the disparity residuals from the image feature, disparity prior, and geometric spatial similarity feature, to produce more accurate disparity prediction results. Five publicly available datasets, i.e., Sceneflow, KITTI stereo, Middlebury 3.0, ETH3D, and Vaihingen stereo, were adopted to assess the performance of NLSDR-Net. The comprehensive experimental results illustrate that NLSDR-Net can achieve more robust disparity map estimation results than the existing state-of-the-art real-time stereo matching architectures. Specifically, compared to the current real-time stereo matching CCAStereo architecture, NLSDR-Net can produce more accurate disparity prediction results in terms of the “D1-all” score (1.77% vs. 1.95%), while maintaining a competitive computational efficiency (14.7 fps vs. 17.5 fps) on the KITTI 2015 test set.

The proposed TSR-based scheduler is designed to minimize makespan, reduce energy consumption, and maximize throughput, addressing the challenges of dynamic workloads and resource heterogeneity. Extensive simulations conducted in the iFogSim environment using the real-world Tesla workload demonstrate that TSR achieves superior performance compared to traditional metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Specifically, TSR reduces makespan by 21.6%, lowers energy consumption by 24.3%, and enhances throughput by 19.7%, thereby ensuring more efficient utilization of fog and cloud resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of TSR in meeting the QoS requirements of IoT applications while promoting sustainable computing in fog– cloud ecosystems."

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of social network users, community detection (CD) is a pivotal task in the analysis of complex networks, focusing on identifying tightly-knit groups of nodes. Community structures in complex networks usually have complex characteristics such as overlap, dynamics, locality, etc., which poses new challenges to traditional CD methods. Some traditional CD methods often struggle with accurately detecting communities and achieving high-quality divisions due to the intricate and diverse nature of these networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an Assisted-task based Evolutionary Multi-Task optimization method for CD (A-EMTCD) in complex networks. In A-EMTCD, the inclusion of assisted task provides supplementary information that effectively guides the objective of community detection. To facilitate seamless knowledge transfer between the primary and assisted task, we designed an efficient knowledge crossover mechanism (KCM) to enable the exchange of valuable information between different target tasks. Additionally, an innovative knowledge-based population initialization (KPI) strategy is proposed that leverages second-order neighborhood information of the target network. The KPI strategy informs the node selection during the individual encoding process, resulting in a higher quality initial population. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our proposed A-EMTCD method compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

This research compares two of the most commonly used supervised learning models, SupportVectorRegression (SVR) and RandomForestClassifier (RFC), to predict short-term bullish price movements in selected Indian stocks. Using historical daily data from 2022 to 2025 for multiple NSE-listed stocks, technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA10, EMA50), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD components were computed as predictive features. A 5% profit target in 60 days generated actionable buy signals. After conducting experiments, the Random Forest consistently outperformed the SVR, achieving the highest individual stock accuracy of 89.3% (SDBL.NS) and a higher overall average accuracy of 81.54%, compared to the SVR's accuracy of 78.50%. These findings highlight the ensemble model's superior capability in handling noisy market data and non-linear patterns. This comparative analysis offers practical insights for traders and researchers designing robust algorithmic trading strategies in emerging markets."

    "abstract": "Traffic collisions consistently provide substantial challenges to urban safety, resulting in considerable human and economic costs. Conventional accident prediction techniques frequently fail to identify complex patterns in real-time urban traffic settings. The proposed study handles the issue by presenting a hybrid model that combines Random Forest for feature importance evaluation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential accident forecasting. The suggested method captures essential variables including traffic volume, weather conditions, and geolocation data, which are subsequently preprocessed and sorted utilising Random Forest. The highest-ranked characteristics are subsequently converted into temporal sequences to train the LSTM, enabling the model to identify trends before accident occurrences. Experimental analysis on synthesised real-world datasets reveals substantial improvements in performance compared to conventional models. The hybrid RF–LSTM model attains 96.2% accuracy, 94.8% precision, 95.6% recall, 95.2% F1-score, and 0.981 AUC-ROC, outperforming the performance of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Vanilla LSTM baselines. The suggested study presents a scalable, high-precision framework appropriate for real-time implementation in smart city systems. The model's resilience and predictive capability can greatly aid metropolitan authorities in proactive traffic management, thus minimising the probability and severity of road accidents. These results confirm the practical feasibility and superiority of the proposed method in improving road safety."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for formulating and training artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn a representation of primary frequency reserves in power systems from stochastic operational data. There is growing concern regarding the frequency quality of power systems. This has led some transmission system operators to implement prequalification requirements for primary frequency reserve units that describe a series of tests aimed at mapping the characteristics of the potential reserve providing unit. However, in their current form, these tests are costly and few, if any, published alternative approaches currently exist. To address this, we present a method of determining the relevant characteristics—e.g., droop—from ordinary operational data. We train an ANN to approximate the unit behavior by matching the predicted and data-estimated moments of active power, using the unscented transform. We demonstrate the method on a standard test system and investigate its robustness. This method not only provides a potentially cheaper and less invasive identification method for primary frequency reserves, but also a more expressive, stochastic description of reserve providing units, compared to the deterministic methods currently in use."

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy-preserving computations on encrypted data with strong security guarantees. Torus-based FHE (TFHE) emerges as a promising candidate among FHE variants due to its efficient Boolean logic operation and unlimited computational depth. However, it heavily relies on bootstrapping, a computationally intensive technique. Although there has been significant progress in improving the throughput and latency of the bootstrapping process, there exists a gap in the energy efficiency research of this process without compromising its speed. Also, energy-efficient implementation of TFHE is a key requirement for its application in energy-constrained systems. This work introduces THENA, an energy-efficient bootstrapping accelerator for TFHE built on a heterogeneous Versal adaptive system on chip (ASoC) platform to address this gap. THENA partitions the bootstrapping workload into different parts of ASoC: the serial operations are handled by the processing system (PS), the compute-intensive torus multiplications are mapped to the adaptive intelligent engine (AIE), and the memory and communication operations are allocated on the programming logic (PL). THENA derives a wavefront arraybased energy-efficient multiplier, achieving a higher <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(2 \\times)$</tex> improvement in throughput over a similar implementation (SaberNTT, TCAS '23). THENA uses this multiplier to deliver an end-to-end bootstrapping accelerator on the Versal VCK-190 platform.

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a common malignancy with a poor prognosis, and intestinal metaplasia (IM) is an important precursor to its development. Currently, there is a lack of systematic modeling and prediction methods for the molecular mechanisms of action of mRNA vaccines in the transformation of IM to gastric cancer, which limits the development of precise prevention strategies. This article constructs a molecular mechanism modeling framework based on advanced computational intelligence and graph neural network (GNN) technology. First, mRNA expression profiles, protein interaction networks, and immune-related signaling pathways are integrated in a multi-omics database to encode feature vectors of key genes. Second, a deep graph convolutional layer is used to mine topological dependencies between genes, and an attention mechanism empowered by machine learning is used to achieve weighted learning of immune regulatory signals. A time series prediction module utilizing temporal deep learning algorithms is then used to model the dynamic trajectory of intestinal metaplasia to gastric cancer transformation. Finally, the model is optimized through cross-validation driven by high-performance computing. Results showed that the model achieved an AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.91 in target prediction tasks, with an average accuracy of 87.6%. It also identified 12 transcription factors (such as STAT3 and NF-κB) and three key signaling pathways (PI3K-AKT, Wnt, and MAPK) significantly associated with mRNA vaccine responses."

To address this problem, this paper proposes a fuzzy rough set-based unsupervised dynamic feature selection algorithm (UDFS), which quantifies data ambiguity by constructing a fuzzy information system, and combines with a particle swarm optimization algorithm to achieve adaptive screening of microgrid operation features. On this basis, the scenario-based control strategy is designed: the fuzzy control algorithm is utilized to dynamically adjust the control logic for typical scenarios. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional control strategy, this paper's method can reduce the maximum frequency fluctuation from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{\\pm 0. 7 H z}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{\\pm 0. 3 H z}$</tex> in islanding mode, and the abandonment rate from 22 % to 5 %, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Electroencephalogram (EEG) methods are used to record these. It takes a lot of time and is prone to inaccuracy to manually detect and localize seizure activity. The seizure EEG dataset from Temple University Hospital (TUH) is used in this investigation. We developed a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) model for seizure detection, which achieved 97.5% accuracy. Furthermore, the TUH dataset's channel-wise information is utilized to help locate epileptic areas. Metrics like the confusion matrix and precision were used to evaluate the models.

The work primarily uses Modelica ® as an object - oriented, cyber - physical, multi domain, equation - based language as a foundation, although there are many other simulation platforms available. A wide range of radio - frequency threats are considered, including electromagnetic compatibility, electromagnetic pulse, lightning, electromagnetic interference, intentional electromagnetic interference and quasi - static fields using several field parameters and modulations. We will first develop basis functions (classes) for system simulation and use biological systems as instances for those classes. Biological time scales are more than three orders of magnitude slower than those for typical electronics systems. For example, it will be shown that pulse - repetition frequency should also be used for electromagnetic - compatibility standards in addition to the usual field/frequency skyline."

However, the inherent interleaved switching states of the POI cause high-frequency circulating currents (HFCC), which undermines current balance among POI and degrades the output quality. To address this issue, this paper proposes an optimized carrier-based modulation strategy for three-level POI, aiming to mitigate both HFCC and common-mode voltage (CMV). Firstly within the integrated five-level plane, low-CMV vector sequences are selected in each sector to suppress the slope of HFCC. Secondly, by injecting specific zero-sequence components into the reference signals and applying the carrier phase-shift strategy according to different sectors, the selected sequences can be synthesized with low computational burden. Finally, compared with several existing modulations, a series of simulations and experimental validations on a 300-kW POI fed FESM demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

Bitwise-operation-based PIM can exploit subarray bandwidth, but traditional designs struggle with summation because long carry propagation limits parallelism. We propose PIM-SUM, an in-DRAM summation primitive for Sparse Length Sum (SLS) in recommendation workloads. PIM-SUM reformulates vector summation as column-wise accumulation via popcount, truncating carry propagation and avoiding redundant in-DRAM computation. This enables highthroughput summation using native DRAM bitwise primitives. PIM-SUM integrates a Reed-Solomon-inspired error correction at the DRAM row level. Its linearity supports parity propagation, enabling integrity checking and multi-bit error correction with low overhead. On DLRM workloads, PIM-SUM achieves up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.14 \\times$</tex> speedup, logarithmic I/O reduction, and large energy savings.

    "abstract": "The high penetration of wind power plants (WPPs) has increased uncertainty in the operations of power systems. The lack of voltage and frequency support from WPP raises significant concerns about system stability and can result in more severe cascading failure propagation following a system disturbance. A promising approach to solving this problem is the grid-forming inverters, specifically based on the virtual synchronous machine inverter (VSMI) principle, which however are still largely unexplored. Moreover, integrating the modeling of VSMI-based WPP into a dynamic cascading simulator has been largely ignored by existing studies. Hence, this article presents a dynamic cascading failure analysis under different penetration levels of VSMI-based WPP to accurately reflect the failure propagation. Furthermore, the impact of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in case of insufficient system support from VSMI-based WPP is investigated. Contingency analyses for N-1 and N-2 scenarios, with and without BESS, are carried out on a modified IEEE 39-bus system to demonstrate the propagation of failures at various penetration levels of WPPs. Integrating BESS with VSMI-based WPPs offers an effective solution to suppress system oscillations and significantly reduce load shedding by 8% in N-1 and 9% in N-2 contingency scenarios compared to scenarios without BESS."

    "abstract": "Beam position monitoring (BPM) is a crucial diagnostic technique used in synchrotron operation. In the context of measurement data fitting, the moving least-squares and moving total least-squares (MTLS) techniques are commonly employed. A common vulnerability to outliers exists in both methods, arising from their respective strategies used to compute local approximation coefficients. This susceptibility can result in significantly distorted estimates. To circumvent the subjective assignment of small weights or predefined thresholds while mitigating the impact of outliers and random errors across all variables, this paper introduces a robust MTLS (RMTLS) method. The proposed method utilizes an improved least trimmed squares (ILTS) technique to derive local approximations within the influence domain. Experiments demonstrate that, under periodic sinusoidal noise, RMTLS achieves positional mean values comparable to conventional TLS, but with a higher standard deviation, indicating its superior preservation of central tendency. Under uniform quantization noise, RMTLS exhibits a significantly lower standard deviation than TLS, yielding smoother fitting curvesproof of its enhanced ability to suppress discrete noise. RMTLS offers a more robust solution for high-precision beam diagnostics."

It exhibits high security and data integrity characteristics; however, there is a chance that a model Poisson attack can occur in both the local and global models, leading to misclassification and falsified decisions. It is observed that the malicious models are injected randomly. The proposed work employs the Adversarial Autoencoder in the global model, which uses the discriminator network to identify anomaly patterns and updates the FedMA approach to reject those gradients. In this way, the proposed work achieved a detection rate of 92.23% with a high detection rate of 96.4%.

The analysis process is carried out through the stages of text preprocessing, manual labeling, model training, and evaluation using confusion matrix. The test results show that the SVM model provides higher and stable performance in various data proportion scenarios (highest accuracy 81.03%) compared to Naïve Bayes (highest accuracy 70.26%). This finding confirms that SVM is more reliable in handling data imbalance and negative sentiment classification.

None of the existing open-source simulators provide both realistic wireless communications while enabling the training, in a cluttered environment, of multi-UAVs movement strategies using RL. Thus, in this paper, we present a simulator where we focus on improving the modeling of the network access part, i.e., the communications between the UAVs and the users, by integrating signal propagation, physical rate adaptation and medium access sharing models. We evaluate the performance of a standard independent RL algorithm trained in our simulator across various use case scenarios, and compare the results obtained using different learning objectives.

This framework is specifically designed for optimizing and controlling intelligent robot path planning performance. This strategy addresses the shortcomings of traditional algorithms in terms of convergence speed and optimality in complex dynamic environments. The proposed framework consists of three core modules: Module 1: a monocular bird's-eye view (BEV) environment modeling and feature extraction module; Module 2: a dual-strategy reinforcement learning control module combining PPO and LLM-DQN; and Module 3: the AlphaEvolve global optimization module. This framework enhances environmental representation through a semantic cross-attention mechanism. Then, the AlphaEvolve's segmented encoding and prioritization strategies enable global evolutionary optimization of the policy network parameters and path node selection. This enhances the global robustness and planning quality of the path. In the experimental phase, this study constructed two typical scenarios, sparse static obstacle scenarios and dense static obstacle scenarios, and compared them with baseline algorithms, including A *, MsAACO, BAPFACO, Dueling DQN+DDQN-APF, PPO, and AlphaEvolve. The results showed that in the sparse obstacle scenario, the proposed method reduced path length by 0.095 m (approximately 0.93%, t-test p=5.828e-07) compared to AlphaEvolve, significantly reduced energy consumption (p=3.763e-06), and achieved a planning time lower than that of the pure evolutionary strategy while maintaining a near-l000/0 success rate. In the dense obstacle scenario, the proposed method reduced path length by 0.594 m (approximately 2.58%, p=1.219e-38) compared to AlphaEvolve, significantly reducing energy consumption (p=3.235e-38), while it also improves the success rate to 98.20%."

To address these challenges of image dehazing, we introduce a novel approach, DEA-Net-CR-LapSE, which enhances the state-of-the-art Detail-Enhanced Attention Network (DEA-Net) through several contributions. First, we integrate an additional loss, named Laplacian Pyramid Loss (LPL), into the total loss function to enhance the efficacy of Difference Convolutions (DCs) in capturing high-frequency information. Second, we adjust the channel attention within the DEA-Net to mitigate the influence of spatial attention outputs on the channel attention outputs. Third, we propose an alternative fusion strategy that combines four DCs and one Vanilla Convolution (VC) to improve the stability of feature maps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DEA-Net-CR-LapSE, surpassing the original model, through PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large amounts of data with diverse and imbalance distribution, therein leading to capability bottlenecks. In vertical domains, incremental domain-specific pre-training has become a common method to capability enhancement. However, without subsequent safety alignment, injecting domain data can perturb the base model’s distribution and increase jailbreak success rates, which may increase the risk of security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Prior work largely emphasizes domain performance gaining from fine-tuning or incremental pre-training, with limited attention to safety risks induced by distributional shifts. In this study, we address this gap by proposing an adaptive twolayer inspection framework that enforces safety checks at both the input and output token levels. On the input side, semantic embeddings and clustering-based intent tagging drive dynamic rule injection against adversarial prompts. On the output side, a speculative decoding guard performs per-token safety classification with thresholding and resampling-based fallback. Experiments on open-source LLMs demonstrate that our framework reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) under multiple temperatures and remains effective after domain-specific post-training, mitigating Boundary Risk Exposure (BRE) fragmentation while preserving task utility."

    "abstract": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become increasingly important in the global hospitality sector, with Singapore emerging as a unique context for understanding its implementation. This research examines CSR activity within Singapore’s hospitality industry,employing a content analysis involving a review of websites and sustainability reports on the websites from 159 member hotels of Singapore Hotel Association. The study explores the different dimensions of CSR,focusing on stakeholder influences,initiative scopes,and implementation challenges. The research reveals that only 9% of properties provide comprehensive sustainability reports,indicating a limited CSR maturity. Key CSR activities include energy conservation,water management,and environmental protection,predominantly driven by governmental regulations and international sustainability standards. Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demonstrates a strategic approach to CSR,with significant emphasis on economic growth,responsible consumption,and climate action. The findings highlight Singapore’s distinctive top-down governmental approach to CSR,characterized by financial incentives,regulatory support,and a tripartite stakeholder engagement model. The research contributes critical insights into CSR practices in an Asian context,identifying challenges such as inconsistent reporting,measurement difficulties,and limited comprehensive engagement. By revealing these nuances,the study provides a foundational understanding of CSR evolution in Singapore’s hospitality sector and offers recommendations for more effective reporting of sustainable business practices."

Deep neural network (DNN) advancements have demonstrated potential in automating LDH categorization by learning intricate features from MRI and CT scans, among other medical imaging modalities. The current level of DNN-based categorization of LDH is criticized in this paper, which also briefly discusses the models' features and architecture, performance measures used for evaluation, and limitations. In particular, the study discusses recent advancements in transformer-based frameworks, hybrid models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in this field to enhance the manual intervention and diagnosis quality. The research also clarifies the obstacles related to class imbalance, generalizability, and restricted annotated datasets, opening the door for future context for the development of strong, clinically useful deep learning LDH classifiers."

    "abstract": "In night vision environments, visible-light images often suffer from limited detail information, while infrared images may exhibit issues such as low contrast, resulting in blurred and indistinct target edges. This leads to a mismatch between infrared and visible-light information, and the use of a single data source fails to provide comprehensive feature coverage, making it difficult to adapt to complex and dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware learning-driven multimodal night vision image fusion framework. Our approach begins by constructing and training a semantic segmentation network. Subsequently, a nested densely connected fusion network is built and guided by the pre-trained semantic segmentation network during its training process. This enables the fusion network to apply region-specific fusion strategies, achieving fine-grained control over the fusion process. By emphasizing the texture details and pixel intensity of target regions, the fusion results align more closely with the semantic information of different areas in the image. Compared to mainstream encoder-decoder-based fusion methods, our proposed method achieves an average improvement of no less than 3% in evaluation metrics such as Entropy (EN) and Standard Deviation (SD) on the MSRS dataset."

    "abstract": "Satellite clock bias prediction represents a pivotal technology for enhancing the accuracy of time-frequency synchronization and autonomous operation capabilities in satellites. While conventional prediction models are limited in their ability to process strongly nonlinear time series data, deep learning-based models demonstrate superior capability in capturing complex temporal patterns. However, their performance remains critically contingent upon optimal hyperparameter configurations. Addressing the computational inefficiency and suboptimal resource allocation inherent in existing hyperparameter optimization methods, this study proposes a dynamic resource allocation strategy based on the Hyperband algorithm to optimize Transformer-based satellite clock bias prediction models. The proposed methodology intelligently explores and exploits the hyperparameter space through a dual-loop mechanism (comprising outer resource allocation and inner early-stopping screening), integrating geometrically progressive resource budget allocation with successive halving strategies. Experimental results demonstrate three key findings: (1) The Hyperband algorithm achieves an 86.5% reduction in required training epochs compared to conventional grid search under equivalent computational resource constraints; (2) Validation loss decreases to 0.206 using optimized configurations; (3) Model dimensionality emerges as the dominant hyperparameter influencing prediction accuracy. This optimization framework significantly enhances hyperparameter search efficiency, providing a novel technical solution for hyperparameter tuning in high-dimensional deep learning models."

Traditional manual inspection methods suffer from inherent limitations including low efficiency, restricted accuracy, and high susceptibility to human error, failing to meet demanding requirements of modern high-volume production environments. This paper presents an innovative PCB defect detection system based on the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework, employing RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformer) as its core detection algorithm with sophisticated hybrid encoder design that decouples intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion operations, and an IoU-aware query selection strategy that aligns classification confidence with localization accuracy.

The virtual power plant model coordinates to the collective response the demand response events while ensuring operational feasibility. A case study involving a virtual power plant with ten members, using real-world solar generation and load profiles, demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. Results show that a coordinated centralized use of member battery storage significantly improves the ability of virtual power plant to meet demand response event requirements while maintaining individual member constraints and increasing revenue for its users."

    "abstract": "DNA is a high-density long-lasting storage medium that has the potential to keep up with the ever-increasing data storage needs. However, DNA storage is incredibly error-prone. The more nucleotides stored in the DNA strand the greater the chance of data loss. Moreover, DNA storage faces a specific phenomenon called error propagation due to its encoding from binary to nucleotide, resulting in an even higher error rate. When the majority of relevant data is stored inside the DNA strand error propagation is limited to the single strand. Reducing the overall data stored in DNA allows for more error correction and error protection. In this paper, we propose an isolation and deduplication scheme called Pixel-DNA for images. PixelDNA uses specific properties of DNA and DNA strands to implement multiple levels of deduplication while maximizing the data isolation. Also, a data segmentation scheme is applied to further increase the density of DNA storage. Based on the experimental results, Pixel-DNA allows for increased robustness and recoverability of images while increasing the density of DNA storage capacity."

While Large Language Models (LLMs) present a potential solution, they are often hindered by issues of ‘hallucination’ and outdated knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces LAURA (A Legal Agent Using Reasoning and Acting), a novel agent-based question-answering system tailored for Vietnamese law. LAURA operates on an agentic workflow, leveraging an LLM as its core reasoning engine. The system is built on the ReAct paradigm, which synergizes reasoning with the use of retrieval tools to process legal queries effectively. To enhance accuracy and minimize errors, a custom retrieval module was developed, combining Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with the BM25 sparse retriever and the multilingual-e5 dense retriever. Furthermore, LAURA integrates Tavily Search to access the latest legal information from external sources in real-time. This integrated approach demonstrates the significant potential of combining agentic reasoning with multi-source retrieval to create an accurate and interpretable legal question-answering system for the Vietnamese language."

The current form of training and coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen, 5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this approach to other precision-based sports."

Based on the GUM guidelines, a measurement model was constructed to quantify each source of uncertainty. Through experiments, ultrasonic flight time data at a wind speed of 10 m/s were measured, and the calculated vertical elevation angle was 0.379°. The uncertainty primarily originates from the repeatability of ultrasonic flight time measurements and equipment resolution. The combined standard uncertainty is 0.00325 radians (0.19°), and the expanded uncertainty (k = 2) is 0.19°. The study indicates that improving the stability of transducers and timing accuracy can optimize instrument performance. This evaluation method provides a pathway for instrument optimization and a basis for data reliability assessment in applications such as meteorology and wind energy, particularly requiring consideration of angle errors in wind field analysis under complex scenarios. Future research will expand to wide operating conditions to improve the applicability and accuracy of the evaluation model."

This article presents a method and application designed to connect to phasor measurement units (PMUs) and continuously monitor data to provide early warnings for low-frequency oscillations in electric power systems. The implemented Python application — OscilloWatch — uses the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to analyze PMU data in time segments, creating a Hilbert spectrum that represents frequency over time. The application combines rows in the spectrum to detect oscillating modes, estimating each mode’s damping by fitting a decaying exponential curve to its amplitude. If a mode shows low damping, the application raises an alarm to alert operators to potentially unstable oscillations. The application has been tested on real and simulated PMU data, demonstrating promising accuracy and robustness against noise. As a proof of concept, OscilloWatch lacks a user interface, but the source code has been released under an open license, with the goal of future development into a fully operational tool for grid operators."

    "abstract": "Quantum dot supercrystals (extended periodic arrays of few-level quantum dots) are known to exhibit optical bistability at sufficiently high densities - continuous-wave incident light has multiple distinct scattering patterns, which can be switched between using short control pulses. Past works have explored nonlinear effects such as this in the dense limit (quantum-dot separations much smaller than incident wavelength), while others have investigated collective linear effects at lower dot densities. Here we bridge these studies by mapping out the occurrence of bistability as a function of quantumdot separation and other parameters such as laser detuning, for a variety of level structures. We find that separation is by far the most important parameter in determining whether bistability (or multistability) will manifest, although detuning is also relevant, with bistability possible at larger separations for smaller detunings. We further observe that while bistability is rather insensitive to the level structure, other quantities such as reflection and transmission coefficients show a dramatic difference between different structures."

In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with neural architecture search (NAS) to address these challenges. Specifically, this paper offers three important contributions. (1) We design a contrastive learning framework that incorporates hardware performance counters (HPC) to analyze the runtime behavior of target ransomware. (2) We introduce a customized loss function that encourages early-stage detection of malicious activity, and significantly reduces the detection latency. (3) We deploy a neural architecture search (NAS) framework to automatically construct adaptive model architectures, allowing the detector to flexibly align with unseen ransomware variants."

    "abstract": "Learning evaluation is a systematic process for assessing student learning outcomes, now supported by digital technology for efficiency. MCQs still dominate despite their inability to measure conceptual understanding in depth. In contrast, open-ended questions, such as SAQs, are more comprehensive in assessing understanding but are less popular due to their greater time and resource requirements. Previous research on Automatic Short-Answer Grading (ASAG) has generally been limited to closed domains and specific datasets such as ASAP or SciEntBank. It has not addressed more complex open domains. However, developing an ASAG system in an open domain context faces challenges in accuracy, generalization, and efficiency, particularly in terms of data selection, semantic representation, and the limited availability of labeled data. Therefore, this study develops an ASAG architecture based on the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach, which combines unsupervised fine-tuning strategies and human intervention to ensure efficient and accurate assessment in an open-domain context. The proposed architecture comprises five layers: the input layer, preprocessing layer, sampling engine layer (SEL), HITL layer, and AI grading layer. The most important layer in the proposed architecture is SEL, where the experiment results show that the initial scoring of $20 \\%$ of students’ answers by the teacher as a form of human-in-the-loop is able to produce good score predictions, with SMAPE values ranging from $\\mathbf{1 0 \\%}$ to $\\mathbf{2 0 \\%}$. Adjusting the input representation to match the characteristics of students’ answers and setting the hyperparameters of the neural network architecture are necessary to enhance the performance of the score prediction model and prevent overfitting. The final results show that the SMAPE values for the employed datasets (Dataset A, B, and C) are 13.23%, $14.23 \\%$, and $19.71 \\%$, respectively. These results indicate that the application of the HITL mechanism in ASAG can overcome real-world implementation problems related to the need for a system that is adaptive to the assessment topic while maintaining the efficiency of the assessment process carried out by teachers."

    "abstract": "Because of the explosive growth of e-commerce, user-generated product reviews have become a vital source of data for understanding consumer sentiment. However, because these reviews are often noisy, highly unbalanced, and unstructured, automated sentiment classification is challenging. In this study, we present a hybrid deep learning framework that blends transformer-based contextual embeddings with recurrent sequence modeling. Specifically, our architecture employs a bidirectional GRU stack to capture sequential dependencies, an LSTM layer to preserve long-term contextual information, and RoBERTa for contextualized feature extraction. To further increase robustness, we employ a preprocessing pipeline that consists of class-imbalance handling via focal loss, subword tokenization, and text normalization. The model is trained using AdamW optimization, mixed precision, and regularization techniques like dropout to improve generalization. We test our method on extensive datasets of Amazon product reviews and show consistent gains over baselines such as standalone LSTMs, fine-tuned RoBERTa, and TF-IDF with logistic regression. According to experimental results, our approach has strong generalization to complex review patterns like negation and achieves higher macro F1-scores and AUC, especially on minority sentiment classes."

The computation consists of three steps: solving the inhomogeneous electromagnetic (EM) scattering problem to obtain the electric field distribution, computing the specific absorption rate (SAR), and solving Pennes' bioheat equation. The inhomogeneous EM scattering problem is addressed using a hybrid boundary element/finite element method (BEM/FEM) with edge elements-a computationally expensive approach. However, this study demonstrates that significant reduction in computational cost can be achieved by carefully crafting the computational model. Once the electric field distribution is known, it serves as a volumetric heat source in Pennes' bioheat equation, which is then solved using FEM. As expected from EM theory, the results indicate that at bluetooth frequencies, EM heating is predominantly localized at the surface of the phantom."

Through use of the simplified modal weighting coefficient formulation for dipole moment excitation, the interaction between the noise source and the characteristic modes can be quantified according to the modal analysis results. Decomposing the induced short-circuit current on the antenna port into the contributions of different modes enables identification of the critical mode in the interference.

    "abstract": "In recent years, a myriad of Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator architectures have been proposed targeting efficient Sparse Matrix-Sparse Matrix Multiplication (SpMSpM) for the edge. Most focus on the dataflow, i.e., the order in which processing elements perform multiply-accumulate operations, while overlooking the influence of memory structures. For Gustavson-based dataflows, which have been proven to be the most efficient for the mid-sparsity scenarios exhibited by sparse DNN workloads, we find that the memory structure's organization storing partial results significantly affects performance. Different DNN models, even layers within the same model, impose diverse requirements on this structure. Rigid designs, commonly assumed so far, often cause frequent merging operations that degrade performance. In this work, we advocate for the necessity of providing adaptability at this memory structure and propose QuFi, a configurable merging memory structure designed for easy integration into any Gustavson-based accelerator and tailored to edge devices. Implemented as a collection of queues across multiple memory banks, QuFi supports reconfigurability through queue fusion and dynamic clustering while providing high bandwidth. Through a detailed evaluation that considers its inclusion into a state-of-the-art accelerator design for the edge, we show that QuFi provides an average speedup of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.64 \\times$</tex>, up to 73 % reduction in off-chip memory traffic, and leads to total accelerator area savings of 17 %."

This paper presents a comprehensive simulation-based analysis of a two-stage EV charger comprising an Active Front-End (AFE) and a Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge (PSFB) DC-DC converter. A detailed MATLAB/Simulink model, including dq-axis current control, SVPWM, and root locus–tuned PI regulation, is developed to capture converter-grid interactions. Simulations were conducted under varying short-circuit ratios (SCR), X/R ratios, and islanding scenarios. Results show that under nominal grid conditions (SCR = 6), the charger maintains IEEE 519-2014 compliance, with current THD below 5% and stable voltage regulation. However, with SCR reduced to 2, current THD exceeds 10%, and voltage deviations surpass acceptable limits. Highly resistive grids (X/R = 0.1) further amplify harmonic distortion. In the islanding case, the system exhibits negative impedance behavior, leading to controller instability and voltage collapse within milliseconds after disconnection. These findings highlight the critical role of integrated converter control design and underscore the need for grid-forming capabilities and advanced damping strategies to ensure robust EV charger operation in weak grid environments."

First, a multi-faceted evaluation system is proposed to assess the hosting capacity for distributed renewables in the distribution network. This study further developed a hybrid weighting scheme for hosting capacity assessment, employing an improved Analytic Hierarchy Process for subjective weights and the CRITIC method for objective weights. Subsequently, a model was constructed to enhance the distributed photovoltaic hosting capacity through energy storage capacity optimization. The GA-CPSO algorithm was applied to solve this formulated model.

Firstly, the TX features a two-layer coil staggered arrangement, providing a relatively uniform magnetic field and low leakage flux, which effectively enhances its anti-misalignment performance. The receiving coil (RX) is designed with a minimum outer radius to ensure the rated power pickup. Then, the optimal transmission efficiency condition is derived, which is related to the TX's current, mutual inductance, and the activated TXs number. Based on the optimal efficiency condition, TX's activation strategy is determined by further detecting the voltage and current on the primary side and the load to identify mutual inductance. An experimental prototype is carried out to validate the proposal. The results show that the proposed system can transmit a constant power of 500W in the presence of misalignments, with a maximum efficiency of 91%."

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) address these challenges, yet optimal deployment (centralized vs. distributed) under dynamic pricing remains unclear. Here we show that centralized storage combined with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization reduces annual costs by 62% compared to photovoltaic-only systems, achieves a 9-year payback period that critically exceeds its projected 8-year lifespan, while also providing an additional 7% of monthly Self-Consumption Ratio (SCR) compared to distributed systems. MILP optimization leverages aggregated load profiles for maximum arbitrage revenue but accelerates battery degradation through frequent cycling. Our findings highlight a critical trade-off between economic optimization and battery lifespan, underscoring the need for balanced, multi-objective frameworks to support high renewable penetration in low-carbon grids."

To cope with transmission constraints and the unavailability of full state measurements, we design a novel sampled-data observer that concurrently estimates system states and reconstructs FDI attacks, thereby enabling effective attack compensation within the control loop. Moreover, we introduce a resilient event-triggered mechanism (ETM) capable of tolerating energy-bounded DoS attacks. By integrating this mechanism with the proposed observer, we construct an observer-based event-triggered controller that ensures system stability without requiring detailed attack information. The controller guarantees asymptotically bounded convergence under mixed attacks while avoiding restrictive assumptions in the existence analysis. Numerical simulations conducted on a three-tank system and an inverted pendulum system validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed approach compared to existing methods."

Experimental results show that an external low-power load of approx. 3.6 W, such as a standard server fan, is sufficient to generate approximately 16 μW and 64 μW (i.e., for two different GaN transistors) of radiated power at the transistor’s drain connection with the PL. This emitted energy, harvested using a 100 mH inductor, is capable of powering a remote SOH monitoring system consisting of a Microchip PIC24F 16-bit microcontroller, three MCP9700 temperature sensors, and an MRF89XA 868 MHz transceiver. The resulting system is able to collect sensor data and, after a brief energy accumulation period (the system’s warm-start charging cycle), wirelessly transmit it to a base station. To further illustrate the practicality of the proposed SOH monitoring solution, the two GaN transistors were intentionally driven into a thermal runaway regime while operating in low-power mode on a 12 W load. Under these conditions, the harvested energy/emmited radiation increased to approximately 620 μW and 3,216 μW, representing about 38 and 50 times the values observed in the previous low-power demonstration, respectively."

    "abstract": "Small-object detection plays a critical role in real-time aerial, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and satellite vision systems, as well as many other domains, where hardware constraints and deployment environments demand high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Although numerous lightweight object detectors have been proposed, there exists a lack of rigorous, cross-platform benchmarks that evaluate these models under consistent conditions for small-object-focused applications. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of eight recent lightweight You Look Only Once (YOLO)-based models, including YOLOX-Nano and YOLOv6–v12 variants. Models are trained using a unified pipeline and evaluated on three representative datasets: VisDrone2019, DOTA-v1.5, and xView. Performance is assessed on both cloud GPUs (NVIDIA A100) and an edge AI platform (Jetson Orin Nano), using PyTorch and TensorRT (FP16) runtimes. The evaluation metrics include mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, F1-score, latency, FPS, memory footprint, and energy consumption (via VDD_IN telemetry). Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-Nano and YOLOv9-Tiny achieve leading accuracy across datasets, while YOLOv6-Nano and YOLOv10-Nano offer favorable trade-offs in speed and memory. TensorRT optimization yields 3×–5× speedup over PyTorch. Energy draw ranges from 7.6 W to 10.4 W, depending on the model and configuration. Pareto frontiers reveal that no single model dominates across all objectives. The study highlights the importance of multi-objective benchmarking in edge AI and provides practical guidance for selecting detectors based on deployment-specific constraints. The findings support theory-driven and application-oriented advancement of efficient detection architectures for real-time, resource-aware computer vision systems."

However, most methods are node or graph-centered, often overlooking valuable information that can be encoded in edge features and relations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and a novel taxonomy of Edge-Aware Graph Learning Methods, i.e., models that explicitly leverage edge information in the learning process. We trace the evolution of these methods from classical approaches through random walks to modern GNN architectures, including the emerging paradigm of Edge-Aware Graph Transformers. Through a comparative analysis, we demonstrate the consistent performance gains of these models over traditional node-centric approaches across a wide range of real-world applications and benchmarks. However, many challenges arise in this field. As such, we provide an explicit discussion of key limitations, particularly the scalability issues and computational overhead associated with many current architectures. Finally, by synthesizing the state-of-the-art and identifying open problems, this survey provides a clear roadmap to guide future research toward developing more efficient, scalable, and robust edge-aware models."

    "abstract": "Modern microservice architectures face significant auto-scaling challenges due to dynamic workloads, heterogeneous resource demands, and competing quality objectives like performance, cost, and reliability. Existing solutions often adopt either centralized (bottleneck-prone) or decentralized (conflictprone) architectures, rely on single-metric threshold-based adaptations, and lack formal guarantees on system behavior. To address these limitations, we propose HARMONY, a holistic auto-scaling framework that ensures both hierarchical coordination, multi-objective adaptation, and formal verification for microservices. The layered MAPE-K architecture of HARMONY enables coordinated adaptation between individual microservices and the overall system through shared knowledge and distributed quality adaptation mechanisms. The Pareto-based planning strategy of HARMONY dynamically selects compromise scaling actions that balance system-wide objectives with microservice-level constraints. HARMONY formalizes adaptation behaviors using Hierarchical Parallel Petri Nets (HPPNs), enabling rigorous verification of deadlock freeness, boundedness, and correctness. We implement HARMONY through the ScopeNet framework and evaluate it through a realistic e-business case study. Results show that HARMONY: (1) autonomously coordinates cross-service adaptations, (2) optimizes trade-offs among conflicting objectives, and (3) ensures reliable behavior under diverse runtime conditions. These capabilities represent a significant improvement in the state of the art for scalable, verifiable, and adaptive microservice auto-scaling."

Compared with other machine learning-based methods, it has an advantage in terms of the number of data points and hyperparameters. However, it may fail when the actual object of motion differs from that of acquired human motion. Conventional studies consider human stiffness, which characterizes the intention of human motion. Although they performed better than the original MRS with variable objects, they estimated human impedance using linear interpolation. Linear interpolation is insufficient for generating novel, human-like motions that are nonlinear and time-variant. In this article, more sophisticated motions were generated by fitting the relationship between environmental stiffness and position, velocity, and force nonlinearly using Gaussian process regression, which requires a smaller amount of data compared to machine learning-based schemes. Through experiments, the data number and error reduction between the true human motion and actual motion were confirmed by comparing the original and conventional MRS and the imitation learning. Therefore, the proposed method can generate motion for variable objects more precisely with a small amount of human motion data."

Traditional road surveys are costly and periodic, while smartphone-based sensor methods, using accelerometers and GPS data inside motor vehicles, suffer from signal damping due to suspension systems. This paper introduces a Bicycle Sensor Platform (BSP) as an alternative, leveraging three key advantages: (1) the growing emphasis on cycling as a sustainable, healthy, and low-carbon urban mobility option, (2) bicycles can access both roads and cycling paths, especially in narrow streets where small vehicles are the only frequent and viable transit option, and (3) BSPs potential role in smart cities, mobility, and citizen-driven sensing. Using the smartphone’s accelerometer sensor placed in a cyclist’s backpack, combined with a novel analytical and machine learning model, we demonstrate that the BSP can accurately detect road irregularities such as manholes, bumps, and rumble strips, along with their physical characteristics (e.g., height/depth). Results highlight the BSP as a low-cost, scalable, and mobile sensor system that offers a novel approach to urban road anomaly detection. The continuous data stream from the BSP can help transportation authorities to quickly identify road defects, optimize maintenance schedules, and enhance infrastructure management."

Utilizing the constructed martingales, we derive a closed-form expression for the upper bound of the PAoI violation probability under the First-Come-First-Served scheduling policy. It is worth emphasizing that the proposed method is applicable where the service time of status update packets is independently and identically distributed or follows a Markov process. Numerical results verify the accuracy and generality of the proposed method in analyzing PAoI."

    "abstract": "With the evolution of 6G technologies, spectrum scarcity has emerged as a critical challenge. Semantic communication, as a content and task-oriented paradigm, offers a promising solution to alleviate spectrum limitations. We propose a novel resource allocation scheme based on a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-aware feature optimization mechanism (SFOM) for dynamic semantic image transmission (DSIT). To better characterize semantic transmission efficiency, we define a new performance metric, image semantic spectrum efficiency (ISSE), which employs semantic features as information conveyors rather than traditional bit-level representations. To maximize ISSE under image quality constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem involving multiple discrete variables, including compression ratio (CR), channel assignment, and power allocation. To address this problem, we develop an SFOM-driven proximal policy optimization (SFOM-PPO) algorithm that evaluates the significance of semantic feature channels and models the nonlinear relationships among the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), CR, and SINR, enabling adaptive semantic feature selection and optimal resource allocation under dynamic communication conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SFOM-PPO significantly outperforms baselines in ISSE performance, achieving an effective balance between image transmission quality and resource efficiency. This work provides initial insights into semantic spectral-efficient resource management and suggests a potential framework for future wireless semantic image transmission systems."

Historical 2024 generation and load data from a North American region (15-minute resolution) are used to train and evaluate the models. The LSTA integrates an attention module into the LSTM gate structure to emphasize temporally salient features in volatile renewable generation series. Predicted 24-hour profiles are incorporated into a day-ahead scheduling model that minimizes total system cost (curtailment, storage investment and charge/discharge cost). Compared with a baseline LSTM, the proposed LSTA reduces wind RMSE from 895.67 to 324.67 MW and solar RMSE from 109.58 to 58.24 MW. When used in the scheduling stage, LSTA forecasts lower the wind–solar curtailment rate (from 10.9% to 3.1%) and decrease total operational cost relative to the LSTM-based schedule. Results demonstrate that embedding attention into LSTM improves forecast fidelity for highly variable renewable outputs, which in turn yields measurable reductions in curtailment and system cost in coordinated dispatch. Key contributions include the gate-level attention design, the end-to-end prediction-to-scheduling evaluation, and a quantitative assessment of forecasting accuracy on dispatch outcomes."

It can be used to address the issue of insufficient battery life for mobile power-consuming equipment. However, the segment size of the long transmitting plate in the dynamic EC-WPT system is close to the high-frequency excitation wavelength. This proximity significantly affects the system due to the long-line effect. Besides, the system experiences new phenomena such as uneven spatial distribution of the coupling electric field and significant fluctuations in voltage/current, and these would pose a huge challenge to the stability of the system’s output voltage. This paper proposes a mathematical model for the dynamic EC-WPT system with a long transmitting plate based on transmission line theory, and presents a constant voltage output method for the dynamic EC-WPT system with a long transmitting plate under the influence of the long-line effect.

    "abstract": "In the face of fossil fuel depletion, improving energy efficiency is crucial to sustainable development. In AC electrified railway systems, the efficient allocation of Regenerative Braking Energy (RBE) is important to improve the energy efficiency and realize low-carbon transportation. Its level of optimization directly affects the system’s energy recovery efficiency and economic viability, making it highly significant for the development of sustainable transportation. However, current research in this field remains relatively limited, so it requires further exploration of more intelligent energy allocation strategies. To improve the utilization efficiency of regenerative braking energy in AC electrified railway systems, this paper proposes a power allocation method for substations based on Q-learning. The method first involves discretized modeling of the substation's energy state. At the same time, this paper has designed the action space according to the operational characteristics of the power distribution unit and introduced an ε-greedy strategy combined with an energy-saving-oriented reward function. All the above can guide the agent to progressively learn the optimal energy allocation policy through interaction. Simulation verification was conducted using a typical three-substation system. The results show that the Q- table effectively converges. And the learned policy exhibits good energy utilization efficiency and system adaptability in dynamic environments. The overall utilization rate of regenerative braking energy reaches 60%, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in improving energy recovery efficiency"

    "abstract": "Predictive management system plays a vital role in industry. Increasing the production rate of an industry is achieved by reducing the down time of the machine. Since the industrial machines are interconnected, faults in any one of the machine leads to massive production loss in the system. Apart from the incipient fault like short circuit due to surge voltage and over voltage, other faults like loss of break down strength of insulation medium due to ageing, mechanical bearing failure in machines due to vibrations, motor's winding insulation failure in motor due to core and copper losses are early predictable. In this article, prediction of air compressor failure is achieved by using the Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning algorithm with FX5U-32MT-ESS Programmable Logic Controller. Various sensors like CT/PT, temperature sensor (RTD), vibration sensor and encoders sensor data are fed to the FX5U controller. The RF ML model is trained by the training data set in colab platform. The training data is obtained from the compressors which are running in the industry and compressors which are in fault due to various above said reasons. The SD card mounted with the FX5U controller records the compressor data like current, voltage, power usage, temperature, vibration and speed. These data are used as a training and testing data for prediction of fault. The instantaneous values from the FX5U controller is fed to the RF algorithms as a test data for prediction."

Both the broadest application of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the emergent indoor positioning system, which can not be separated from the support of wireless positioning technology. Based on the demand for ubiquitous LBS from a wide range of users and the popularity of 5G networks in recent years, this paper develops an autonomous network positioning technology for B5G/6G applications. The development of the method ensures the performance of the positioning while lowering the cost of deployment, and breaks through the boundaries of 5G/6G applications. The field tests were carried out in an indoor large-scene environment to evaluate the performance of the developed system.

However, their acid value increases significantly during aging, compromising insulation performance. This study synthesized two ester oils—trimethylolpropane caprylic-nonanoic acid ester (TCNE) and pentaerythritol caprylic-nonanoic acid ester (PCNE)—via vacuum esterification, and investigated the effects of three representative acids (formic acid [C1], octanoic acid [C8], and nonanoic acid [C9]) on their oxidative stability. Results show that PCNE exhibits better thermal-oxidative resistance than TCNE. All acidic substances reduced the oxidation onset temperature and apparent activation energy, which accelerated degradation in insulation performance. C1 had the most significant impact, attributed to its strong polarity, acidity, and hydrophilicity."

Users subjectively set the weightings of these axes to reflect their own preferences, enabling personalized tonal harmony parsing.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) generates massive heterogeneous data from vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and sensors, requiring efficient fusion for accurate decision-making in intelligent transportation systems. Traditional fusion techniques struggle with high-dimensional, noisy, and redundant data, leading to increased computation and reduced reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Cross-Attentive Autoencoder (CAA) framework for multimodal data fusion in IoV environments. Autoencoders compress and denoise input data, providing latent representations, while the cross-attention mechanism establishes inter-feature correlations by leveraging query, key, and value mappings across modalities. This enhances contextual feature alignment and improves fusion accuracy. Experiments conducted on the Kaggle Passive Vehicle dataset and car parts image dataset demonstrate a 35% reduction in data size, while maintaining robust feature representation. Visualization through heatmaps and latent embeddings confirms the interpretability of fused outputs. The proposed model outperforms conventional approaches by achieving effective noise reduction, efficient compression, and accurate fusion for IoV applications. Future work will focus on extending the framework to advanced autoencoder variants and integrating it with 6 G -enabled IoV architectures for real-time, scalable deployment."

Traditional hash-based SpGEMM methods face several challenges, including frequent hash table accesses during the symbolic phase, high-overhead sorting operations in the numeric phase, and imbalanced workload distribution across threads. To address these issues, we propose a highly optimized SpGEMM method-MH-SpGEMM. Unlike conventional approaches, MH-SpGEMM introduces a mask-based storage format for matrix <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$B$</tex> during the symbolic phase and uses bitwise OR operations to efficiently calculate the number of nonzeros in the result matrix. In the numeric phase, a bitonic sort algorithm is employed for rows with many nonzeros to improve sorting efficiency. Furthermore, MH-SpGEMM incorporates a finer-grained load balancing strategy. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MHSpGEMM against four state-of-the-art SpGEMM methods (HSMU-SpGEMM, OpSparse, nsparse, and cuSPARSE) on two NVIDIA GPUs(Ada Lovelace, Ampere). The results demonstrate that MH-SpGEMM consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of performance."

The connection between electrolyzer plants and electric-driven compressor stations (EDCSs) is a key interaction between these sectors. This work, for the first time, explores the dynamics of a coupled electrolyzer-EDCS system. The developed model analyzes the dynamics of the integrated system when the compressor station is faced with power grid disturbances. Simulation outcomes reveal that the coupled electrolyzer-EDCS system works perfectly in normal conditions. However, the system is unable to appropriately respond to unexpected changes when the EDCS faces a disturbance from the power sector side. The identified issue is due to the lack of a proper control link between the electrolyzer and EDCS.

Jamsostek Mobile (JMO), which facilitates BPJS Ketenagakerjaan services in Indonesia, has recently integrated advanced features such as facial recognition for identity verification and streamlined claim processing, making the understanding of user sentiment increasingly important. This study aims to enhance sentiment analysis for the JMO Mobile app by employing a systematic approach. The Random Forest algorithm is applied to two datasets containing 2,000 and 20,000 user reviews, respectively. Key steps include resolving class imbalance, optimizing hyperparameters, and assessing how dataset size influences model accuracy. The best performance, 92% accuracy, was attained with a 10% validation split on the larger dataset. In addition to accuracy, evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also analyzed to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance. The results highlight Random Forest's effectiveness in sentiment classification and offer practical recommendations for improving similar applications. This research contributes by demonstrating how Random Forest can efficiently evaluate user sentiment in large-scale app reviews, providing implications for the development of sentiment analysis methods and future improvements in mobile-based public services."

In this paper, we will describe the process of integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) into a hybrid approach to secure communications in the post-quantum world. The suggested methodology is a combination of the computational efficiency and scalability of PQC and the information-theoretic security and eavesdropping detection abilities of QKD. Simulation observations indicate that PQC-only systems are both faster in generating keys and scalable, but do not have a strong eavesdropping detection. On the other hand, non-conditional security is only a feature of systems based on QKD, but it is also highly overhead and slows down key rate. The hybrid PQC-Q KD model provides a balanced performance, high resilience, high authentication, high confidentiality, and realistic deployability. On balance, this discussion demonstrates that the hybrid approach is better than standalone methods and can provide a strong solution to protect against new quantum threats. The large-scale network protocol can be optimized, resources and further integration with other emerging technologies, such as 5G/6G, IoT or cloud computing, can be directed in future research."

Attendees of the school utilized a suite of complementary measurement techniques, ranging from electrical characterization to advanced imaging techniques such as drone infrared (IR), magnetic field imaging (MFI) and electroluminescence (EL). These were applied to four residential photovoltaic (PV) installations. By leveraging the strengths of each method, the study demonstrates how multimodal assessments enable a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of module degradation, electrical anomalies and electrical failures. Faults such as microcracks, inactive cell areas, broken interconnects and semiconductor failures were identified and cross-validated across techniques. For instance, MFI confirmed current path disruptions identified using current-voltage (I-V) tracing, and EL-detected semiconductor breakdowns were linked to IR hotspots. This approach improves ambiguity in fault attribution. The findings of this study applied to residential PV installations provide actionable insights for reliability analysis, predictive maintenance, decommissioning and quality assurance of PVs."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of global climate change and energy transition, the government of Taiwan has announced its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with a planned installation capacity of 20 GW for solar power and 5.6 GW for offshore wind. However, the integration of a high share of intermittent renewable energy sources poses significant threats to grid stability. To mitigate systemic risks, Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) has implemented various measures, including the launch of an electricity trading platform in 2021. This initiative encourages private investment in energy storage systems and participation in demand response programs, particularly to mitigate anticipated evening peak loads and prevent supply-demand imbalances. In northern Taiwan, where population density is high and land availability for power plant construction is limited, the traditional strategy has relied heavily on south-to-north power transmission. Nevertheless, the localized nature of renewable energy installations is gradually steering the power system toward distributed generation. Microgrid technologies have thus emerged as a key solution, offering advantages such as reduced line losses, enhanced energy autonomy, and decreased dependence on the main grid. Under conditions of heavy reliance on imported fuels, microgrids also play a crucial role in mitigating energy risk. Additionally, microgrids can feed power back to the main grid when necessary, functioning as backup systems to support grid stability while generating revenue from the sale of electricity. This study investigates the feasibility of implementing a microgrid system in a convenience store setting, integrating solar PV, wind power, and energy storage. Using the Homer software platform for renewable energy simulation, both technical and economic analyses are conducted to assess the system’s applicability in commercial electricity usage scenarios. The goal is to provide practical strategies and empirical insights to support Taiwan’s ongoing energy transition."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a financial optimization framework for residential photovoltaic (PV), battery energy storage (BESS), and energy management systems (EMS), applied to 2,400 real-world Belgian household profiles with 15-minute resolution. For each profile, the PV and BESS sizes that maximize net present value (NPV) are determined, considering investment costs, technical constraints, and realistic tariff structures, including capacity-based charges.Thirty scenarios are evaluated in total, including 27 combinations of electricity tariffs and EMS configurations, as well as 3 scenarios with alternative BESS cost assumptions. Results show that PV is financially viable for most households without existing installations (90.9% at default prices), while BESS profitability is limited and highly cost-sensitive. EMS integration substantially improves NPV by shifting flexible loads and reducing peak demand, often eliminating the need for BESS.The findings support a phased investment strategy and highlight the importance of EMS functionality in enhancing the economic viability of residential energy systems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Fault diagnosis in integrated circuits (ICs) has become increasingly challenging due to the growing complexity of modern circuit designs, particularly in the presence of defects caused by scaling and environmental factors. Our approach begins with the construction of a Bayesian Network to model the probabilistic relationships between various components of the IC, capturing the dependencies and uncertainties inherent in the fault diagnosis process. Bayesian Networks provide a flexible framework for reasoning under uncertainty, which is essential for diagnosing faults in complex IC systems where diagnostic data is often incomplete or noisy. Once the network structure is established, Simulated Annealing is used to optimize the model's parameters, focusing on improving the fault localization accuracy and reducing the diagnostic errors. These datasets include various types of faults, ranging from stuck-at faults to open and short circuits, and they allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach in both digital and analog fault diagnosis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method achieves significant improvements in diagnostic performance compared to baseline techniques. Specifically, our method improves diagnostic accuracy by an average of 10 percentage points, with notable gains in fault localization precision and robustness under noisy conditions. Further analysis shows that the proposed model not only outperforms traditional methods, such as fault tree analysis and machine learning-based techniques, but also provides better scalability and computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale IC systems. In particular, the combination of Bayesian Networks and Simulated Annealing helps to overcome local optima, ensuring global optimization of the diagnostic process. The model's ability to handle uncertainty and incomplete data, coupled with its optimization-driven fault localization, provides a promising solution for real-time IC fault diagnosis in industrial applications. The proposed hybrid approach is capable of addressing the complexities of modern IC designs and offers a robust solution for both digital and analog fault diagnosis, making it a valuable contribution to the field of integrated circuit testing and maintenance."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a secure framework for geofenced data encryption that integrates cryptographic hashing and multi-channel steganography to enforce location-bound decryption. The system ensures that encrypted data can only be accessed when the user is physically present at authorized geographic coordinates, validated through cryptographic hash comparisons. A master encryption key is fragmented and concealed across multiple media files image, audio, video using least significant bit (LSB) steganography, while GPS coordinates are hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 and embedded within the image metadata. During decryption, the framework verifies the user’s location by comparing real-time GPS hashes with stored values and reconstructs the key only if all fragments are retrieved from the distributed steganographic carriers. The system demonstrates defense-in-depth security through three layers: geofencing via cryptographic hashing, key fragmentation, and multi-modal steganography. Experimental results show robust resistance to brute-force attacks, steganalysis, and location spoofing, making it suitable for applications requiring stringent physical-logical access control, such as military communications, IoT device security, and confidential document sharing."

Extending recent approaches that utilize generalized polymatroids, a family of polytopes, to represent the aggregate flexibility of EV populations, we show how to integrate network constraints into this representation to obtain network-constrained aggregate flexibility sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to optimize over these network-constrained aggregate flexibility sets, and propose a disaggregation procedure that maps an aggregate load profile to individual EV dispatch instructions, while respecting both device-level and network constraints."

The dual-objective model minimizes maintenance cost and maximizes reliability by optimizing opportunistic maintenance reliability thresholds. An Multi-Strategy Improved Dung Beetle Optimization algorithm incorporating Bernoulli mapping, improved sine strategy, nonlinear convergence factors, and Gaussian-Cauchy mutation is developed for solution.

    "abstract": "Producers of renewable plants can enhance their profits by submitting accurate production profiles to the day-ahead energy markets. However, potential deviations between day-ahead forecasts and actual power generation result in power imbalances, which are penalized in the balancing market. To address this issue, this work proposes an operating strategy for over-installed renewable plants with battery energy storage systems (BESSs) to reduce power imbalances and thereby enhance the profits of producers. Specifically, a linear optimization scheme is developed to minimize power deficits during real-time operation by scheduling the charging and discharging power set-points of the BESS. The proposed scheme is implemented within a model predictive control framework using updated renewable forecasts. Moreover, a secondary controller is integrated into the proposed approach to store the renewable generation that exceeds the maximum export limits, eliminating power generation curtailments. The proposed strategy is applied to a wind power plant using real data. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed operating strategy to yield high-quality solutions under power generation uncertainty, enhancing profits by 4.2% and reducing power imbalances by 17.8%."

With recent advancements in smart farming and automation, machine learning techniques along with IOT have emerged as powerful tools for precision agriculture. Weed presence in agricultural lands is one of the main reasons for lost productivity and efficiency for the growth of plants. Unfortunately, current methods of weed detection and elimination are not accessible to most farms or too expensive to replicate. This paper presents a remotecontrolled weed detection and elimination system designed specifically for potato crops. By utilizing low-cost components such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino we minimize the cost as well as make the system more scalable. To enhance real-time weed detection, we employ YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 models comparing their accuracy and precision. Additionally, we also conduct a literature-based performance review of Faster RCNN and YOLOv3 models highlighting the trade-offs in speed and accuracy."

    "abstract": "As real-world networks grow in size and complexity, large graphs present significant computational challenges. Graph sparsification is a common strategy for addressing this by reducing the number of edges while preserving the essential structure. Existing methods are mostly edge-centric and rely on global metrics such as edge connectivity. This paper proposes a vertex-centric framework that preserves dominant neighborhoods using the k-Weighted Dominating Set (k-WDS) approach. Our approach retains all edges incident to the selected set, with the Iterated Greedy (IG) heuristic used to approximate the NP-hard minimum k-WDS problem. Theoretical analysis shows that k-WDS sparsification maintains connectivity and provides formal bounds on feasible <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex> values. Experiments on the Cora and PubMed datasets demonstrate that this method offers a tunable and effective preprocessing step for graph neural networks."

    "abstract": "The European Union's climate and energy policies, including the European Green Deal and the European Climate Law, emphasise the urgent need for building sector transformation to meet greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Smart buildings, enabled by Information and Communication Technologies, play a crucial role in enhancing energy efficiency, user comfort, and grid flexibility. The Smart Readiness Indicator, introduced under the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, is a tool for evaluating a building's capacity to promote energy performance, respond to the needs of occupants, and interact with the energy grid. This study explores the readiness of seven European Union countriesr—Greece, Spain, Czechia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia—to adopt and implement the Smart Readiness Indicator framework. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach, specifically the TOPSIS method, is employed, incorporating social, political, economic, and technological indicators, in order to rank these countries in terms of their SRI readiness level. The Smart Readiness Indicator assessment methodology is examined in depth, highlighting its structure, scoring process, and evaluation techniques. Through a coherent set of criteria and comparative analysis, this research identifies the strengths and barriers in each country's legislative framework, public awareness, and renewable energy engagement. The results aim to support policymakers and stakeholders in tailoring national strategies for the effective rollout of the Smart Readiness Indicator and broader smart building initiatives."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative network intrusion/anomaly detection in distributed systems, particularly under privacy constraints and data decentralization. Recent semi-supervised FL approaches with autoencoders (AEs) have shown strong potential in this setting. Nevertheless, many of these methods rely on only a single scoring signal, such as reconstruction error (RE) or latent representation z, which often results in unstable detection. To address this, we propose an enhanced federated anomaly detection framework named as Federated Learning with Hybrid Scoring based Shrink AutoEncoder (FedSAE-HS) that applies both RE and latent vector z for calculating an anomaly score. The hybrid scoring strategy allows the model to be sensitive to subtle anomalies, improving detection stability and generalization. We evaluate FedSAE-HS on two benchmark IDS datasets, N-BaIoT and WSN_DS, against four existing federated anomaly detection frameworks. Experimental results show that FedSAEHS achieves superior performance in AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and False Positive Rate, while converging more stably, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid scoring strategy for semi-supervised federated anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "Hallucinations in generative AI refer to outputs that are linguistically well-formed but factually incorrect. In educational contexts, such content poses a critical epistemic risk, as it may be mistakenly accepted as accurate, especially by learners and, to a lesser degree, by instructors. This paper introduces a formal Venn-theoretic framework to model the interaction among four knowledge domains: factual knowledge (D), AI-generated content (G), and student's knowledge (S). The model identifies user-centred epistemic states, such as when learners learn and assimilate hallucinated content, which constitute what we term as epistemic risks that are due to Generative AI hallucinations within the educational process. These states are formalised as distinct regions within the Venn space, supporting both descriptive modelling of observed behaviour and normative analysis of ideal conditions. By focusing on the human-AI interface in educational use, the framework offers a structured approach to analysing how misinformation propagates through cognitive and instructional flows. It also informs the design of mitigation strategies, including instructor oversight, content verification, and alignment with emerging regulatory risk frameworks."

This study addresses the fundamental trade-off between energy independence and system efficiency in photovoltaic (PV)-electrolyzer systems. We investigated the impact of electricity grid connection on the risk and sizing of PV-electrolyzer systems for industrial energy supply. A multi-method approach was applied, combining fault tree analysis of grid-connected and stand-alone configurations with a system sizing model based on an industrial demand profile. Results revealed that grid fault contributed minimally to total system risk, whereas off-grid configurations demanded oversizing of PV and electrolyzer capacities — up to 17× and 6× the average demand, respectively. The findings suggest that while off-grid systems are technically feasible, their complexity and cost (levelized cost of hydrogen ~ 15 $/kg H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>) raise questions about practicality under standard conditions.

This comprehensive review synthesises recent advancements in AI-driven back support exoskeletons specifically designed for agricultural applications, evaluating their biomechanical efficacy in reducing lumbosacral loads during farm-specific tasks. The analysis covers intelligent control strategies, machine learning (ML)-based adaptation algorithms, sensor fusion techniques, and real-time biofeedback systems integrated into modern agricultural exoskeletons. Multiple studies demonstrate significant electromyographic (EMG) reductions ranging from 17% to 65% in laboratory settings and 35% to 56% in field trials. AI-driven systems show superior adaptation to varying agricultural tasks compared to conventional designs. The review reveals that intelligent exoskeletons with crop-specific programming, terrain adaptation, and predictive load assistance significantly reduce injury risk while maintaining productivity in farming operations. The convergence of AI technology and wearable robotics represents a critical advancement toward sustainable, worker-centric farming practices."

In this article, we develop a methodology that can manage fundus, thermal, and skin cancer-related images using the recommendations of the DICOM standard, which consists of including metadata such as data on the equipment used to record the image, data on the doctor who recommended the examination, data on the image record, data on the image request, and data on the date of the image record. This data is generated in an application so that it can be stored in a PostgreSQL database, designed to fulfil the functionality of a PACS medical image server, Using optimisation and data storage management techniques, we present the database structure, image management processes such as image registration, storage and retrieval, demonstrating the operability and practicality of the proposal. As conclusions, we present how the methodology can be exploited, enabling the configuration of PACS servers in private or low-resource health centres to purchase commercial licences, as well as integration and interoperability with commercial PACS systems."

    "abstract": "This work presents a deep learning-based framework for the macroscopic design of transmissive metasurfaces to enable the transformation of a given incident wave into a farfield power pattern that resides within a user-defined mask. This neural network then directly generates the required metasurface properties, known as surface susceptibilities, that (i) satisfy reciprocity, losslessness, and passivity conditions, and (ii) result in high transmission efficiency. An important part of this neural network is a fast metasurface forward solver, known as the implicit IE-GSTC method, that combines the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) with the integral equation (IE) formulation to calculate the metasurface scattering response. The achieved macroscopic designs show promising results under the ideal zerothickness scenario. However, the far-field performance degrades as the zero-thickness model is converted into a finite-thickness three-layered model. This discrepancy may be attributed to the assumption of perpendicular wave propagation in the generation of our utilized finite-thickness metasurface model."

    "abstract": "The development of DeepFake media poses a significant danger to digital safety, citizen trust, and the precision of the forensics. The fix to the problem is to possess a performance of detection that is high enough and trust to the process. In this paper, the ResNet50 and the Vision Transformer (ViT) would be compared in image detection of DeepFake using two existing datasets. To help in the interpretability of the model predictions, we apply explainable AI (XAI) models LIME and SHAP to discover what areas of the face mattered in the model predictions. The results of the experiment indicate that ResNet50 achieves the accuracy of 99.15, F1-score of 99.15, and the area under the curve (AUC) of 99.9. ViT also works even better with $99.3 \\%$ accuracy, $99.9 \\%$ F1-score, and $99.9 \\%$ AUC. After the analysis of the confusion matrices, it was found that ViT was more resistant to subtle changes, which may be explained by its self-attention mechanism, which helped it consider relationships between faces on a global scale. Another level of confidence was also used, which XAI represents the fact that the models were examining meaningful facial locations, enhancing model interpretability and user trust. In general, the presented work reflects a detection framework, which is credible and clear-cut in its methodology, which eventually results in the state-of-theart findings in a key consumer trust application, which connects performance and explanation."

We propose an efficient inversion strategy that utilizes off-axis illumination to capture dark-field images from multiple angles. To manage the computational burden, the region of interest is divided into subregions, where Born approximation provides an initial guess. Nonlinear inverse algorithms are then used in each subregion, incorporating the influence from neighboring subregions. Additionally, computational efficiency is enhanced by truncating the far-field Green's function when the transverse distance between the source and observation points is large, transforming the scattered field calculation into a convolution operation. This approach can reduce memory usage while maintaining inversion performance. which makes large-scale inverse scattering simulations more practical for biological imaging applications."

This paper focuses on designing a high-efficiency WPT system based on magnetic resonance coupling (MRC). While conventional studies improve efficiency by adjusting the distance between the driving loop and the transmit coil, this paper highlights a novel method of enhancing efficiency through radius optimization of the driving loop. By tuning the loop radius according to different transfer distances, the system achieves improved coupling coefficient and higher efficiency. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method achieves a relative improvement of approximately 38% over the baseline system efficiency, while maintaining consistent performance across various transmission distances. The proposed radius-tuning approach provides a simple yet effective means of optimizing coil geometry without requiring complex control strategies or system modifications, offering promising applicability for wireless charging of electric vehicles and consumer electronics."

However, traditional methods rely heavily on expert analysis, making them timeconsuming and inconsistent. Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have improved classification accuracy but often struggle to capture both the global dependencies and local cellular structures in complex bone marrow images. To resolve these issues, we propose CMTBMC, a Convolutional Multi-Head Transformer model that combines the powerful multi-head attention mechanism of Transformers with the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs. Our approach effectively captures fine-grained details while maintaining contextual relationships across the image. We evaluate CMT-BMC on the AML-Cytomorphology labeled dataset, consisting of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 8, 3 6 5}$</tex> bone marrow cell images covering multiple leukemia subtypes.

Additionally, the multihead self-attention mechanism enhances interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cellular features.

    "abstract": "Contemporary Ethernet networks rely on traffic classification techniques based on packet labeling fields such as the Type of Service (ToS). These mechanisms, while effective in prioritizing latency-sensitive flows, are vulnerable to manipulation. Malicious actors can falsely label low-priority traffic as highpriority (e.g., Voice or Video), thereby gaining unfair access to bandwidth and degrading network fairness. This study introduces a machine learning approach for anomaly detection, leveraging behavioral attributes of packets-such as size, interarrival time, and protocol port-to identify suspicious misclassifications. A comprehensive dataset was generated using the D-ITGBox traffic creation tool, emulating audio (G.721), video (H.264), background (ICMP), and best-effort (HTTP/Telnet) flows. Additionally, two anomalous datasets were synthesized by modifying the ToS fields of background and best-effort traffic to falsely represent them as voice and video, respectively. Three deep learning models-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks-were trained and evaluated across 50 randomized iterations. Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were analyzed. To validate performance differences, non-parametric statistical tests (Friedman and Wilcoxon) were applied. Results revealed that LSTM achieved superior recall and F1-score, indicating robust detection of sequential anomalies, while MLP excelled in precision. CNN demonstrated balanced but more variable performance. The findings advocate the application of deep learning models for Ethernet-based anomaly detection and set the groundwork for hybrid approaches and deployment in real-time environments."

First, the auxiliary slot subdomain is added. By combining the vector field general solutions of each subdomain and listing the boundary conditions, the calculation formulas for EMF are obtained. Then, the calculation results of the proposed model are compared with the FE simulation results to systematically verify the accuracy and applicability of the model under different working conditions. Finally, the effects of auxiliary slot parameters are studied in combination with the proposed model. The research in this paper provides theoretical basis and technical reference for effectively suppressing the electromagnetic vibration and noise of PMSM."

    "abstract": "Experiments in visualization perception demonstrate that people can perceive positions highly accurately. However, position encodings can be susceptible to systematic biases depending on the intrinsic properties of the visualized data, such as its shape and cognitive processes of memory and perception. Using line charts as a case study, we investigate how the shape of data, such as local and global extrema, can bias the perception and recall of average data values. In two studies, participants estimated the average data values in a line chart by adjusting a slider with their mouse. We found that participants’ estimates were systematically biased toward the direction of the global extremum. When multiple salient extrema were present, estimates appeared influenced by several extrema simultaneously but ultimately leaned toward the global extremum. Notably, the strength of this bias varied depending on whether participants were perceiving or recalling the mean. This work advances our understanding of how extrema influence perception and memory, potentially exaggerating or underestimating critical trends and contributing to a skewed interpretation of data. These findings offer valuable guidance for the design of narrative visualization tools and data storytelling strategies."

However, the assessment of these aspects often remains fragmented, causing a significant gap between comprehensive academic theories and the pragmatic, resource-constrained practices of industry professionals. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a conceptual model that systematically integrates UI, usability, and UX evaluation methods into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We adopted a qualitative approach, beginning with a literature review and strengthened by semi-structured interviews with ten industry experts to gain an understanding of current practices. The proposed model addresses these issues by mapping specific evaluation types to holistic assessments by distinct SDLC phases. This model consists of two principles: attitudes and behaviors, which operate in a continuous, iterative cycle. While this model provides a strong foundation, we recommend further validation through real-world case studies to enhance its reliability and practical utility."

Most approaches commonly rely on State of Health (SOH) and State of Charge (SOC) methods to estimate battery storage. A significant problem was identified: when the battery level is low, there is no reliable method to identify the nearest charging station. In order to get around this restriction, a new function was added that uses GPS tracking to direct users to the nearest charging station in real time. In a situation where people driving on bypass roads use GPS to locate the best EV charging stations. The main objective is to provide a model that offers a live guide for finding the closest EV charging station. When applied in paired with traffic simulations, the method can be extremely helpful for service providers, allowing them to efficiently optimize the positioning of charging stations through model performance and assessment."

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has drastically raised the requirement for effective charging infrastructure that has put a lot of stress on the power grids we have now. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology could be the answer because it lets energy flow in both directions between EVs and the grid. This assists in keeping the grid stable while making it simpler to use energy from the sun and wind. The current study aims to enhance V2G power transmission for prolonged EV charging operations through the implementation of intricate time scheduling, load management, as well as energy trading algorithms. To keep the battery healthy, a framework over multi-objective optimization is made to minimize peak demand, lower charging costs, and to make the most of renewable energy. The proposed system employs real-time information about the grid, predictions of how much renewable energy will be generated, and dynamic pricing structures to keep the flow of electricity balanced. The simulation results show that the optimization technique makes the grid considerably more dependable, cuts down on expenses, and helps cut down on carbon emissions when compared to standard unidirectional charging systems. The results demonstrate that optimizing based on V2G could be a key part of making energy ecosystems smarter and more sustainable. This would help make cities smarter and more eco-friendly, as well as make electricity networks stronger."

    "abstract": "In everyday life, many problems require optimization, often involving multiple conflicting objective functions that must be addressed simultaneously. For example, a phone company wants to improve the camera quality while trying to minimize the production cost at the same time. Numerous algorithms have been proposed to address multi-objective optimization problems. However, the “No Free Lunch” theorem states that no single algorithm can solve all problems equally well. KMA and CSA are two algorithms that have shown effectiveness in solving optimization problems; however, their applications remain limited to single-objective problems. This study presented a hybrid Komodo Mlipir Algorithm and Circle Search Algorithm using non-dominated sorting approach (KMA-CSA-NDS) for solving multi-objective optimization problems. The algorithm is designed to take advantage of the Komodo Mlipir algorithm's (KMA) quick convergence ability while also incorporating the Circle Search algorithm's (CSA) strengths in exploring the solution space and avoiding local optima, and it utilizes non-dominated sorting as a multi-objective approach. In the experimental phase, five ZDT functions are utilized. KMA-CSA-NDS successfully approached the Pareto front (PF) and produced minimal GD values for four ZDT functions."

    "abstract": "Pulse generators are often used in timing control circuits. The traditional pulse generators consume more power due to the redundant switching activities. With a signal transition from high to low or low to high, more energy is drawn from the power supply, resulting in frequent switching across the internal circuitry and higher energy dissipation. This work proposes three dual-edge-triggered pulsed latch (DET PL) designs to minimize the power and transistor count. The proposed designs are modified with and without a pseudo-nMOS transistor in the pulse generation circuitry, along with the inverters at the input and output of the main latch. The use of pseudo-nMOS transistors along with inverters ensures that the pulse signal and the output are stable. The circuits are realized in Cadence Virtuoso at the CMOS 90 nm technology node and simulated using Cadence Spectre with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The proposed design-I (DET PL-I) achieves a power reduction of 19.8 %, while the proposed design-II (DET PL-II) and proposed design-III (DET PL-III) achieve a 30.24 % and 13.49 % reduction in power, respectively, compared to the existing DET circuits. Apart from reducing the power, the proposed designs also minimize the area, resulting in more efficient integration into the present systems."

This study investigates in detail the influence of electrode number, target conductivity, and the size of the target region on the accuracy of absolute imaging with Calderón’s method. The results demonstrate that all these factors significantly affect the accuracy of the reconstructed images. Furthermore, to address modeling errors arising during pulmonary respiration, the robustness of Calderón’s method under boundary perturbations is examined.

    "abstract": "Global weather forecasting remains one of the most complicated scientific problems due to the non-linear, chaotic, and multiscale dynamics of the atmosphere. Conventional numerical methods dominate the weather forecasting world, but they are not only very computationally expensive, they frequently cannot capture small-scale features in space and time especially in medium-to-long range forecasts. Recent developments in deep learning provide new opportunities; however, existing models seldom consider hierarchical spatio-temporal dependencies, quantify predictive uncertainty, or efficiently produce situationally aware, high-resolution climate forecasts. This work offers the AtmoNeuro model - a novel, hybrid neural model combining three-dimensional convolutional networks to capture localized spatial dynamics with spatio-temporal attention transformers (that are in part inspired by hierarchical Swin architectures), to model long-range atmospheric dependencies, and stochastic representation learning modules to produce probabilistic forecasts and uncertainty. The model framework also includes diffusion-based refinement methods to improve the spatial resolution of the predictions, along with enhancing the physical realism of the predictions. In extensive experiments on large-scale global atmospheric datasets, we find that AtmoNeuro consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy, robustness, and reliability in out-of-distribution scenarios. This research will not only advance performance improvements in forecasts and models, it provides a foundation for interpretable, scalable, and high-fidelity weather modeling which will be valuable for a diverse range of scientists and practitioners. AtmoNeuro bridges traditional meteorological insights with modern neural architectures, paving the way to explore multi-modal climate modeling, real-time probabilistic forecasting, as well as developing AI-based decision support systems for environmental and disaster response planning."

These cooperatives typically sell the electricity they generate to their customers through pay-as-produced power purchase agreements. However, the increasing frequency of low and negative electricity prices can incentivise customers to curtail their offtake from the cooperative, posing a financial risk to the cooperative’s business model. The deployment of Battery Energy Storage Systems is proposed as a mitigation strategy in such contexts. This paper investigates various BESS ownership and operational models, quantifies the associated cost savings, and assesses the potential reduction in curtailment volumes. The findings indicate that integrating BESS can significantly lower power offtake costs and reduce energy curtailment. Furthermore, the study examines how different operational strategies influence total energy costs and highlights the need to investigate profit-sharing mechanisms between cooperatives and BESS owners."

    "abstract": "Discovering all Frequent High Average-Utility Occupancy Itemsets (FHAUOIs) in quantitative transaction databases has emerged as a promising direction in pattern mining. By integrating both average-utility occupancy and frequency, these itemsets are better aligned with real-world applications, as they not only represent the preferences of the majority of users but also contribute significantly to the total utility of input transactions in which they appear. However, the set of exploited FHAUOIs can be extremely large, especially when dealing with dense or large-scale datasets, or when low minimum threshold values are used. This can make it difficult for users to interpret and utilize the results effectively. To overcome this challenge, the paper designs a novel algorithm called C-FHAUOIM for mining Closed FHAUOIs (CFHAUOIs). The algorithm leverages a newly designed upper bound on average-utility occupancy to efficiently reduce the database by eliminating low-average-utility occupancy items. In addition, it introduces a novel weak lower bound, along with associated pruning strategies, to effectively discard non-closed FHAUOIs early in the mining process. These theoretical advances are integrated into an efficient algorithm for discovering CFHAUOIs. Experimental evaluations conducted on multiple synthetic and real quantitative databases reveal that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the baseline, particularly in execution speed, memory efficiency, and scalability."

To address this issue, this paper proposes an intelligent stack-up recognition method based on large language models (LLMs), which automatically converts PCB stack-up information into a standardized format defined by users or manufacturers. Experimental results demonstrate that online LLMs with over 500 billion parameters achieve a high recognition accuracy, exceeding 92%. In scenarios demanding data confidentiality or facing computational constraints, locally deployed lightweight models are a preferable alternative. However, models with no more than 8 billion parameters exhibit a significantly lower accuracy of below 37%, which is insufficient for practical purposes. Therefore, further investigation is essential to improve the viability of local lightweight models for this application."

Firstly, a discrete linear parameter varying (LPV) model is established based on the system dynamics to characterize the nonlinear behavior of the crane. Meanwhile, the external and internal uncertainties of the system are modeled as unknown bounded (UB) disturbances. Secondly, a novel SAC-MPC collaborative anti-sway control framework is designed. The framework incorporates the constraint-handling capability of MPC and the self-optimizing nature of SAC to enforce state constraints and generate optimized control signals. Besides, an SAC training paradigm with state space noise injection is introduced to enhance the control policy’s adaptability to environmental uncertainties.

    "abstract": "Motion planning for autonomous vision-based car racing is a challenging task in robotics. Classical racing systems divide the task into numerous submodules, undermining computational efficiency and leading to error propagation. Previous studies have demonstrated impressive reinforcement learning (RL) results for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, RL exhibits poor scalability on high-dimensional data, such as images, and it is challenging to learn optimal racing behaviors due to the lack of global information about the environments. To address these issues, a two-phase learning paradigm is proposed in this work to train a vision-based racing policy. First, RL trains a teacher policy that integrates progress maximization with collision avoidance in the reward function and utilizes privileged information (P.I.) about the racetrack to achieve high-performance racing. Then, a student policy, relying only on an ego-centric depth camera for perception, is trained by distilling racing knowledge from the teacher policy. The student policy achieves high-speed drive, high success rate, and smooth control in vision-based racing games. The proposed approach is validated in the simulation and on a real-world 1/10-scale race car, showing that the approach outperforms previous model-based and learning-based baselines."

First, an analytical method is developed to characterize the spatial distribution of circumferential electromagnetic force waves in the air gap, and a spatial-order-based transfer function is constructed to describe the mechanical vibration response. Building upon this, a mechanism-informed neural network architecture is proposed, incorporating prior knowledge into a self-supervised framework, with constrained hidden nodes and learnable edge activation functions. This hybrid design enhances both prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that the mechanism-informed architecture achieves over 98% prediction accuracy on experimental data sets. Moreover, the model provides interpretable insights into vibration transmission mechanisms, offering guidance for interaction analysis and collaborative optimization of variable PWM control parameters."

Fully differential transconductors having voltage-biased nMOS transistors form the input differential pair with a pair of pMOS transistors forming the active load. The gyrators’ common-mode (CM) response is kept under 0 dB at low frequencies by CM feedback (CMFB) loops. A pair of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\approx }300$</tex-math> </inline-formula> pH inductors and a capacitor, strategically shared among all transconductors, are used to sense and reject the high-frequency CM currents through the filter and provide CM stabilization at high frequencies. This extends the CM stability of the gyrators beyond the unity-gain bandwidth (UGB) of the CMFB loops. Another technique to relax the capacitance budget of the heavily loaded resistively terminated node of a leap-frog architecture is introduced. Background servo loops ensure automatic tracking and stabilization of the (trans) conductances across changes in ambient conditions. The efficacy of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through a singly terminated third-order Chebyshev low-pass filter implemented in a standard 65 nm bulk CMOS process operating with a fixed supply voltage of 1.1 V. The filter achieves a maximum −3 dB BW of 15.5 GHz, improving the state of the art by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\gt } 1.5{\\times }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>. The filter’s BW is tunable from 2.7 to 15.5 GHz while faithfully preserving its response shape. Its measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies between 38 and 44 dB while consuming 31–291 mW of power between its minimum and maximum BW settings, respectively. Furthermore, the filter can also be reconfigured as a bandpass, with tunable center frequencies between 2.5 and 13.4 GHz."

The problem of cooperation typically involves pairwise or group interactions among individuals. While prior studies have extensively investigated the role of networks in shaping cooperative dynamics, the influence of tie or connection strengths between individuals has not been fully understood. Here, we introduce a quenched mean-field based framework for analyzing both pairwise and group dilemmas on any weighted network, providing interpretable conditions required for favoring cooperation. Our theoretical advances further motivate us to find that the degree-inverse weighted social ties – reinforcing tie strengths between peripheral nodes while weakening those between hubs – robustly promote cooperation in both pairwise and group dilemmas. Importantly, this configuration enables heterogeneous networks to outperform homogeneous ones in fixation of cooperation, thereby adding to the conventional view that degree heterogeneity inhibits cooperative behavior under the local stochastic strategy update. We further test the generality of degree-inverse weighted social ties in promoting cooperation on <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$30, 000$</tex-math></inline-formula> random networks and 13 empirical networks drawn from real-world systems.

    "abstract": "The security of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is crucial to ensure the safety of individual robotic systems and the reliability of the environment in which they operate. Although Secure ROS2 (SROS2) enhances security via Data Distribution Service Security for authentication, access control, and data encryption, it has several limitations. The complexity of managing security artifacts and the degradation of communication performance are two primary concerns. To address these challenges, we propose the ROS2 Security (ROS2Sec) module, which enhances ROS2 security while minimizing communication performance degradation. ROS2Sec introduces centralized authentication management and group-based access-control, thus reducing the number of security artifacts from seven for SROS2 to only three, thereby simplifying management. Additionally, ROS2Sec employs the Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode at the ROS2 message level to optimize data confidentiality while minimizing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ROS2Sec prevents unauthorized access from malicious ROS2 nodes, reduces the mean communication latency by approximately 9% compared with SROS2, and maintains stable performance even as the number of subscribers increases. These findings confirm that ROS2Sec balances security and communication performance and is a practical solution for secure and efficient ROS2-based robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in military surveillance and disaster early warning. However, due to the low data rate, high latency, and instability of underwater acoustic communication, UASNs are highly vulnerable to cascading failures triggered by the malfunction of key nodes, which can lead to network collapse. To address this challenge, we establish a cascading failure model tailored for dynamic traffic UASNs and propose a multi-criteria key node prediction (MC-KNP) algorithm based on the novel finding that nodes exhibit varying importance levels under different network traffic conditions. Although experimental results demonstrate that MC-KNP algorithm outperforms others approaches (e.g., degree, betweenness, and load) in accurately predicting key nodes for dynamic traffic UASNs, it suffers from high computational complexity. To address this limitation, we propose a key node prediction framework named KNP-GL, which integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract features that reflect both the structural roles of nodes and their potential impact on cascading failures, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) module to capture the temporal dynamics of cascading failures. Furthermore, based on the prediction results of KNP-GL framework, we design a mitigation strategy leveraging capacity expansion to improve network resilience against cascading failures. Experimental results show that KNP-GL framework achieves approximately 90% accuracy while reducing execution time from tens of seconds to tens of milliseconds. The proposed mitigation strategy further enhances network robustness, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for the development of high-reliability UASNs."

The capacitor bank system is located on the second floor of the Pulsed Building, while all experimental stations occupy the first floor; each floor covers approximately 2000 square meters. The 27 experimental stations are divided into four independent zones. Each zone is supplied by dedicated capacitor bank modules and features an independent grounding system. This configuration ensures that operators in unaffected zones are not exposed to hazards during high voltage or high magnetic field experiments conducted in another zone, requiring evacuation only from stations within the active zone. Consequently, this design significantly improves experimental efficiency and greatly enhances overall facility utilization."

    "abstract": "In semantic communication systems, deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has demonstrated superior performance, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios and under limited bandwidth conditions, compared to traditional communication technologies. However, most existing studies rely on communication models based on autoencoders (AE), where the distribution of transmission symbols is treated as a complete black box, causing inefficient use of limited transmission symbols. Moreover, many existing methods for image transmission focus on optimizing pixel-wise metrics, without considering the semantic information of the images. This pixel-level optimization often compromises the semantic fidelity and perceptual quality of the reconstructed images. To address these problems, we propose a novel semantic communication system that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). Specifically, a VAE is used to arbitrarily control the distribution of transmission symbols according to channel conditions, while a GAN is used to maximize the similarity of semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the perceptual quality of the reconstructed images compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are expected to play important role for future intelligent aerial systems due to their great potential to cooperatively accomplish complicated missions effectively. However, there are important challenges to be addressed to enable their efficient operation: the large-scale nature of swarms usually leads to excessive spectrum consumption, and ultra-low-cost requirements for individual UAVs renders it necessary to develop cost-effective communication modules. In addition, the densely located swarm UAVs require high resolution for localization and sensing. In order to address the above challenges and simultaneously achieve spectrum- and energy-efficient communication and accurate sensing, we investigate low-altitude UAV swarm with integrated super-resolution sensing and symbiotic communication technology. Specifically, one leading UAV may act as a primary transmitter (PT) to transmit communication signals to the base station (BS), and the remaining nearby UAVs in the swarm act as passive backscatter devices (BDs), which can modulate their information by efficiently backscattering the radio frequency (RF) signals from the PT without consuming extra spectrum or power. In addition, to achieve efficient three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution sensing for the densely located UAV swarm, 3D sparse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and super-resolution signal processing algorithms are further exploited, where both L-shaped nested array (LNA) and planar nested arrays (PNA) are considered at the BS. To evaluate the communication and sensing performance for the UAV-symbiotic radio (SR) system, the achievable rates of UAV swarm are derived and the beam patterns of sparse LNA, PNA and the benchmarking compact uniform planar array (UPA) are compared. Furthermore, efficient channel estimation methods assisted by super-resolution sensing are proposed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that 3D sparse MIMO with both LNA and PNA can provide significantly better sensing and communication performance than conventional compact MIMO for UAV-SR systems."

Firstly, a basic cascade observer is designed assuming that the structure of the system nonlinear dynamics is triangular with respect to the actual and delayed states and that the system linear dynamics is delay free. Secondly, the proposed design is extended to the case where the state delays are also involved in the linear dynamics. Such an extension is achieved by deriving a suitable cascade observer design model allowing thereby to recover the modelling requirement of the proposed basic cascade observer design. The observer convergence analysis is performed using an adequate Lyapunov approach and its performance and main properties are illustrated through probing simulation results."

There are many common threats, including phishing, malware, ransomware, and SQL injection attacks. Ensuring early detection of cyber threats is essential for securing digital systems. Traditional defence mechanisms often struggle against phishing and SQL injection attacks. But they have drawbacks as they typically rely on signature-based filters, rule-driven firewalls, and manually updated rule sets. A few of the existing solutions are Imperva Web Application Firewall and Google Safe Browsing API. In this study, we focused on two common and impactful attack types—Phishing and SQL Injection—due to their high prevalence and ability to bypass traditional defenses. A lightweight, dual-layered detection framework is employed that incorporates machine learning (ML) heuristic rules and pattern analysis to identify threats early with minimal resource requirements. We have randomly selected three ML algorithms, i.e., XGBoost, BiLSTM + Attention, and CNN+BiGRU, to identify threats related to Phishing and SQL Injection attacks. For phishing detection, we analyze URLs and HTML features, such as domain age, HTTPS usage, and anchor tags. For SQL Injection Detection, we tokenize queries and detect anomalies for deeper analysis. After extensive experiments, we found that XGBoost performs well for Phishing attacks while BiLSTM + Attention is a better fit for SQL Injection detection. The evaluation metrics are generated and presented in an interactive user interface that helps in identifying phishing and SQL Injection attacks."

However, CIM macros often face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper. When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline (conventional weight-stationary dataflow)."

    "abstract": "The recent adoption of artificial intelligence in socio-technical systems raises concerns about the black-box nature of the resulting decisions in fields such as hiring, finance, admissions, etc. If data subjects—such as job applicants, loan applicants, and students—receive an unfavorable outcome, they may be interested in algorithmic recourse, which involves updating certain features to yield a more favorable result when re-evaluated by algorithmic decision-making. Unfortunately, when individuals do not fully understand the incremental steps needed to change their circumstances, they risk following misguided paths that can lead to significant, long-term adverse consequences. Existing recourse approaches focus exclusively on the final recourse goal but neglect the possible incremental steps to reach the goal with real-life constraints, user preferences, and model artifacts. To address this gap, we formulate a visual analytic workflow for incremental recourse planning in collaboration with AI/ML experts and contribute an interactive visualization interface that helps data subjects efficiently navigate the recourse alternatives and make an informed decision. We present a usage scenario and subjective feedback from observational studies with twelve graduate students using a real-world dataset, which demonstrates that our approach can be instrumental for data subjects in choosing a suitable recourse path."

    "abstract": "Understanding how global trade works is important for shaping good economic policies and making accurate forecasts. However, many existing methods still struggle to capture the full picture, especially when it comes to subtle regional patterns or countries that do not follow typical trends. This study introduces a clustering approach designed to give a clearer view of how national economies relate to each other, using merchandise trade data from the World Trade Organization between 2013 and 2023. The method is a systematic framework built around the DBSCAN algorithm leveraging recent optimizations in density-based clustering. We extract 87 trade-related features for each country, including export and import levels, trade balance, growth trends, volatility, and economic complexity to form the input space. To find the best clustering setup, we apply a multi-metric evaluation framework incorporating the Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index as implemented in scikit-learn and we employ t-SNE alongside classical multidimensional scaling for two-dimensional visualization. The findings reveal distinct regional behaviors: Europe forms a highly connected cluster (Silhouette Score: 0.580), Asia exhibits a hub-and-spoke structure with dominant central players and several outliers (Silhouette Score: 0.411), Africa displays a heterogeneous mix of resource-based economies and emerging sub-regional linkages (Silhouette Score: 0.201), and South America and Oceania appear more fragmented with weaker overall cohesion. Overall, this framework not only highlights major trade groupings and outlier countries but also provides a structured, visual methodology for analyzing global trade networks, offering valuable insights for policy design, market strategy formulation, and risk assessment, as well as a foundation for future research in international trade analysis."

    "abstract": "Efficient arbitration is highly necessary in digital systems where multiple requesters compete for shared resources. Traditional methods such as priority-based and round-robin arbiters which are simple to implement but either suffer from starvation or lack the adaptability required to provide for fair access. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel arbitration scheme Fair Chance Round Robin (FCRR) which combines the structure of priority arbitration with a dynamic masking mechanism to ensure fair access. This is developed using Verilog HDL and tested on the Zybo-Z7 FPGA platform where FCRR addresses the shortcomings of static arbiters by integrating return-to-zero latches that temporarily blocks previously served requesters. And the comparative synthesis and simulation analysis demonstrate that FCRR achieves improved fairness with minimal hardware overhead. It achieves competitive performance, optimal logic resource utilization and reduced risk of starvation, making it a viable option for real-time systems, Network-on-Chip (NoC) designs and embedded systems."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of low accuracy and high missed detection rate in ship inspection due to the diverse types of targets and complex environments, a feature fusion ship inspection repeated classification algorithm combining PConv and SAM is proposed based on YOLOv10n. Firstly, the inverted residual structure in MobileNetV3 is utilized in combination with the SE attention mechanism for feature extraction to reduce the number of parameters and complexity of YOLOv10n feature extraction and improve the speed of feature extraction. By reusing the Neck and Detect parts of YOLOv10 for feature fusion and feature classification, and introducing PConv and SAM at the starting position of the Neck and trimming off PAN, the target detection capability is enhanced and the accuracy of feature fusion is optimized. The loss function Inner-Wise-MPDIoU is constructed to replace the loss function CIoU in YOLOv10n, improving the positioning accuracy and convergence speed. Ablation experiments and comparison experiments were conducted on the self-made dataset ZizhiShips. Compared with the two baseline algorithms and the algorithms in the recent references, the mAP, Precision, Recall, IoU and FPS on YOLOv10n increased by 2.7 %, 3.6 %, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.8 \\%, 4.4 \\%$</tex> and 7.8 M respectively.

    "abstract": "There are increasing cyber security threats for heterogeneous cloud systems and traditional security measures find it hard to protect them because their infrastructure is always evolving and complex. Because security solutions are not very clear and flexible, it becomes hard to spot attackers and address new threats as they happen. It suggests using both CNNs and LSTMs in a deep learning solution to better respond to changes in threats. Machine learning AI scores use attention mechanisms and facilitate the use of LIME explanations, allowing continuous analysis of network traffic, system logs and behavioral patterns across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. The accuracy the system showed was 97.3 % for threat detection, 94.8 % for spotting anomalies and 96.1 % in recognizing zero-day attacks, while it brought false positives down by 89.2 % compared to traditional methods. The explainability part contributed to an interpretability level of 92.7 % for security decisions. Using explainable deep learning, cybersecurity defenses perform well and allow security professionals to know and rely on the actions carried out by machines."

    "abstract": "The Free Nutritious Meal Program aims to create excellent human resources, as children who receive adequate nutrition will develop better cognitive abilities. Conversely, malnutrition can cause learning difficulties, poor memory retention, and weak concentration. Stunting significantly affects brain intelligence in children; therefore, it is crucial to minimize this problem. The central research question is how to identify and uncover the relationship between nutritional intake and the improvement of students' academic achievement through the Free Nutritious Meal Program, in order to reveal patterns and correlations in cognitive enhancement, brain development, and reasoning skills to improve student performance. The problem-solving approach employed in this study is the application of the Apriori algorithm to discover association rules, combined with clustering techniques to analyze academic improvement based on the Free Nutritious Meal Program implemented in schools. Academic performance data were compared before and after the program. The dataset consisted of students' report card scores at four educational levels elementary, junior high, senior high, and vocational school, covering odd and even semesters of the 2024/2025 academic year. The distribution of the dataset was elementary <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=136$</tex>, junior high <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=626$</tex>, senior high <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=207$</tex>, and vocational school <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=392$</tex>, for a total of 1,361 students. The results indicate a clear correlation in the improvement of students' scores before and after the Free Nutritious Meal Program. Social Studies improved from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{B}+$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{A}+$</tex> with 39% support and 80% confidence.

Mathematics <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathrm{B}+)$</tex> correlated with improvements in English and Social Studies <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathrm{A}+)$</tex> with 33% support and 80% confidence. However, there was no significant correlation in the direct improvement of Mathematics scores. Although there were improvements in Social Studies, English, and Religious Studies, numerical and formal logical aspects in Mathematics appear less influenced by the Free Nutritious Meal Program. Notably, junior high school students demonstrated the most positive response, with their average scores increasing from 90.87 before the program to 92.51 after the program. This suggests that students at the junior high school level benefited most significantly from the Free Nutritious Meal Program, can be concluded that while previous studies stated that nutritional status did not have a significant effect on academic achievement and even reported a significant negative correlation between nutrient intake and academic performance, this study shows that the Free Nutritious Meal Program improved academic achievement, particularly in social studies and English subjects, with a support value of 33 % and a confidence level of 80%. The average score increased from 82.91 to 84.97. Furthermore, testing with Spearman correlation indicated no significant relationship between nutritional status and academic achievement. However, by applying machine learning techniques, it is possible to identify correlations between nutrition and academic performance."

The variability inherent in real recordings of heart sounds and contamination with noise present serious challenges to accurate automated classification. This paper proposes WH-HeartNet, a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates discrete wavelet transform-based time-frequency feature extraction with a multi-branch ensemble of pre-trained convolutional neural networks, including ResNet50 and EfficientNet models (B1, B4, and B6). The proposed architecture effectively extracts multi-scale cardiac sound features by processing scalogram representations with different backbones, followed by feature fusion and dense classification. Trained on PhysioNet Challenge 2016 database containing 3,126 PCG recordings from different auscultation sites, WH-HeartNet yields a superior accuracy of 99.84%, precision of 99.70%, recall of 99.72%, and F1-score of 99.71%, outperforming individual baseline models significantly. These results demonstrate the robustness of the framework against noise and variability in clinical recordings, signifying its promise in real-time, non-invasive identification of cardiac abnormalities. Future efforts will revolve around integrating multi-modal physiological information and model optimization for deployment in resource-limited healthcare environments."

    "abstract": "Offline arc is a characteristic phenomenon in the dynamic interaction of the pantograph–catenary (PC) system, and its repeated occurrence leads to pronounced ablation of the contact wire surface. This significantly compromises current collection stability and shortens the service life of the PC system. Unlike previous studies that mainly focused on a single separation event, this work investigates the ablation characteristics of the contact wire under successive dynamic separations. First, a finite element–based dynamic model of the PC system was established using a three-mass model to capture the trajectories of multiple separation events between the slide and the contact wire. Then, a multi-physics coupled model of arc discharge was developed based on magnetohydrodynamic theory. Considering latent heat exchange during material phase transitions, an ablation model of the contact wire was further constructed using the apparent heat capacity method. Finally, based on a simulation platform, the effects of different separation stages and current intensities on contact wire ablation under successive dynamic separations were analyzed. The results indicate that compared with a single separation event, three successive separations increase the ablation area from 0.18 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> to 5.89 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>. Moreover, higher current intensities further aggravate ablation severity. In addition, due to cumulative arc heating effects, the third stage of successive separations becomes the dominant interval contributing to material damage of the contact wire."

This paper introduces an automated, portable oil spill detection system that uses the You Only Look Once Version 8 (YOLOv8) segmentation model (YOLOv8-seg). First, the study evaluates and compares YOLOv5, YOLOv8-seg, U-Net, and Mask RCNN on the dataset from RobOflow. We look at the trade-offs between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Mask R-CNN and U-Net provide higher boundary precision but have slow inference speeds, which restrict their use in real-time situations. In contrast, YOLOv8-seg is 79% faster than U-Net and 91.6% faster than Mask R-CNN, achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for edge computing applications. The model is deployed on the low power Grove Vision AI module, which demonstrates real-time, on-site oil spill detection capabilities. This setup enables immediate data processing, enabling quicker environmental responses and supporting ecological monitoring efforts. The findings suggest that YOLOv8-seg offers an effective balance between precision and efficiency, making it a practical solution for automated marine oil spill monitoring in resource-limited, field-ready contexts."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for timing accuracy in electronic systems, jitter control has emerged as a critical challenge in high-speed digital communications. To effectively suppress jitter, decomposition methods based on equivalent- time sampling oscilloscopes are employed to identify its sources. However, jitter decomposition often requires extensive sampling points, leading to prolonged measurement times that fail to meet the stringent real-time requirements of online testing and adaptive clock recovery. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-stage jitter decomposition algorithm based on dual-Dirac model, which decomposes deterministic jitter and random jitter. The proposed method employs a two- stage decomposition process: (1) an initial coarse estimation using maximum a posteriori-based gradient descent, followed by (2) Markov chain Monte Carlo-based parameter refinement. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, with Kullback-Leibler divergence reduced to 0.0356 at 64 sampling point, provides a 17.21º/o improvement in accuracy compared to Gaussian mixture model and a 63.19º/o enhancement over kernel density estimation, while the relative bias of parameter significantly outperforming baseline schemes across different number of samples."

GAN-based medical image inpainting aims to recover anatomical structures and tissue textures in occluded regions.

Major challenges include adaptive modeling of complex occlusions, effective utilization of multi-scale contextual information, and ensuring semantic validity of generated content. Mainstream approaches employ attention mechanisms, multi-stage generation strategies, crossmodal guidance, and edge-aware constraints to address issues such as local-to-global feature alignment and sharpening blurred occlusion boundaries. Although existing techniques perform well in restoring regular occlusions, deficiencies remain in dynamic occlusion modeling, blurred edge recovery, and robust cross-domain generalization capabilities, which constitute key directions for future improvement."

    "abstract": "Global forest decline is been observed across different ecosystems. Time series of Earth Observation images are very useful to detect and locate sudden drops of vegetation greenness. However, the increasing frequency of disturbances linked to global change (drought, pests, etc.) can lead to a scattered response by each individual tree. Hence, evidence of tree decay becomes harder to show due to constraint posed by sensors spatial resolution. In this work, we leverage images collected by the Venus VM5 satellite mission during more than 2 years over Doñana National Park. In situ observations have reported during 2022 a significant dieback of old tall trees which has been more dramatic for remnant Cork Oaks. Most of these trees are found isolated or small patches with a maximum crown area below the spatial resolution of available optical time series of Earth Observation images. In this work we test the enhancement of spatial and temporal resolution provided by Venus VM5 to detect and locate trees or stands undergoing canopy decline leading to subsequent dieback. We compared different vegetation indices and applied time series analysis to detect declining trends and assessed accuracy according to tree species and canopy size. Additionally, aerial images provided by Google and Bing were used for validation. Overall, NDVI and EVI enabled to identify most of the affected individuals being limited by small canopy sizes. Among the different methods, monotonic and median trends yielded accurate estimates of total affected area. The method developed is intended to be applied with Sentinel-2 images in order to evaluate the limitations of spatial resolution, after decommissioning of Venus VM5 satellite."

We propose an optimization-based energy management framework to address supply interruptions in NMGs, particularly during grid failures and loss of inter-microgrid connectivity caused by natural disasters (NDs). The model evaluates system performance by measuring unserved energy under varying fault scenarios. Results highlight that while NMGs manage grid outages with 31.7 kWh of unserved load, full inter-MG disconnection results in a sharp increase to 366.3 kWh, emphasizing the critical role of microgrid interconnection in ensuring operational resilience."

    "abstract": "Annotation is often a time-consuming but fruitful activity in data analysis contexts. The manual labor required to create useful annotations is a barrier that keeps users from documenting their analysis, especially intermediate results. To address the needs of exploration and annotation alike, we propose integrating annotation with lens-based interactions, combining both with guidance. We investigate the exploration-annotation requirement space, identifying challenges and extracting five design requirements for annotation in exploration contexts. Based on this investigation, we designed ANNOLENS—a concrete instantiation of such a system that lets users explore and annotate dimensionality-reduced multivariate data. It employs a dual-lens approach for contrastive exploration, using guidance to steer users toward interesting data subsets and attributes. Annotation is directly integrated into the lenses, letting users quickly annotate hunches and discoveries. Automated merging and linking serve to simplify annotation management and reduce disruptions.

    "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) scattering from an infinitely long cylinder of arbitrary cross-section in which an aperture has been opened is studied. The surface of the cylinder is of finite conductivity so that it is appropriate to enforce the Leontovich boundary condition on the surface. The incident magnetic field is parallel to the cylinder axis, so all fields are transverse electric (TE) to this axis. An integral equation (IE) with a hypersingular kernel is obtained for the surface current. The IE is ill-conditioned and must be regularized to obtain reliable numerical solutions. The process of analytical regularization employing the Abel integral transform method is described. Numerically computed scattered fields and their dependence on the impedance will be examined."

    "abstract": "To overcome the slow convergence and inadequate global search capabilities of traditional algorithms in high-dimensional nonlinear multi-objective power system optimization, this study develops a hybrid SA-PSO algorithm merging simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization. The innovation lies in synergizing SA's global perturbation with PSO's swarm intelligence through three mechanisms: integrating SA's Metropolis criterion to dynamically accept suboptimal solutions during PSO iterations, employing an exponential cooling strategy with a 0.95 temperature decay coefficient for adaptive search control, and designing a dual iterative process that alternates between SA-driven perturbation and PSO-based swarm updates. Experimental results reveal a threefold expansion in solution search range alongside 0.5% convergence error and 46% efficiency gains compared to conventional methods. In practical grid operations, the algorithm achieves 12% higher energy storage efficiency, maintains transmission coordination deviations within ± 0.8%, and reduces thermal power adjustment time. Economically, it lowers generation costs by 15.8% while environmentally cutting carbon emissions by 23.4%. By mitigating premature convergence in high-dimensional spaces and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, the approach demonstrates superior capability in coordinating cost-effectiveness, operational flexibility, and sustainability objectives, offering a systematic framework for complex power system optimization challenges."

As the number of flows in a network grows, SDN controllers struggle with increasing memory usage and slower rule processing. To address this, we present an optimization technique that applies Huffman coding to flow table management. The idea is simple: by using frequency-based encoding for commonly repeated match fields and actions, we can compress flow entries, reduce storage requirements, and speed up rule lookups. We tested this approach using Mininet and the Ryu controller, and the results show clear benefits lower memory consumption, faster rule retrieval, and improved network throughput compared to traditional methods. These findings suggest that Huffman coding provides a lightweight and effective way to enhance the scalability and performance of SDN controllers, making it a promising solution for future network architectures."

    "abstract": "In the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX), we observe signatures of magnetic field aligned elongated density structures in capacitively coupled plasmas. These elongated filamentary structures appear in the low density, low temperature plasmas at high magnetic fields, under conditions where the electron and ion gyro-radii are smaller than their respective neutral collision mean free paths. Perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, these filamentary structures can have different shapes such as circular and multiarm spirals (resembling azimuthal modes). Fast imaging reveals various complex spatiotemporal dynamics such as translation and rotation of individual filaments, transformation between the various azimuthal modes/morphologies, formation and destruction of filaments due to interactions with background plasma turbulence, and emergence of the individual filaments from azimuthally elongated zonal flow like structures. Novel radial confinement schemes allow us to isolate and investigate some of these spatiotemporal dynamics in more detail. This presentation will give an overview of recent experimental efforts to understand the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of these filaments, as well as the use of charged dust grains to probe the 3-D structures and the electrostatic properties of these magnetic field aligned elongated filamentary density structures."

SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) is an integrated circuit technology that converts parallel data into high-speed serial data (transmitter) and restores serial data into parallel data (receiver), used to solve timing, noise, and distance issues in high-speed data transmission. Noise cannot be completely eliminated, and interference sources include circuit design, layout and wiring, as well as electron and hole characteristics. As the signal frequency increases, the impact of noise becomes greater, and the need to minimize noise becomes stronger. Based on practical project experience, this article introduces the noise simulation and testing of SerDes interface from the perspective of power supply noise simulation and testing principles. The noise simulation error of digital power supply and analog power supply is less than 3mV, achieving high-precision noise simulation consistency alignment."

    "abstract": "The block-based inference engine, powered by noncontiguous key-value (KV) cache management, has emerged as a new paradigm for large language model (LLM) inference due to its efficient memory utilization. However, in large-batch, longcontext workloads, the substantial demand for KV cache remains a major bottleneck in inference performance. Existing research leverages the sparsity of the attention mechanisms by removing non-critical tokens to limit the KV cache size. However, we observe that in block-based inference engines, current sparse methods require defragmentation after token removal to maintain tensor continuity, incurring significant overhead. Additionally, we find a correlation between request length and sparsity potential, yet existing methods apply a uniform sparsity strategy at batch level without dynamic adjustment. To address these, we propose DualSpar, a novel sparse KV cache framework with dual-granularity memory and adaptive sparsity strategy. First, it binds token importance to KV cache block granularity, achieving low-overhead pre-consolidation. Second, it incorporates system load and request length into sparsity decision, fully exploiting the sparse potential of different requests while reducing the queuing latency in large-batch processing. Evaluations show that DualSpar achieves up to a 3.16× throughput improvement, a 3.75× faster time-to-first-token (TTFT), and an 87.2% reduction in defragmentation overhead while maintaining high accuracy."

The TC-MP solution using Base A served as the ground-truth trajectory. Across all methods, LC and TC-SP significantly improved horizontal accuracy compared with GNSS-only solutions, achieving sub-decimeter performance when a nearby base was available. Over longer baselines, TC-SP maintained centimeter-to-decimeter accuracy, while TC-MP achieved centimeter-level precision after batch processing. The results confirm TC-SP and TC-MP as robust, high-accuracy solutions for vehicle navigation."

The optimization objective is to minimize the cumulative quadratic deviation of grid exchange with respect to the daily net energy demand, thereby promoting load balancing and reducing grid stress. The proposed method provides a flexible and effective alternative to Rule Based solutions, showing substantial improvements. Valuable insights are also provided through a comparison with a Dynamic Programming solution used as benchmark.

    "abstract": "Satellite image data has many advantages for mapping and assessing land cover changes, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. However, remote sensing image data often contains noise and outliers. Traditional clustering algorithms often encounter challenges in processing this data. This paper proposes an enhanced semisupervised Gaussian fuzzy c-Means clustering algorithm for remote sensing image analysis (ESS-GFCM). The proposed algorithm integrates Gaussian membership functions with semi-supervised learning constraints and a boosting mechanism to improve land cover classification performance from remote sensing imagery. The proposed method can use some labeled or known data to aid the clustering process, incorporate Gaussian kernel weights to better model class distributions, and apply boosting updates to stabilize convergence. Experiments performed on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 datasets demonstrate that ESS-GFCM outperforms FCM, Gaussian FCM, and Semi-supervised FCM algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational speed."

    "abstract": "The increasing volatility of electricity markets, driven by the growing integration of renewable energy, poses challenges for energy consumers seeking cost-effective energy management strategies. To minimize energy procurement costs in the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL), this study proposes an integrated framework combining long-term price forecasting and battery degradation-aware optimization. Based on historical market data from 2019 to 2024, a linear regression model forecasts hourly prices up to 2030, incorporating projected growth in solar and wind capacities. The optimization model evaluates the operational strategies for two lithium-ion battery chemistry types: Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO) and Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC). It incorporates degradation costs directly into its objective function during operational planning, dynamically accounting for the effects of cycling. The degradation impact is incorporated using semi-empirical models capturing both calendar and cycling ageing mechanisms. Results demonstrate that including degradation in the optimization process significantly alters operational patterns, leading to lower energy costs and extended battery lifetime. Additionally, a comparative analysis highlights the superior performance of NMC batteries under projected market conditions. This framework provides valuable insights into energy storage planning in evolving electricity markets and lays the groundwork for future advancements in degradation-aware optimization strategies."

In this work, we present a novel constraint-guided exploration of the Feasible Operating Region (FOR), aimed at efficiently identifying and sampling regions where system constraints become active. To generate corresponding load profiles, we employ an OPF-based disaggregation method that ensures physical and operational feasibility. We validate the proposed approach on SimBench benchmark grids, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing active constraint regions when compared to random sampling methods."

    "abstract": "The design of large reflectarray antennas usually demands a high computational cost for the accurate analysis of the printed elements on the reflectarray surface. The use of approximations to reduce the computational workload impacts on the design accuracy by introducing errors in the phase of the reflected field that can result in increased side lobe levels and loss of gain. In contrast, surrogate modelling of the reflection coefficients of the reflectarray cell might provide sufficient accuracy without significantly reducing the design accuracy. The high gain antennas embarked on satellites require large antenna apertures, accurate beam shaping and optimal aperture efficiency, which prevents the use of general design approaches to reduce the computational cost. In this work, a single-layer multi-purpose reflectarray cell is characterized using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to speed up the electromagnetic analysis of large reflectarray antennas with dual-band and dual-polarization operation, without compromising accuracy."

Fifth overtone quality factor is a critical parameter for asymmetric ring electrode quartz crystal piezoelectric sensors operating in the fifth overtone mode because it closely associated with dynamic variations and stability during detection processes. Considering that the nominal fundamental resonance frequency is different from the actual fundamental resonance frequency. Similarly, the nominal fifth overtone resonance frequency is also different from the actual fifth overtone resonance frequency. Therefore, it is essential to distinguish between the actual fifth overtone quality factor and the nominal fifth overtone quality factor (Q’<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</inf>).

Furthermore, we calculated the fundamental frequency mass sensitivity and fifth overtone mass sensitivity of these sensors. The results revealed that the fifth overtone mass sensitivity is fivefold greater than its fundamental frequency mass sensitivity, indicating that operating quartz crystal piezoelectric sensors with asymmetric ring electrodes in the fifth overtone mode significantly enhances their mass sensitivity. This research will not only inspire novel applications of quartz crystal piezoelectric sensors with asymmetric ring electrode in the fifth overtone mode but also advance their utilization in sensing and detection technologies."

A high-voltage current is applied to an aluminum wire submerged in water, causing it to explode under the influence of a strong electric field and release energy instantaneously, thereby exciting a shock wave and triggering a bubble pulse. To obtain pressure wave characteristics at different propagation distances, two piezoelectric pressure sensors of different models are deployed at positions 46 cm, 56 cm and 86 cm from the explosion center for independent measurements. A high-speed camera with the powerful light source is used to record the image sequences of bubble evolution. Experimental results show that the shock wave at various distances exhibits typical characteristics of rapid rise and decay. The peak pressure decreases significantly as the propagation distance increases. Bubble pulses display a low-amplitude, long-duration sinusoidal structure. Waveforms measured by the two sensors at the same locations are highly consistent, showing similar peak decay trends and indicating that the measurement system has good stability and repeatability. This study provides data support for understanding the propagation behavior of underwater electrical explosion pressure waves."

Tourist mobility patterns, in particular, offer valuable insights into the spatial and social dynamics that influence system design decisions for smart cities, recommendation engines, and urban planning applications. This work presents a comprehensive approach to modeling urban mobility networks by examining tourist behavior through network analysis techniques. Using Rome as a case study, we leverage a large dataset of Foursquare check-ins collected over 18 months to construct a co-visitation graph where nodes represent points of interest and edges reflect shared visits by the same users. Through network analysis of Rome’s tourist mobility, our work identifies clear structural differences between visitor types: long-term visitors form cohesive, highly clustered mobility networks, while short-term visitors create more fragmented interaction patterns. Key points of interest (especially transportation hubs and cultural landmarks) serve as essential connectors shaping network flow, following preferential attachment dynamics. Mobility-aware systems play a crucial role in leveraging such insights to design adaptive, data-driven services that respond to varying mobility behaviors, ultimately enhancing urban efficiency and user experience."

Traditional computational methods, such as sentiment analysis, are often insufficient as they fail to capture the nuanced narrative angles that define media frames. This paper introduces a novel, zero-shot framework for the automated classification of news headlines into predefined media frames using a large language model (LLM). A codebook of four primary frames—Economic Consequences, Human Interest, Conflict, and Ethical & Moral—is established, and a structured prompt is engineered to guide the LLM's inferential process. The framework is validated through a proof-of-concept, applied to a curated set of headlines concerning the topic of Electric Vehicles (EVs), which demonstrates the model's capacity to consistently identify the dominant narrative frame and provide a coherent justification for its classification. This work represents a step towards the development of more sophisticated, scalable, and accessible tools for computational media analysis, enabling researchers to move beyond simple sentiment and explore the deeper structures of media discourse."

This study sought to establish a unified model that encompasses noise suppression and tumor recognition across four distinct categories, namely glioma, meningioma, pituitary and nontumor. In this study, a public Kaggle dataset (comprising 7,023 slices) was utilised, with the standardisation of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$256 \\times 256$</tex> inputs and the training of a Denoising-and-Classification Autoencoder (DCAE) being the primary focus. The architecture of the DCAE comprised a convolutional encoder-decoder with CBAM attention on the encoder, symmetric skip connections to preserve high-frequency structure, and a lightweight MLP branching from the 512-dimensional bottleneck for classification. The training process incorporated synthetic Gaussian noise injection, in conjunction with a joint objective and label-smoothed cross-entropy (weights <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$a_{1}=1.0, a_{2}=0.55$</tex>).

In the test set, the attention-only variant demonstrated the optimal diagnostic performance (Accuracy 98.25 %, Macro-F1 98.20 %), exhibiting an enhancement of approximately 0.85 percentage points over the baseline.

The field measurements were taken from various types of voltage reduction technologies and scenarios including the decrement of the tap position on distribution transformers. The load modelling analysis is carried out for three representative 33kV/11kV substations where a correlation is found between the amount of demand reduction and the results of the static exponential load model.

    "abstract": "Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are the common benign tumor of the female reproductive system. With uterine fibroid diagnosis, there can be many manifestations may be associated like heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, or pressure, infertility, or even malignant transformation, therefore making it a diagnosis worth reviewing due to its clinical significance. It is important to get an early and correct diagnosis of uterine fibroids, as it will directly affect the management of the condition and potential overall improvement in the patient's outcomes. In this study, here present a reproducible hybrid pipeline that integrates deep learning and radiomics for the automatic detection of uterine fibroids in MRI. The hybrid framework includes a U-Net based segmentation module to locate uterine fibroids, a ResNet-18 based region of interest (ROI) classifier to predict benign vs malignant, and PyRadiomics to extract handcrafted radiomics features. A LightGBM meta-learner was employed to perform feature-level stacking with the deep learning CNN embeddings and radiomics descriptor features. Tested the framework on datasets with uterine myoma data (Uterine Myoma Dataset (UMD)) and TCGA-UCEC. Shown that the hybrid framework achieves better performance than the single-paradigm models with U-Net Dice scores of 0.91 for segmentation and prediction accuracy of 95.1% and AUC of 0.97. In the framework, compared our hybrid setup against CNN-only, radiomic-only, and transformer-based approaches, to show the advantages of stacking. The pipeline was designed using PyTorch, and made the study reproducible by providing open-source scripts available on GitHub, to encourage future research efforts around gynecological AI. The framework has promise in the clinical environment as a supportive decision tool for radiologists and gynecologists that can assist in the early diagnosis of uterine myomas and help in treatment selection."

Subsequently, a synchronous modulation power source capable of offsetting the primary load current was successfully developed, utilizing synchronous modulation and self-current-sharing techniques. Test results show that the proposed power source can adapt to field conditions with high harmonic content and rapid changes in load current."

Unlike approaches that require binary disassembly or CFG extraction, our method constructs graphs efficiently via feature similarity, enabling scalable deployment.

These results outperform single-architecture baselines and recent methods while preserving practical applicability. Our contributions are: (i) an efficient graph construction pipeline from tabular memory dumps, (ii) a sequential GGNN→GCN hybrid that leverages complementary inductive biases, and (iii) thorough empirical validation with ablations, comparisons, and diagnostic visualizations. Limitations (scalability, dataset bias, and adversarial robustness) are discussed together with avenues for future work."

Most heritage buildings rely on traditional on/off HVAC controllers with fixed temperature setpoints that fail to account for relative humidity variations and occupancy levels. This study develops and evaluates two intelligent HVAC system controllers based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy inference systems (FIS), which regulate indoor air temperature and relative humidity while accounting for building occupancy patterns. Using real-world datasets taken from a UNESCO World Heritage site in San Antonio, Texas, USA, results indicate that smart controllers, particularly FIS model, enhance building performance by improving thermal comfort and indoor environmental conditions for building and artwork conservation while reducing HVAC operation time by up to 30% compared to conventional on/off controllers. The study highlights the advantages of smart controllers in enhancing both energy efficiency and preservation efforts in historic buildings while maintaining optimal thermal comfort."

    "abstract": "As modern AI workloads increasingly rely on heterogeneous accelerators, ensuring high-bandwidth and layout-flexible data movements between accelerator memories has become a pressing challenge. Direct Memory Access (DMA) engines promise high bandwidth utilization for data movements but are typically optimal only for contiguous memory access, thus requiring additional software loops for data layout transformations. This, in turn, leads to excessive control overhead and underutilized on-chip interconnects. To overcome this inefficiency, we present XDMA, a distributed and extensible DMA architecture that enables layout-flexible data movements with high link utilization. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a data streaming engine as XDMA Frontend, replacing software address generators with hardware ones; (2) a distributed DMA architecture that maximizes link utilization and separates configuration from data transfer; (3) flexible plugins for XDMA enabling on-the-fly data manipulation during data transfers. XDMA demonstrates up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$151.2 \\times / 8.2 \\times$</tex> higher link utilization than software-based implementations in synthetic workloads and achieves <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.3 \\times$</tex> average speedup over accelerators with SoTA DMA in real-world applications.

Initially, the TLS-ESPRIT algorithm was employed to extract the principal modes of SSO. Subsequently, a damping ratio regression model was established using the principal component analysis (PCA)-random forest (RF) algorithm. The regression model was assessed to identify the dominant factors influencing SSO in wind farms. Thereafter, the SSDC was integrated into the static var generator (SVG) and optimized via a genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, a double-fed wind farm simulation model was implemented in PSCAD. The results demonstrate that the damping ratio regression model effectively identifies the dominant factors influencing SSO. The optimized sub-synchronous damping controller effectively resolves the issue of traditional SSDCs failing to provide positive damping under varying operating conditions and exhibits rapid suppression capabilities."

These methods are based on the study of the eigenvalues of the minor loop that represents the product of the grid impedance and the IBR admittance, both measured at the connection point. However, the link between the shape of the eigenvalues and the admittance terms that cause instability is not straightforward to determine. As a consequence, redesigning control loops to improve stability margins is a challenging task. In this paper, a methodology to determine the influence of IBR controllers on the stability margins is proposed. This methodology is based on analytical derivations that help understand how the minor loop eigenvalues are affected by the different terms of the impedance/admittance. Then, a compensation loop is designed to stabilise the system. The proposal has been validated by using numerical simulations performed in MATLAB/Simulink of an IBR connected to a weak power grid."

    "abstract": "As residential rooftop photovoltaic (PV) adoption increases, more local solar output becomes hidden behind-the-meter (BTM). Moreover, the stochastic and volatile nature of PV generation, combined with its invisibility, increases the variability and unpredictability of overall energy demand. Disaggregating BTM PV generation from actual net load is essential for reliable distribution grids operation. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware dynamic graph variational framework that disaggregates BTM PV generation and load using only smart-meter net load measurements. Using a dynamic graph, we represent 100 PV-equipped Dutch households as nodes, where edges encode correlations among their net demand time series. The Graph Attention Recurrent Neural Network encoder processes this graph with graph convolutions, self-attention, and recurrent layers to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics. A multi-quantile gated recurrent unit decoder then infers each home’s separate solar and load time series, outputting probabilistic estimates that quantify uncertainty in each output. Designed for real-time inference, it enables online distribution network level monitoring. We validate the method on real data demonstrating accurate disaggregation and reliable uncertainty quantification."

This paper simulates real-world cyber-attack scenarios that target wind turbine stability by manipulating pitch angle and yaw control systems operated through Programmable Logic Controllers. Four different cyber attacks are executed as part of penetration testing exercises against wind turbines, three of which are developed using the pyModbusTCP library, while the last is leveraged using the mbtget tool. Furthermore, the detection capabilities of three widely adopted network-based intrusion detection system (IDS) solutions are evaluated. Then, we propose IDS signatures to enhance the detection capabilities of IDS solutions against these specific cyber attacks that alter wind speed data, potentially manipulating the pitch angle and causing physical impacts on the power system. Moreover, case studies assess the physical impact of cyber-attacks on wind turbine stability and power system performance. The findings revealed that signature-based IDS solutions are insufficient for detecting the modeled attacks, which could result in physical instability in wind turbines. Therefore, refined signatures should be developed and deployed in modern IDS solutions to enhance the resilience of infrastructures like wind farms."

    "abstract": "Many environmental applications, such as hydrological and agricultural studies, require high spatial resolution and accurate precipitation data. In many places, ground observations of precipitation are unavailable. Therefore, data on precipitation are often obtained from satellite remote sensing. Unfortunately, precipitation estimates from remote sensing products are often too coarse in space and require further downscaling to match the required spatial resolution. We developed the Landcover similarity and Distance Weighted Regression with Residual correction model (LDWRR) that incorporates a vegetation index based on an adaptive lag phase and topography, and also includes a residual correction procedure that is combined with ground observations. The performance of the model is assessed by downscaling precipitation data obtained from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) from 10 km to 1 km spatial resolution over the Pearl River Basin in Southern China from 2010 to 2019 at daily resolution. Validation of the downscaled precipitation is done using ground observations. The LDWRR model is able to reproduce the precipitation pattern at high resolution, and it provides improved precipitation accuracy compared with the original coarse precipitation data. The correlation coefficients of the precipitation downscaled using LDWRR are larger than 0.7 at daily resolution. Moreover, the accuracy improved by more than 4% on average compared with IMERG. The LDWRR model is general and can be used in other regions and on any remote sensing device to spatially downscale precipitation data."

    "abstract": "In this work, a dynamic event-triggered optimized backstepping control approach based on neural networks is proposed to address communication limitations in strict-feedback nonlinear systems. Neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown system uncertainties, with their parameters updated via a gradient descent algorithm. To enhance the communication efficiency of both control inputs and neural network parameters, a dynamic event-triggering scheme is devised. This mechanism adaptively modifies its threshold parameters in real time, depending on the system’s tracking performance. Additionally, a disturbance observer is incorporated to mitigate the influence of external perturbations. By formulating a barrier-type performance index for subsystem optimization and integrating observer–actor–critic structures, both virtual and actual optimal controllers are derived within an inversion-based control framework. Lyapunov theory is utilized to demonstrate that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the control strategy are verified by numerical simulations and an application case of an electromechanical system."

    "abstract": "Edge prediction (EP) is a long-standing and fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis, and has served as a key driver in the advancement of graph learning. Traditional EP methods can be broadly classified into three major categories: heuristic approaches, embedding-based methods, and graph neural network (GNN)-based techniques. While each category has achieved notable performance improvements, these methods often fall short in handling uncertainty and generally lack robust interpretability. These limitations highlight an urgent need for novel approaches that can effectively address uncertain EP tasks while offering strong interpretability and rich feature representations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel graph fuzzy system (GFS) for edge prediction, termed GFS-edge, and systematically introduces its core concepts, model architecture, and construction methodology. Specifically, we first define key concepts of GFS-edge, including rule bases, fuzzy sets, and edge consequent processing module (ECPM). We then present a general modeling framework for GFS-edge, detailing the formulation of rule antecedents and consequents. Subsequently, a learning framework is introduced, in which edge-based clustering is employed for antecedent generation, while a linear variational graph auto-encoder (LVGAE) is adopted as the ECPM to facilitate consequent learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of GFS-edge. The results consistently demonstrate that GFS-edge outperforms existing methods from all three traditional EP categories, showcasing superior performance while effectively addressing uncertainty modeling and interpretability challenges."

    "abstract": "Industrial few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) requires identifying various abnormal states by leveraging as few normal samples as possible (abnormal samples are unavailable during training). However, current methods often require training a separate model for each category, leading to increased computation and storage overhead. Thus, designing a unified anomaly detection model that supports multiple categories remains a challenging task, as such a model must recognize anomalous patterns across diverse objects and domains. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces FocusPatch AD, a unified anomaly detection framework based on vision-language models, achieving anomaly detection under few-shot multi-class settings. FocusPatch AD links anomaly state keywords to highly relevant discrete local regions within the image, guiding the model to focus on cross-category anomalies while filtering out background interference. This approach mitigates the false detection issues caused by global semantic alignment in vision-language models. We evaluate the proposed method on the MVTec, VisA, and Real-IAD datasets, comparing them against several prevailing anomaly detection methods. In both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection tasks, FocusPatch AD achieves significant gains in classification and localization performance, demonstrating excellent generalization and adaptability."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of three-dimensional (3D) power tower point clouds is a key technology for smart grid inspection and digital modeling of transmission corridors. However, slender structures such as power lines are sparse and discontinuous, and susceptible to occlusion in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, resulting in insufficient segmentation precision for existing methods. To address this issue, a novel 3D power tower semantic segmentation method, superpoint transmamba (SPTM), is proposed. Firstly, a sparse 3D U-Net is used as the backbone network, and a superpoint pooling layer is used to aggregate features in locally geometrically consistent regions. Then, a hybrid query decoder that fuses the Transformer and the Mamba state-space model is introduced in the decoding stage to balance local geometric details with the modeling of global long-range dependencies. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on a dataset of power tower point clouds collected by UAVs to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments demonstrate that SPTM outperforms existing mainstream methods (such as Point Transformer, Stratified Transformer, and 3DSwin Transformer) in metrics such as mean intersection over union (mIoU) and mean accuracy (mAcc), achieving significant improvements in power line classification. Ablation experiments further validate the complementarity and effectiveness of superpoint pooling and the Mamba module in identifying slender structures. This method provides an efficient and accurate solution for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation in complex power transmission scenarios."

    "abstract": "As mobile networks evolve beyond 5G, the convergence of cloud, edge and network domains renders siloed orchestration unsustainable. Achieving the adaptability and autonomy required by 6G requires an intelligence layer capable of reasoning, coordination, and continuous learning across distributed systems. While Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced cognitive automation, the next step is Agentic AI, where autonomous agents reason, negotiate and act collaboratively. This article introduces two key contributions: 1) a blueprint for Domain Agentic Systems (DASs), i.e., composite, scope-bounded subsystems that combine multiple agents, service engines and a communication bus to deliver specific orchestration functionalities, and 2) the AGILE-6G framework, a next-generation orchestration paradigm that embeds an agentic intelligence layer above traditional management systems. AGILE-6G organizes DASs across end-to- end (global) and specialized domains (e.g., Radio Access Network), enabling context-aware decision-making, self-healing and adaptive service management through agent collaboration. Two representative use cases illustrate how AGILE-6G achieves automatic reconfiguration of network and application services, highlighting its potential to realize scalable and trustworthy orchestration in 6G systems."

    "abstract": "Effective fault diagnosis for industrial robots is critical to ensure their operational availability and reliability in safety-critical applications. Proprioceptive signals from robot servo drive systems provide a nonintrusive and promising solution for practical in situ diagnosis. While their exhibited significant multisensor heterogeneity and nonstationarity caused by time-varying operating conditions challenge existing diagnostic methods in identifying fault-induced intrinsic signatures. Concurrently, inadequate prior knowledge integration limits data-driven approaches in physical consistency, leading to outputs that may not adhere to fundamental physical principles, such as the laws of motion derived from Lagrangian mechanics. Thereupon, a hybrid attention Lagrangian variational autoencoder with latent representation disentanglement is proposed for industrial robot diagnosis under time-varying conditions using multivariate proprioceptive signals. Specifically, a hybrid attention-based encoder is devised for composite modeling of interseries association patterns and intraseries temporal variations, encoding multimodal spatiotemporal complementary information into condition-independent latent spaces. A Lagrangian mechanics-embedded decoder with structured network topology ensures latent spaces with critical information reservation and nonstationary disturbance isolation by physics-constrained state reconstruction. Concurrently, the dual-regularized latent disentanglement strategy separates fault-specific latent space from fault-invariant contexts through the variational evidence lower bound-driven posterior alignment and the explicit supervision from adversarial and diagnostic classifiers. Hereinto, the Gaussian mixture prior is imposed on the fault-specific latent space to promote interclass separability and intraclass compactness. The developed physics-embedded framework effectively decouples intrinsic fault patterns from nonstationary inference. Comprehensive case studies using both simulated and real-world industrial robot datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

In low-data settings, prompting advanced LLMs such as ChatGPT proves more effective. We also identify challenges related to input length and unidirectional context during fine-tuning, and propose two remedial strategies: a sliding window approach and right-forward embedding, both of which yield significant improvements. Moreover, we provide the first assessment of LLM generalizability in AVL, showing that certain models can transfer effectively across Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and projects. However, performance degrades notably for newly discovered vulnerabilities containing unfamiliar lexical or structural patterns, underscoring the need for continual adaptation. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying LLM-based AVL systems in realistic software security workflows.</p>"

    "abstract": "Hand motion capture devices are widely used in sign language translation, virtual reality (VR) motion reconstruction, and human–computer interaction. However, current devices often suffer from limited hand information collection due to the use of single sensor types, large sizes, and unreasonable layouts. To address these issues, we propose a smart glove based on the fusion of optical fibers and inertial sensors, which consists of nine polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flexible optical fiber sensors and an inertial sensor. The flexible optical fiber sensors detect finger joint bending, while the inertial sensor captures spatial hand information. The system employs a multimodal fusion algorithm to enable both gesture recognition and human–computer interaction. Dynamic gestures of the 26 English letters and common English words consisting of two to five letters can be recognized using long short-term memory (LSTM) or bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models combined with an attention mechanism. The gesture prediction accuracy for the 26 English letters and common English words reaches 99.76% and 97.66%, respectively. Additionally, the glove system wirelessly transmits data to a computer via the ESP32S3 chip’s Wi-Fi module, where UE4 software uses C++ programming to achieve VR motion restoration. By encoding the glove data in Python and transmitting it to a robotic hand, real-time control of the robotic hand can be achieved."

Starting from the influence of spoofing signals on the tracking loops of navigation terminals, analyzing their effect on loop states is an effective approach to fundamentally analyze the abnormal working states of receivers caused by spoofing signal intrusion. This paper constructs a model of the code phase pulling process of spoofing signals, divides the code phase pulling process into three stages according to the distortion characteristics of the Cross-Correlation Function (CCF), derives the state-space model of the code loop filter using forward Euler discretization, obtains the recursive relationship between phase discrimination error and local code phase adjustment, and analyzes the code phase pulling process of spoofing signals based on an open-source GNSS receiver. The results show that the transient responses in the CCF separation stage directly determine the success or failure of spoofing attacks."

This is made possible by the collection of time-stamped data building on synchronized sensor clocks. Some applications benefit from a temporary deployment of the network. This is for instance the case for the instrumentation of an aircraft during flight tests using connected microphones and accelerometers. In this case, the clock synchronization protocol must converge fast and in a bounded time. In this paper, we propose TAYLORS, a distributed and thus robust synchronization protocol for WSN that offers a fast bounded convergence and that keeps a stable clock even in dynamic settings. TAYLORS combines both max-consensus at initialization and average-consensus over the long term. This work provides as well a novel mathematical model to derive a worst-case bound on convergence of low memory average-consensus protocols, that is leveraged to motivate the design of TAYLORS. Experimental results show that the proposed solution is simple, fast and suitable for very basic microcontrollers."

The conventional selection methods, which are highly reliant on humans’ assessments, are time consuming, subjective and have a high likelihood of biasness. This research introduces the Hybrid Deep Learning Framework (HDLF) that will help select scholarship beneficiaries more accurately and without any bias, thus overcoming the drawbacks of the manual and bias selection processes. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to screen the contents of applications, Gradient Boosting to predict performance and attention-based neural networks and adaptive weighting of features to provide a dynamic adaptability to eligibility criteria. On a real-world test-set of 10,000 applications the model produced 92.8 percent accuracy, 91.6 percent precision, 90.9 percent recall, 91.2 percent F1-score and 93.5 percent ROC-AUC; outperforming both Logistic Regression (76.5 percent) and Random Forest (89.3 percent) by more than 15 percent in accuracy. Explainability of AI (XAI) prevents blackbox decision making by using feature attributions to explain decisions. The suggested solution is scalable, unbiased, and interpretable, being an efficient approach to allocating scholarship efficiently and having a chance to be implemented in a global arena."

During the third round of the 2026 World Cup Qualifiers, their official Instagram account received thousands of public comments, expressing diverse sentiments. This study aims to analyze these Instagram comments using the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) approach. A total of 6.600 comments were collected via web scraping from six match-related posts with 6.216 comments remaining after preprocessing. Aspect extraction was performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), yielding three main aspects: “Dukungan & Semangat Nasional,” “Performa Tim & Lawan,” and “Hasil & Situasi Pertandingan:” These aspects were subsequently validated by linguists. Sentiment labeling was conducted using the InSet lexicon. Comments were then vectorized using TF-IDF and classified with the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which was optimized using GridSearchCV and validated through Stratified K-Fold cross-validation. The classification results showed the highest accuracy for the “Performa Tim & Lawan” aspect (81.44%), followed by “Dukungan & Semangat Nasional” (80.70%), and “Hasil & Situasi Pertandingan” (79.37%), culminating in an average accuracy of 80.50%. These findings suggest that ABSA can provide detailed insights into public opinion regarding key performance areas of the national team."

    "abstract": "Motor impairment conditions like Parkinson's disease and essential tremor largely impact handwriting legibility, posing challenges to automated recognition systems. This paper presents an advanced CNN architecture with attention mechanisms tailored to adaptive handwritten alphabet recognition for motor impairment. A baseline CNN was developed achieving 81.3% accuracy, then integrated an advanced multi-head attention mechanism that incorporated channel and spatial attention blocks, Grad-CAM++ explainable AI was also utilized for visualizing model decision-making processes. Extensive ablation studies confirmed that the attention-enhanced model achieved 97.3% accuracy, which was a 16.0% improvement over the baseline. The explainable AI component efficiently pinpointed the most important regions affecting alphabet predictions. The proposed approach has great potential for building accessible handwriting recognition systems for individuals with motor impairments, with explainable AI ensuring transparency essential for assistive applications."

    "abstract": "In recent times, the major cause of the increased number of health issues and mortality is due to the unnoticed abnormal cell growth, causing cancer. Among these, lung cancer is regarded as the main reason behind increased death across the globe. Significantly, lung cancer is identified using the various screening techniques, of which Computed Tomography (CT) Scan images are widely considered due to their increased resolution. Nevertheless, existing detection techniques are prone to increased complexity in handling intricate data patterns. Therefore, this research seeks to design an enhanced approach for accurately identifying lung cancer through the analysis of CT scans. To achieve enhanced detection, an Optimized Explainable Gradient Convolution Gated Network (OXGCGN) model is designed, which enables better detection. Furthermore, deployment of Explainable Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBM) enables rectifying the errors, reducing the computational complexity, and loss value. XGBM is the integration of the gradient boosting technique, comprising various decision trees, offering simple, understandable outcomes, and facilitating effective lung cancer detection. The OXGCGN model performance is implemented using the Lung-PET-CT-Dx Dataset and achieves 97.23% of accuracy, 96.65% of F1-Score, 95.11%of precision, and 98.24% of recall, with a training percentage 80%, respectively, therefore providing better detection of lung cancer, enabling proper treatment facilities."

    "abstract": "Forensic sketching is crucial in criminal investigations, helping law enforcement identify suspects based on witness descriptions. However, traditional methods rely on skilled artists and are often subjective, making it difficult to integrate with automated facial recognition systems. The proposed methodology introduces a forensic tool with a drag-and-drop interface for composite sketch creation, reducing dependence on expert sketch artists while improving accessibility. Many automated forensic sketch retrieval techniques struggle with large-scale subject databases. Our system addresses this challenge by leveraging deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance image detection and classification. Unlike traditional approaches that focus only on sketch-based retrieval, our system incorporates real-time facial recognition from CCTV streams. This allows law enforcement agencies to crossreference live video feeds with suspect databases for efficient criminal identification. Real-time processing enables rapid suspect detection and tracking, significantly improving investigation speed and accuracy. By integrating deep learning models with forensic sketch matching, our system enhances modern biometric systems, making them more practical for large-scale deployments. This approach bridges the gap between forensic sketching and real-time recognition, making it a valuable tool for crime prevention and law enforcement."

Initially designed with a single core feature, the app aimed to demonstrate a focused experience that emphasized simplicity. However, as development progressed and feedback was gathered from early users, it became clear that minimal functionality was not enough to meet real-world expectations. The application underwent several iterations, eventually incorporating critical features such as real-time charging status updates, user account management, vehicle registration, and smart charging. These additions significantly improved the app’s usability without overwhelming its interface. Feedback from users revealed the need for personalization, intuitive flows, and transparency in energy usage. The development process highlighted the value of early user engagement and the importance of balancing minimalism with essential user needs. By reflecting on this journey, we propose a system that aligns with the needs of modern EV drivers and contributes to smarter energy usage and a more sustainable future."

    "abstract": "Motor Vehicle Tax (PKB) plays a crucial role in financing regional development in Indonesia. However, the application of data science to support the determination of tax rates and related incentives remains limited. This study implements a hybrid approach that combines Manhattan Frequency K-Means (MFKM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters for large-scale, categorical PKB datasets. The novelty lies in applying this combination—one of the earliest implementations of MFKM-PSO in large-scale tax data analysis in Indonesia—to a complex fiscal challenge, where existing methods struggle with both accuracy and efficiency. The resulting clusters are then interpreted to inform the design of more targeted and data-driven PKB incentive policies. Using 208,157 PKB records, the proposed method successfully identified three optimal clusters, supported by a Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) of 0.9072 and a Silhouette Score of 0.5312, within 38.53 seconds of computation time. Cluster interpretation and simulation of a rule-based incentive policy revealed potential for a 2.87% reduction in PKB loss, indicating practical relevance for fiscal decision-making."

We map the scattering behavior of the metasurfaces to a binary spin model, encoding each meta-atom's phase as spins, and optimize using a simulated bifurcation (SB) algorithm. Our method demonstrates a significant improvement in optimization efficiency, reducing computational time by nearly 1000 times compared to genetic algorithms (GA)."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of renewable energy sources is transforming power systems, leading to a significant decline in system inertia. To mitigate the resulting stability challenges, synthetic inertia—enabled through advanced control systems and fast responsive resources—has emerged as a promising solution. However, determining and procuring the optimal amount of synthetic inertia remains a critical challenge. This paper addresses the problem of synthetic inertia procurement by introducing a Public Good Game (PGG)-based optimization framework for power system utilities. The proposed approach determines the optimal inertia level by maximizing societal benefits while considering individual agent payoffs. Key frequency stability metrics—Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) and Nadir Point—are incorporated to evaluate the impact of inertia on system stability. Additionally, a mathematical formulation is developed to estimate the nadir point for different inertia levels within a typical power system. The study also examines the optimal cost of synthetic inertia and its allocation among system agents. A 500 MW power system is simulated to validate the proposed model's effectiveness in cost-efficient inertia procurement."

This may jeopardize the ability to satisfy customers’ energy requirements thus affecting system adequacy. The paper proposes a methodology to extend conventional adequacy analyses, accounting for long-lasting unavailabilities due to extreme events. To this aim, models and methodologies developed within the scope of resilience analyses are exploited, in particular allowing an efficient enumeration of relevant N-k unavailabilities. The extreme event analysis is then integrated by a conventional Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method to consider independent unavailabilities under ordinary operation. The application to a test system shows the capability of the proposed method to compute adequacy metrics (EENS and LOLE) due to long-lasting N-k unavailabilities caused by extreme events and compare them to ordinary unavailabilities."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning controllers trained in ideal smart-grid simulators fail to operate on real networks due to mismatches in underlying operational dynamics, e.g. battery efficiencies are often neglected or some charge sensors introduce random noise and biases. Our proposed two-layer transfer learning framework bridges this gap without requiring prior knowledge of the physical system (model-agnostic approach). We use an on-the-run trainable domain classifier, which reshapes the reward function to discourage actions that lead to unlikely situations in the target domain while training, and thus, steering learning towards optimal behaviors valid for the real domain. In parallel, a recurrent denoising autoencoder, trained with offline data extracted from scheduled operation, eliminates systematic and stochastic errors from the observation space before control decisions are made. The method was tested on a microgrid system, composed by a photovoltaic module, an electrical load and a battery, under three different efficiencies conditions and 10 random seeds. Our combined method achieved energy cost savings of up to 2.6% when the real efficiency is 80%, 17.5% for efficiency 65% and 10.2% for 50%, while maintaining safety voltage limits in the system. The method shows reliable simulation-to-reality transfer for energy networks proved by statistical significance tests. The overall transfer learning approach was designed to be extendable to grids with more nodes and different optimization objectives."

Long-wave-infrared (LWIR) cameras can detect animals day and night by sensing body heat, yet segmentation is difficult because distant wildlife occupy only a few low-contrast, noise-corrupted pixels. We introduce the Road-Thermal Deer dataset—160 expertly annotated frames expanded to 1600 im-age-mask pairs—and present the first systematic benchmark of hybrid CNN-Transformer encoders for roadside animal segmentation. A Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) branch is fused with five CNN backbones (MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B3, ResNet101, ResNeXt101) to study accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. The mid-capacity EfficientNet-B3 + ViT hybrid attains 41.2% IoU and 58.0% F1 while sustaining 21.3 fps at sub- 50 ms latency on an RTX 3080 and staying under 2GB peak VRAM—outperforming both the lightest hybrid (MobileNetV2 + ViT, 30.6 % IoU) and the heaviest (ResNeXt101 + ViT, 40.4% IoU). The dataset and code are publicly released, offering a reproducible baseline for integrating real-time wildlife perception into connected transportation infrastructure and enhancing roadway safety in future smart cities."

    "abstract": "Mental-health information are sensitive by nature but need to be aggregated to train robust machine-learning models capable of detecting depression, anxiety, PTSD, and bipolar disorders at scale. Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-safeguarding paradigm in which the models are locally trained and shared only via gradients or distilled parameters; however, plain vanilla FL continues to leak patient data via model weights or memorisation. From 2022 to 2025, the space quickly coalesced around differential-privacy (DP)-enabled FL, secure-aggregation methods, and customized federated fine-tuning for balancing high privacy budgets (ϵ ≤ 1) with clinical effectiveness. We conducted a systematic review of 43 peer-reviewed papers that deployed FL for mental-health prediction or monitoring on human data. Across depression, PTSD, bipolar, and stress tasks under stress, depression, PTSD, and bipolar conditions, privacy-hardened FL attained a pooled AUC of 0.87 ± 0.03, or a mean reduction of only 1.2% (95% CI 0.9–1.6%) compared to centralised baselines below the 3% non-inferiority threshold accepted by regulatory bodies for model equivalence. Perhaps most encThisagingly, multimodal wearable-to-text pipelines and large-language-model-based therapy chatbots provided the biggest privacy utility improvements when paired with adaptive DP budgets and LoRA-style parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Deployment issues persist non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data heterogeneity perturbed 91% of studies, and communication bottlenecks were encountered in 72%. We advocate a roadmap that integrates OMOP-CDM harmonisation, fairness constraints, and open-sThisce benchmarking to speed clinical translation. This results suggest that, through stringent privacy calibration, federated mental-health analytics can satisfy both ethical–legal requirements and clinical performance benchmarks, laying the foundation for population-scale yet privacy-preserving digital psychiatry."

    "abstract": "In oncology, financial toxicity (FT) is a term that describes the financial distress experienced by cancer patients as they undergo expensive clinical treatment. FT has been shown to have a negative effect on cancer patients’ well-being. The effects of FT can be especially pronounced when patients must undergo complex surgery as part of their treatment to promote survivability. Despite the prevalence of multiple forms of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the impacts of complex GI surgery on FT. Building on recent advances in this important subject, we propose a system to mechanize and streamline the process of FT modeling and prediction in the context of complex GI Surgery. Our aim is to provide healthcare professionals with an easy-to-use and intuitive system to proactively help them develop a personalized GI cancer treatment plan that also mitigates the risks associated with FT for individual cancer patients. We take a modular approach to system design that also includes futureproofing by adopting a plug-in mechanism for the critical machine learning (ML) module. This means the system can readily benefit from, and be in sync with, future advances in ML techniques. This paper describes the technical design of such a system. It demonstrates versatility of the system by exploring application of two popular ML methods for predicting FT formulated alternatively as classification and regression problems. Experimental results show promise in advancing ML for FT modeling and prediction."

The intersection of sensor networks and analytics has enabled crop and environmental condition monitoring, resource optimization, and increased sustainability. Despite these advances, conventional models are not capable of handling large volumes of heterogenous agricultural data, leading to inefficient resource allocation and inconsistent crop yields. The need for adaptive and intelligent solutions has grown in response to these limitations. This research proposes PrO-MSConvNet: Progression Optimized IoT-Based Precision Agriculture Using Morphable Schema Convolution Network, a robust methodology that begins with real-time data collection from IoT-enabled sensors measuring soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop growth. These inputs are transmitted through Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or LoRaWAN, depending on the scale and connectivity needs of the farm. The data is processed using a Morphable Schema Convolution Network (MSConvNet), which employs deformable convolution and pooling layers, as well as specialized regularizers, to model complex agricultural patterns and make preliminary predictions. These outputs are further refined by the Progression Optimizer (PrO), which dynamically fine-tunes recommendations for irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application through multi-agent evolutionary optimization. The proposed system achieves 99.5 % accuracy in predictive modeling, 99.8 % efficiency in resource allocation, 99.3 % yield estimation accuracy, 99.6 % disease identification accuracy, and 99.7 % recommendation precision. In conclusion, PrO-MSConvNet offers a significant advancement in IoT-based smart farming by enhancing productivity and sustainability through precise and adaptive resource management strategies."

However, non-linearities and binary variables inherent in hydraulics systems negatively affect the convergence and execution time. We present and test relaxation techniques for the pumped storage hydropower optimisation problem and compare different solving algorithms in real case scenarios. Relaxations improve the convergence of the solution, reduce execution times up to one order of magnitude and have close to no effect on the objective value. The ability to find a solution still depends on the initialisation values, so further development is required."

However, their effective deployment requires Power System Operators (PSOs) to monitor how these devices interact with the rest of the network, which is the Power System State Estimation (PSSE) goal. While existing studies embed FACTS in state estimators (SEs), few proposals address this issue under mixed measurement environments. Therefore, this paper uses Bayesian Inference to propose an SE formulation capable of tackling the temporal uncertainties that arise when combining traditional SCADA measurements with high sampling-rate Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) measurements. The proposed approach can leverage sparse PMU information to improve estimation accuracy and access fast events driven by FACTS. Results on a modified version of the IEEE 14 bus with FACTS demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional hybrid approaches."

Multi-object tracking from a UAV perspective faces many challenges. For instance, objects are often small and exhibit large scale variations, which complicates detection and the extraction of Re-ID features. Another challenge is that the computing power of UAV is usually limited at the edge, and an efficient and real-time tracking algorithm is urgently needed. Based on the above motivation, this paper proposes an end-to-end tracking algorithm: You Only Track Once (YOTO). Compared with the widely used tracking by detection algorithm, our algorithm directly adds a Re-ID branch to the YOLOv11 framework, which effectively uses the features extracted by the backbone network and saves the consumption of computing resources. In addition, we also propose a multi-scale target enhancement module. By introducing deep convolution in the neck of the detection network, we can extract clues of different scale features, so as to improve the detection ability of small targets from the perspective of aviation. According to experiments on two widely used UAV multi-object tracking datasets, VisDrone and UAVDT, our method surpasses many classical algorithms, achieving a MOTA of 44.5% and 51.2%, respectively."

    "abstract": "With increasing awareness about the need for sustainable waste management, automatic waste detection and tracking systems are becoming a crucial part of waste sorting and recycling processes. In this work, we present an object detection and tracking based waste identification system that extends previous work on waste classification with the ability to localize, detect, and track multiple waste objects in real-time. We also gain an insight as to various issues that such systems may face in the real world upon deployment. Unlike classification models that predict only a single label per image, our approach leverages state-of-the-art object detection architectures to identify waste items in both images and video streams, ensuring more effective waste monitoring and management. We evaluated different state-of-the-art object detection models for waste detection on our dataset. The dataset was manually annotated using various labelling tools and converted to appropriate formats depending upon the model. We eventually selected YOLO v12m for deployment after evaluating on a wide range of metrics including real-time inference speed and detection accuracy. To improve the performance of video-based waste detection, we added object tracking algorithms so that the system can keep track of the object identities across frames. This not only reduces the redundant detections but also improves the efficiency and helps to monitor the waste movement over time."

    "abstract": "This article analyzes the fidelity of the inverting operational amplifier under high-frequency conditions, primarily evaluating it from three aspects: gain characteristics, phase shift, and total harmonic distortion (THD). Simulink was used to build models of ideal and non-ideal inverting operational amplifiers, with simulations conducted at frequencies of 1 kHz, 1 MHz, and 100 MHz. By introducing parasitic capacitance and inductance of resistors, the effects of gain shift, signal transmission delay, and harmonic distortion were calculated and verified. The results indicate that at low (1 kHz) and medium (1 MHz) frequencies, the gain error of the inverting operational amplifier is relatively small, and the frequency response remains stable. However, at high frequency (100 MHz), parasitic effects lead to a gain reduction of about 0.8 %, a phase shift of 7°, and an increase in harmonic distortion to 3.06%. The study shows that the inverting operational amplifier can still maintain high fidelity within 100 MHz. However, at higher frequencies, the impact of parasitic parameters must be considered to optimize circuit design and enhance operational amplifier performance."

However, the quadratic complexity of Softmax attention hinders scalability in environments with large number of agents or long episodes. To reduce the complexity in standard MAT, we propose to integrate the Linear attention into the standard MAT instead of the Softmax attention. The Linear attention is able to reduce the quadratic complexity in large number of agents thanks to having linear complexity via a kernel based operator. Moreover, the proposed linear operator is expected to better adapt to the dynamics in multi-agent interactions than the Softmax implementation. Through extensive experiments on benchmark MARL environments including MPE, MA-MuJoCo, and SMACLite, we show that the Linear attention architecture achieves competitive performance to its Softmax counterpart. Our findings suggest that Linear attention is a viable drop-in alternative for efficient sequence modeling in MARL, laying the groundwork for future progress in lightweight MARL architectures."

Lens antennas, based on geometrical optics (GO), use shaped dielectrics to refract EM waves and achieve wide bandwidth and high directivity. However, their thickness increases with aperture size, often reaching several wavelengths. Transmitarray antennas use sub-wavelength unit cells to introduce phase shifts for wavefront control, maintaining a thin profile independent of aperture size. While their bandwidth is narrower due to resonant elements, transmitarrays offer advantages in compactness and integration.

    "abstract": "In large-scale resource-constrained wireless networks, such as those prevalent in the Internet of Things (IoT), efficient communication scheduling remains a critical challenge. Among the various approaches, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols have been widely adopted for their structured and collision-free communication capabilities. Nevertheless, despite extensive research in this area, current solutions often exhibit suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic environments where node activity levels fluctuate over time.This paper introduces a novel fully distributed TDMA-based scheduling protocol that intelligently maximizes the utilization of communication resources. The proposed approach adaptively reallocates underutilized time slots, originally assigned to temporarily inactive nodes, to those experiencing higher communication demands. This dynamic reallocation not only improves channel utilization but also reduces idle periods, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a lightweight probabilistic mechanism that governs the temporal leasing of unused slots. This mechanism balances the trade-off between slot availability and transmission reliability, minimizing packet loss while preserving fairness and stability within the network.Simulations across a range of network scenarios demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves throughput, latency, and reliability in resource-constrained environments. These results highlight the protocol’s potential as a robust and scalable solution for adaptive and energy-efficient scheduling in next-generation IoT networks."

When there are some changes in the surrounding environment and causes mismatch, we can re-match it by adjusting the reverse bias applied to the varactor diode. The simulation results show that for a load of 120+j50Ω, when the bias voltage of the three varactor diodes is set to 2V, S11 at 2.4GHz can be reduced to less than -15dB. When the bias voltage is set to 2.3, 1.3, and 1.8Vrespectively, S11 can be reduced to less than -40dB at 2.4GHz. When the real part changes between 40~200Ω, or the imaginary part changes between -150~150Ω, S11 at 2.4GHz can also be reduced to below -40dB by giving an appropriate voltage to achieve impedance matching."

    "abstract": "Accurate power estimation in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs is a persistent challenge due to increasing architectural complexity, multiple power domains, and dynamic operating conditions. Traditional spreadsheet-based methods are often inadequate for capturing the nuanced behavior of hierarchical systems, especially when components operate under varying voltage, temperature, and process scenarios. As SoCs scale in size and functionality, the need for a flexible, scalable, and precise power modeling framework becomes critical. Designers require tools that can simulate real-world operating modes, support iterative development, and provide actionable insights into power distribution across the chip. This paper introduces a Python-based framework that addresses these challenges by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) with backend computational logic for hierarchical power estimation. The framework employs a master-instance methodology. Higher-level master cells instantiate lower-level cells, forming a scalable hierarchy that accurately models power behavior across multiple levels of abstraction. Each instantiated cell retains its own power mode configuration, enabling accurate power estimate under varying conditions. Results are visualized in a hierarchical tree format, offering clear insights into power distribution across domains and components. This structure supports drill-down analysis, allowing designers to identify power-intensive modules and make informed decisions about redesigns or optimizations."

Four feature extraction techniques—FFT, STFT, WT, and ST—are combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and benchmarked against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on Hilbert-transformed signal envelopes.

A triangular region is introduced within the phasar array to enable wavelength-selective switching through controlled refractive index variation. Simulation results show that for different angular parameters, light coupling behavior varies significantly. The appropriate change in wavelength redirects light to the required output channel. In SAS structure, light enters the appropriate output channel similarly to SA (Straight–Arc), but with reduced electric field intensity. This reduction is attributed to the more gradual transition in SAS geometry, which allows the electric field lines to reorganize more uniformly after the arc, minimizing local maxima and suppressing field peaking. However, the ASAS-90° structure, while offering field intensity comparable to SA, exhibits sporadic distribution and consistent deflection to the left channel due to asymmetrical bending and structural discontinuities. Precise tuning of the length increment (ΔL) between the phasar array waveguides enables optimal phase matching, compensates for asymmetries, and enhances channel-selective performance."

This paper presents a novel approach for deceptive jamming identification in single-channel SAR using a short-time Fourier transform residual diffusion model (STFT-RDM). We first develop a frequency-shifted forwarding deceptive jamming signal model and analyze the distinctions between real SAR echo signals and deceptive jamming signals in the time-frequency domain. The proposed STFT-RDM algorithm applies a short-time Fourier transform to the range-compressed signal, processes the real and imaginary components through a diffusion network with residual learning to extract jamming features, and performs an inverse transform to obtain the results of deceptive jamming identification. Experimental validation using simulated data from a drone-mounted single-channel SAR demonstrates that STFT-RDM effectively identifies deceptive jamming signals from real echoes, significantly enhancing the ability of SAR systems to recognize deceptive jamming."

Based on the aerodynamic modeling and machine learning approaches, the algorithm adapts the control parameters according to the changes in the environment to maintain stability and accuracy. The results of the various simulation studies indicate that this nonlinear control approach offers enhanced tracking of desired trajectories, reduced energy consumption, and better rejection of disturbances as compared to the conventional control techniques. In addition, a proof of concept implementation in a quadcopter UAV is utilized to establish the effectiveness of the proposed method through reallife experimentation under different wind conditions. It was found that there is a significant decrease in deviation errors and enhanced flight stability."

    "abstract": "The integration of digital twinning technologies is driving next-generation networks toward new capabilities, allowing operators to thoroughly understand network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources, mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT) framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer, merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs for corresponding task development."

    "abstract": "In Previous Papers Wearing safety helmets can effectively protect workers safety on construction sites. However, workers often take off their helmets because of weak security-consciousness and discomfort, then hidden dangers will be brought by this behavior. Workers without safety helmets will suffer more injuries in accidents such as falling human body and vertical falling matter. Hence, detecting safety helmet wearing is a vital step of construction sites safety management and a safety helmet detector with high speed and accuracy is urgently needed. However, traditional manual monitor is labor intensive and methods of installing sensors on safety helmets are difficult to popularize. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning-based method to detect safety helmet wearing at a satisfactory accuracy with high detection speed. Our method chooses YOLO v5 as the baseline, then the fourth detection scale is added to predict more bounding boxes for small objects and the attention mechanism is adopted in the backbone of the network to construct more informative features for following concatenation operations. In order to overcome the defects caused by insufficient data, targeted data augmentation and transfer learning are used.Helmet detection plays a critical role in ensuring road safety by effectively identifying whether a person is wearing a helmet or not. By analyzing images or video footage, the system can swiftly identify offenders who neglect to wear helmets while riding. This technology not only aids in enforcing safety measures but also contributes to reducing the number of accidents and injuries caused by inadequate head protection. Moreover, the integration of YOLOv8 in helmet detection systems enhances the overall effectiveness and reliability of enforcing helmet-wearing regulations on roadways, ultimately fostering a safer environment for all road users."

    "abstract": "The recent introduction of Energy Communities into European legislation is set to change the paradigm of energy production and consumption. Multiple users can now aggregate to form groups of so-called prosumers, a term that identifies entities which are both producers and consumers of energy. Prosumers share loads, renewable energy production, and storage resources within the energy community, thereby achieving environmental and economic benefits. One of the objectives of introducing energy communities is to stimulate a hybrid form of distributed generation systems based on renewable energy technologies. These energy systems share a connection to the national power grid, but at the same time, they are encouraged to produce and consume their energy locally; to alleviate the stress and potential stability problems that a high share of renewable energy can cause on the power grid. However, due to the complexity of these energy systems and the high number of variables involved, the creation of such communities must overcome several challenges to be effective and to generate benefits for their members. For example, the fluctuating nature of renewable energy sources, such as solar power, introduces a component of unpredictability that must be addressed with storage systems. Moreover, the possibility of injecting a portion of the self-produced energy into the grid may generate additional revenues by exploiting periods of high electricity prices. In this context, one of the most significant challenges is the management of the community's assets—such as controllable loads and battery storage systems—to ensure optimal exploitation of renewable energy sources and maximum economic gain. To this end, this work analyses the case study of a photovoltaic energy community located in Northern Italy, composed of eight prosumers, and proposes an optimization strategy for the allocation of controllable assets, such as loads and battery systems, with the objective of maximizing economic benefit. The results demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of these renewable energy system solutions. The energy community has been modelled in a Python programming environment, and an optimization tool based on a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver has been developed."

Experiments are based on data from 1,000 elderly patients at a tertiary hospital (covering physiological signals, imaging, clinical text, and behavioral data). The dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:1.5:1.5 ratio. Performance is compared with five comparison models. Results show that MAFN achieves an RMSE of 3.25±0.42, a MAE of 2.18±0.31, and an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.92 in predicting FIM score improvement, representing improvements of 15.3%, 12.6%, and 4.5 percentage points, respectively, compared to the Transformer fusion model.

This invention talks about a system that creates captions for images on its own. It uses deep learning bringing together CNNs and LSTMs. Traditionally, to generate image captions or descriptions of it, it requires manual labeling or limited rule-based approaches which may not concentrate on the entire actual descriptions of the images. The proposed model would reduce the complexity and ensure that it enhances the quality of descriptions generated, especially using ResNet50 and LSTM. CNNs are the primary component in the proposed model as they have the ability to capture and extract detailed and hierarchical features from images. When image is given as input, then CNN processes it by isolating patterns like edges, textures, and objects. Input image is then transformed into a feature, rich representation. The features generated are of high dimensional vector. These features are then fed into LSTM, which interprets the spatial and semantic meaning within these features. The CNNLSTM combination allows the model to identify objects and their relationships within images."

During the peak activity period of the meteor shower predicted by the International Meteor Organization (IMO), by recording the signal field strength and phase values, it was found that the enhancement of the signal field strength increased by approximately 1 dBμV/m at noon during the day, and the field strength at night was up to 4 dBμV/m higher. The phase values showed a relatively stable phenomenon during the meteor shower. The results support the fact that meteors have an effect on the ionosphere in the atmosphere, enhancing the field strength value of the LF signal. Experiments also show that LF can be a powerful tool for detecting meteor showers during the day, exploring the influence mechanism, extent and future applications of meteors on low-frequency radio communications."

For speed predictions in multiple traffic scenarios, knowledge contained in a traffic scenario can be leveraged by similar others, with the hope of improving the generalization performance of speed prediction models. Our key observation is that the shifts of temporal dynamics among traffic speed flows may bring misleading knowledge sharing. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Sharing framework based on multi-task learning that autonomously determines when to share knowledge, tailored to prevailing spatial-temporal states, with the goal of improving traffic speed prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-arts in terms of MAE and RMSE."

    "abstract": "A decline in inertia poses substantial challenges to power system stability, particularly during large-scale grid separation events. To address this issue, this work proposes a three-stage framework for the regional allocation of system needs for inertia. The approach begins with the identification of critical grid separation topologies. Next, composite demand areas for inertia are defined through the superimposition of these topologies. In the final stage, a linear optimization problem is formulated and solved to minimize the total system-wide inertia, ensuring that the inertia needs of each composite demand area are satisfied and then appropriately allocated across predefined regions. Applied to a exemplary scenario, the proposed method reveals regional disparities in the spatial distribution of system needs for inertia across Germany. The results also indicate that, while inertia needs generally remain moderate throughout the year, a limited number of critical hours are characterized by significant demand peaks."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in both EVs increased range and rapidly expanded charging infrastructure has made everyday travels with EVs increasingly convenient. Based on the mobility patterns of the EV fleet, local electricity networks experience increasing spatio-temporal variation in electricity demand. In the worst case, this could impose more stress on the local electricity networks. To detect, which locations experience highest power increases from EVs, more detailed analysis is needed. This paper proposes an open data based correlation analysis, in which several selected DC charging station usage rates are compared to the nearby traffic volume measurements. The objective of the analysis is to increase understanding on how accurately current traffic volumes correlate with DC charging station usage rates in different locations. Because traffic volumes typically follow rather easily predictable patterns, the correlation could be used to predict power demand at DC charging stations in the near future. With presented open data-based methodology, case study from Finland analyzed the correlation at 13 different locations. The results found strongest correlations along TEN-T core network, highlighting highest average correlation (0.86) in Heinola. Additionally, average correlation on regular (0.59) and holiday weekends (0.61) were found to be stronger than correlations on regular (0.46) and holiday weekdays (0.54), indicating increased DC charging demand relative to the traffic volumes."

This paper introduces a novel offloading framework that leverages real-time environmental information sensed by JCAS base stations to dynamically estimate the privacy risk associated with each offloading link. Based on these context-aware risk estimates, UE selects among local, Device-to-Device (D2D), or edge execution modes to minimize a composite cost function balancing privacy leakage and delay. A lightweight greedy scheduler is applied to solve the offloading decision problem efficiently under deadline constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces effective privacy leakage with negligible latency overhead, consistently outperforming context-agnostic baseline strategies."

    "abstract": "The flexible DC traction power supply system has lower losses and higher efficiency compared with the traditional AC railway electrification system. Meanwhile, it has the advantages of easy access to new energy and energy storage equipment. However, increased new energy and energy storage ports will be directly coupled with traction substations and locomotives through the DC traction network, and there are dynamic changes in the position of multiple locomotives. This will significantly increase the complexity of power flow analysis and the computing time. Thus, in this paper, an optimized power flow computation algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the mathematical model of the flexible DC traction power supply system is established for the power flow algorithm. Then, the advantages of the parallel computing method are analyzed. The computation model is validated by comparison with simulation results. Besides, considering the limitations of the parallel computing method, an optimization method for the algorithm iteration process based on fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed in this paper. According to the calculation results, the computation time is reduced from 3.214 seconds to 2.673 seconds under the FNN-based method."

With an encoder-decoder structure, it integrates a multi-Scale feature fusion module (MFFM) using parallel dilated convolutionsand a squeeze-sxcitation (SE) attention mechanism. MFFM captures multi-scale features of molten steel, while SE enhances relevant features and suppresses noise. Evaluated on a self-built dataset of images from converter steel tapping and continuous casting scenarios, MSA-Unet outperforms traditional methods in segmenting molten steel regions and handling complex conditions. Ablation experiments verify the synergistic benefits of MFFM and SE.

    "abstract": "The demand for Edge Computing in Industry 4.0 is significant, especially in production environments where rapid decision-making is essential. However, implementing Edge Computing solutions in an industrial Internet of Things (IoT) network poses substantial challenges, including scalability. This paper presents a systematic literature review on IoT solutions with Edge Computing in Industry 4.0, aiming to support software architects in acquiring empirical data necessary for the development of new reference architectures (RAs). By employing systematic literature review methodologies, this study was able to identify important artifacts in the literature for the development of new architectures, such as non-functional requirements, software solutions, middleware, and other RAs. Additionally, it provides a methodology for empirical data acquisition and an introduction to the topic."

    "abstract": "The rising popularity of the Internet of Things and wireless sensing applications calls for energy-efficient and scalable communication protocols. LoRaWAN is one of today’s most prominent choices for this purpose, as it features long communication ranges and high energy-efficiency. However, a major drawback is its limitation to being operated in a star topology. Thus, data originating from nodes outside of the single-hop neighborhood of a gateway cannot be received. We overcome this limitation by presenting Backpack-LoRa, an extension to LoRaWAN which enables multi-hop uplink communication while being compatible with existing deployments. Instead of simply re-transmitting overheard frames entirely, however, Backpack-LoRa nodes extract and buffer only the relevant frame content for later decryption and append it to their own frames, which are transmitted during the next regular transmission slots. To address the limitation of most commodity transceivers – only being able to listen on one out of multiple available channels – we propose a pseudo-random channel allocation algorithm based on time and device address for Backpack-LoRa. We implement our approach in a real-world outdoor deployment consisting of four nodes and gateways. Subsequently, we analyze the improvements in network coverage, packet reception rate, and energy overhead. Our results show that Backpack-LoRa enables nodes to reach gateways which were unreachable for standard LoRaWAN and increase the packet reception rate by up to 54.9 %. As compared to a simple re-transmission approach, Backpack-LoRa can reduce the energy overhead by 28.8 %."

    "abstract": "Maritime ports play a vital role in global economic activity and international trade, with shipping being the most efficient and widely used method for cargo transportation. Given this significance, the sector is facing increasing challenges due to national and international decarbonization targets. One of the key solutions being implemented is the Shore-Side Power (SSP)—the connection of ships to the Port's electrical grid while docked—which fundamentally transforms the role of seaports and demands new approaches to power and control infrastructure. This paper proposes linear optimization considering two scenarios. Both scenarios address energy management within a port, incorporating SSP alongside internal distributed energy resources such as controllable loads, photovoltaic (PV) generation, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and a fleet of electric vehicles. The scenarios differ in the number of ships that are docked in the Port. In the first Scenario, it is assumed that three cruise ships are docked (full capacity). In the second scenario it is assumed that no cruise ships will use tthe port The scenarios were developed considering the application in Port of Funchal in Portugal."

While deep learning has significantly advanced DR detection, most state-of-the-art models remain computationally intensive and unsuitable for widespread clinical use in resource-limited settings. Our approach introduces a lesion-aware knowledge distillation strategy that enhances the student model's ability to recognize critical DR biomarkers by aligning attention maps from a high-capacity teacher model. In addition, a temperature-scaled divergence mechanism improves the transfer of fine-grained class relationships, addressing the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation methods. The proposed model achieves 93.7% accuracy and a 0.912 F1-score, closely matching the teacher model's performance while using 88% fewer parameters and delivering a 5.8×speed-up in inference. Importantly, it demonstrates substantial gains in early-stage DR detection and lesion-specific sensitivity, enabling timely intervention and supporting human-AI collaboration in clinical settings. These results establish a practical path toward scalable, accurate, and efficient DR screening."

    "abstract": "The shift toward Smart Learning Environments (SLE) constitutes a key aspect of digital transformation in education, requiring systematic approaches for maturity assessment and development. However, a research gap remains, the construction of factors and dimensions in existing SLE maturity models has predominantly relied on qualitative analyses of conceptual frameworks, which limits the generalizability and scalability. While quantitative bibliometric techniques offer computational efficiency, they are typically restricted to processing metadata-such as titles, abstracts, and author keywords-without accessing the full semantic depth of the literature. To address these methodological limitations, this study applies a corpus-based mixed-methods approach. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling was used to analyze a dataset of 375 full-text scientific articles, resulting in the identification of 55 latent topics. These topics were further examined through qualitative content analysis using facets and quotations to extract 17 maturity factors. These factors were classified into five conceptual dimensions: technology-based supporting system, student profiling system, teacher development system, teaching and learning system, and technology-based educational management. The fivedimensional conceptual model encapsulates the complexity of SLE development and offers a structured basis for evaluation and continuous enhancement. The model will guide the next development phase for assessing SLE maturity, with future work focusing on benchmarking against established frameworks (e.g., CMMI), model, and instruments to validate its robustness."

    "abstract": "Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web, retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems."

Unlike its traditional visualization, the organization of chromatin is 3D and can be measured with whole-genome sequencing technologies such as Hi-C sequencing, the results of which are often graphically represented as flat 2D heat-maps or a 1D curve that looks like a hairball. Here we discuss a novel approach to represent these and other genomic data by transforming the visualization of the genome from a 1D curve embedded in 3D into a structured 3D volume. This abstraction prioritizes 3D spatial proximity of chromatin and enables advanced techniques like clipping, thresholding, and contouring. Our method allows for multi-variable encoding, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret multivariate relationships, offering a more complete and effective representation of genomic structures, chromosome organization, and data relationships."

Existing solutions primarily rely on continuous-time models, but their ubiquitous matrix inversion operations significantly increase computational complexity. To avoid matrix inversion, a diagonal scaling (DS) gradient processing method is proposed in this study. Building upon this method, three discrete-time gradient neural network models are constructed: the DS momentum acceleration (DSMA) model, the DS gradient integration (DSGI) model , and the DS recurrent neurodynamics (DSRN) model. Among them, the DSGI model exhibits the best performance. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is then established to ensure that the DSGI model generates a solution converging to the optimal solution. Finally, evaluations on one numerical experiment demonstrates that the DSGI model not only satisfies all constraints but also surpasses other existing discrete-time gradient models in terms of comprehensive performance and computational efficiency."

Weather variables leading up to 12 hours of outage occurrence are considered. The Recurrent Neural Network is the best performing model among both regions, with a testing accuracy of 0.92 for Los Angeles County and 0.89 for Colorado. A real-time forecasting tool that integrates weather forecasts to predict future outages is also deployed using the knowledge from the models trained on historical data.

    "abstract": "The shortcomings of cloud computing computation performance are usually poor resource distribution and the inability to sustain service-level agreements (SLAs) with dynamic and unpredictable workloads. Current solutions like metaheuristic optimization, machine learning, clustering and reinforcement learning have been promising. As a case example, whale optimization and hybrid NSGA-II task scheduling algorithm efficiency reduced task latency by up to 20% and 12-18 % energy efficiency, and load balancing based on reinforcement learning minimized violations of SLA by 15 %. Likewise in cloud fog IoT systems, machine learning predictions of workloads reduced provisioning errors by 22%, and energy-sensitive scheduling reduced energy use by almost 10 to 25%. Nonetheless, the majority of these solutions are performance optimized or energy usage optimized in isolation, they do not consider their interaction in a heterogeneous and multi-tenant workload. To close this gap, the paper presents an Adaptive Dual-Layer Resource Allocation Framework (ADRAF), which combines proactive workload prediction based on a hybrid machine learning-reinforcement learning framework with multi-objective metaheuristic resource allocation optimization decision-making. Simulations indicate that ADRAF can reach a 25% SLA compliance and 30% energy savings, as compared to existing plans. A fresh development of this is introduction of context aware migration policies which allow work to move dynamically between cloud, fog and edge tiers depending on latency and energy compensation, thereby enhancing sustainability and adaptability to next-generation applications."

Detecting such shortcomings in the field proves difficult because the symptoms are similar to those of pests, diseases, or abiotic stress, and laboratory tests are expensive and time-consuming. This research paper aims to establish a robust and explainable deep learning model for accurately and promptly identifying micronutrient deficiencies in sugarcane. We present a new system, NutriCaneNet, that uses four major modules: (i) Stage-Aware Normalization to reduce variability in colour expression across growth stages, (ii) Distilled Segmentation to extract leaf regions precisely and cheaply, (iii) Fusion of Image and spectral-texture in a growth-conscious manner, and (iv) Energy-Based Guardrails to measure the uncertainty of prediction and detect confounding non-nutrient stresses. The models were trained and evaluated on a curated dataset of annotated leaf images, in combination with a laboratory tissue assay. Site- and season-based splits ensured strong generalisation. In a comparative experiment, NutriCaneNet is characterized by a macro-F1 score of 0.82, whereas Support Vector Machine (0.61), Random Forest (0.65), CNN-ResNet (0.73), EfficientNet-B0 (0.76), and Swin Transformer (0.78) are characterized by a lower score. Through these results, it is evident that NutriCaneNet can serve as a valuable decision-support tool for managing sugarcane precision nutrient management."

    "abstract": "Wide bandgap (WBG)-based multilevel inverters are gaining widespread attention due to their superior switching speed, efficiency, and power density. In particular, the integration of low-voltage gallium nitride (GaN) devices into neutral-point clamped (NPC) three-level inverters offers significant performance improvements but also introduces new challenges. One critical issue observed is voltage unbalance across the switching devices, which occurs independently of dc-link capacitor voltage imbalance. This phenomenon originates from high frequency switching transients. It persists even after the system reaches steady-state operation. However, accurately identifying the root cause of this unbalance is nontrivial. This difficulty arises from the complex interaction of multiple high-frequency current paths and parasitic couplings within the NPC topology. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a unit-cell-based analytical model that captures the switch voltage unbalance behavior in diode-clamped multilevel inverters. The model is developed using state-space analysis applied to a simplified unit cell. This cell consists of two voltage sources, two switches, and a clamping diode. The simplification reduces circuit complexity while isolating the dominant dynamics responsible for the observed behavior. The analysis reveals that the fundamental cause of the voltage unbalance is a resonant interaction that charges the output capacitance of the clamping diode, leading to a non-zero residual voltage. Furthermore, the study identifies key parasitic parameters—specifically, device output capacitance, parasitic inductance, and switching <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dv</i>/<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dt</i>—as major contributors to the severity of the voltage unbalance. Among these, the parasitic inductance at the neutral point is found to have the most significant impact. The validity of the proposed model is verified through LTspice simulations. Experimental results are obtained from a hardware setup comprising a single NPC inverter module built using two GaN-based half-bridge units. These results confirm the existence and characteristics of the voltage unbalance under varying conditions of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dv</i>/<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dt</i>, device capacitance, and load.

    "abstract": "The rise of deepfakes poses a significant threat to public trust in digital content, particularly when presented on social media platforms where fabricated videos of political leaders, influencers, or celebrities can rapidly go viral. These convincing manipulations fuel misinformation, distort public opinion, promote scams, and challenge the integrity of content on social media. Additionally, with the recent shift from unimodal to multimodal deepfake generation, detection systems face increasing difficulty when identifying forgeries that combine both visual and audio manipulation. Traditional detection methods often fail to generalize across unseen manipulations or domains, limiting their practicality on dynamic, real-world social media content. To address this challenge, we propose domain-adaptive representation learning (DARL), a novel framework that leverages the inherent correlation between the audio and visual modalities using a deep canonical correlation analysis network. DARL effectively learns robust audio–visual representations by integrating knowledge from speech recognition domains, enhancing its ability to detect both LipSync and face-swap deepfakes. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and generalization across five benchmark datasets, along with a locally collected real-world deepfake advertisements dataset that features audio–visual deepfake social media content, highlighting its potential as a reliable defense mechanism against the spread of deepfake-induced misinformation on social media platforms."

    "abstract": "The security of voice control in the Voice Internet of Things (Voice IoT) heavily relies on the fast and accurate authentication of the command issuer. In this work, we focus on the critical application scenario of Voice IoT in underground coal mines, where voice commands typically last 4–10 seconds. Speech in this scenario typically consists of short, imperative utterances and faces challenges from environmental noise and device heterogeneity. The limitations of traditional speaker verification models in temporal modeling restrict their performance in such scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes a three-dimensional attention module (Branch-MFA) designed for Voice IoT. This module employs a dual-parallel branch architecture: the MFA branch is responsible for extracting attention in the frequency and channel dimensions, and its multi-scale nature enables it to effectively focus on speaker-discriminative frequency bands that remain stable under noise and different collection devices, thereby enhancing the model’s environmental robustness; the GLTA branch, through its innovative grouped variable-length attention mechanism, specifically models the temporal structure of these short voice commands, addressing the challenge of sparse temporal information in short utterances. By integrating the dual-branch outputs through a fusion module, we construct the Branch-MFA-TDNN model. Experiments on the Cn-Celeb dataset show that this model significantly outperforms baseline models in short-utterance verification tasks, particularly for the challenging 4–10 second duration relevant to mine communications, providing an identity authentication solution for Voice IoT that combines high security and real-time performance.

    "abstract": "This study addresses children’s fear of medical toys through perceived design affordance (PDA) and develops a mediation guided pathway from interpretable design variables to generative optimization. We constructed 9 dimensions, 5 level semantic space (Color, Material, Humanization, Environmental Interaction, Structure, Function orientation, Sound, Scale, Customization) around five core medical elements to generate 45 scene images. In 151 children (3–12 years) with matched parent and observer reports, mixed effects and mediation analyses support the chain Design → PDA → Fear → Approach/Cooperation. The child PDA composite shows good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.85) and converges with the parent proxy scale (α = 0.96; r = 0.93). Observer hesitation aligns with fear (r = 0.80) and cooperation aligns with PDA (r = 0.71). Dimension wise, moderate color and sound intensities increase affinity, whereas extreme scale and dense sound cues elevate fear. Approach/cooperation is sensitive to PDA (β = 0.70), while fear’s direct effect becomes nonsignificant once PDA enters the model. These parameters inform an interpretable reward function that, combined with safety constraints and persona weights, trains predictors of PDA and fear to re rank generated designs. Compared with an aesthetics only baseline, the proportion of high PDA/low fear candidates in Top k lists and ranking concordance improve while constraint violations decrease. Rather than claiming a fully behaviorally validated evidence-guided pipeline, the study demonstrates a bridge from mediation estimates to generation and offers actionable rules: within safety bounds, use moderate intensity, harmony, and legibility to build an “affordance plateau,” then layer light customization and interactivity to reduce fear and promote cooperation."

The proposed approach introduces a novel scheme that employs two Extended High Gain Observers (EHGOs) to efficiently estimate the inverted pendulum’s linear and angular velocities, as well as the unknown disturbances, independently. The control strategy integrates a nonlinear hierarchical Lyapunov-based framework with EHGOs to tackle complex trajectory-tracking missions. Leveraging the differential flatness property of the FIP system, a versatile trajectory generation method is developed for window-crossing maneuvers. This work marks a step toward achieving closed-loop integration of trajectory generation and nonlinear control for the aggressive maneuvering of an underactuated FIP. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are validated through numerical simulations and experimental tests, using an underactuated aerial vehicle as a benchmark."

    "abstract": "Due to inherent sensor discrepancies, hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR data in fusion classification tasks often suffer from spatial misalignment and limited high-quality annotations, which severely constrain classification performance. While some recent methods attempt to address these issues by introducing semantic alignment strategies or contrastive learning (CL), challenges such as inconsistent cross-modal representations and limited semantic generalization still persist. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-assisted adaptive registration and fusion classification network (TARCNet). First, we develop a feature adaptive alignment (FAA) module, which adaptively adjusts LiDAR features to alleviate semantic inconsistency under misregistration. Second, we introduce a text-assisted contrastive learning (TCL) module, which leverages linguistic priors to strengthen cross-modal consistency and improve the discriminability of the learned representations. Third, we incorporate a multi-loss joint optimization (MLO) module to ensure consistent and stable optimization across heterogeneous modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three HSI-LiDAR datasets with misregistration and limited annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability."

The proposed approach employs an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to enable a hidden detection strategy (HDS) that triggers based on variations in system frequency and optimal power sharing commands (OPSC). The developed approach is tested on multiple attack vectors, including a data-driven coordinated FDI attack to manipulate the OPSC and voltage measurements in the communication lines between primary and supervisory control layers, and a malware attack to manipulate inertia and damping coefficient (IDC) values in the primary controller. The proposed method enables real-time estimation of system trajectories, specifically frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF), under system variations and disturbances. These trajectories are used to assess system dynamics and detect the presence of attacks. The proposed AI-IDC-HDS is validated on a modified 9-bus IEEE system. Furthermore, a small-scale hardware setup is used for experimental validation."

This highlights the necessity for online model training or adaptation, where devices locally process training data and perform adaptation via on-device engines. Such capabilities and technologies are essential for various wireless AI/ML features requiring on-device inference to be considered in the upcoming Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 6G standardization works. For battery-powered devices, model adaptation must be efficiently executed in real-time with well-designed timelines, as environmental conditions can change rapidly and vary significantly across locations. In this paper, we present results from over-the-air (OTA) prototyping experiments using handset devices to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of real-time on-device adaptation. We use AI/ML based beam prediction, as outlined by 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards, as an example. Our OTA results show that on-device model adaptation can be completed within 30 seconds in an unfamiliar environment to achieve benchmark performance, strongly supporting the feasibility of real-time on-device model adaptation in 6G communications. The findings and methodologies discussed in this paper can be extended to benefit various other wireless and non-wireless real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles must obey the rules of the road to safely participate in road traffic. To enforce these rules during motion planning, they are often formalized in temporal logic. Such formalizations need to be very general to cover all possible traffic situations, resulting in large and complex logic formulas. During motion planning, however, we are usually confronted with a concrete scenario in which parts of the formulas may be irrelevant. Since specification-compliant motion planning under complex specifications is computationally challenging, we aim to simplify the traffic rules by removing these irrelevant parts. To this end, we first present a general algorithm that augments linear temporal logic formulas with scenario-specific knowledge. Then, we provide a method for extracting knowledge from traffic scenarios to augment traffic rules. We can formally guarantee that the augmented specification is equivalent to the original formula in the given scenario. Therefore, subsequent motion planning modules that handle temporal logic specifications need only consider the augmented formulas. We benchmark our approach in recorded real-world scenarios to demonstrate that it can significantly accelerate specification-compliant motion planning."

Liu et al. proposed a fog-blockchain-assisted certificateless aggregate signcryption (FB-ASC) scheme to achieve confidentiality and unforgeability in smart grids. Our research demonstrates that their signcryption design achieves neither confidentiality nor unforgeability, and we show that the supporting lemmas in their paper do not hold. Under the same system models, we presented effective attacks on their scheme and consequently proposed the FB-ASC+ scheme that provides provable security guarantees against the aforementioned attacks. Comparison results further illustrate its performance advantages over pairing-based alternatives in typical smart-grid scenarios."

The initial stage of the algorithm is devoted to reaching the optimal solution of all local time-varying cost functions within the preset time. Subsequently, the second stage of the algorithm aims to reach the global optimal solution within the preset time, while ensuring that the sum of all gradients remains zero.

    "abstract": "In this article, the bandpass responses with predefined reflection zeros (PRZs) are synthesized directly in the bandpass domain and then used to extract the wideband coupling matrix (WCM). Since different parameter combinations of the bandpass responses result in different transversal topologies, 18 different cases are systematically enumerated and analyzed here for the first time. Among them, ten new cases of WCMs with distinct residual parts emerge with the introduction of PRZs. The equal-ripple bandpass responses with PRZs are synthesized by modifying the Remez iteration. The responses with different numbers of PRZs are compared to illustrate the influence of PRZs. The results show that introducing PRZs can enhance the rectangular coefficient of a filter under the same number of in-band reflection zeros (IRZs). To implement the WCM with PRZs, the conversion equations of WCM components to coupled-line components are derived. Two design examples are given to demonstrate the applications, one is a two-IRZ wide-stopband filter, and the other one is a six-IRZ wide-passband filter. In the two-IRZ example, the traditional coupling matrix (TCM) method is compared with the WCM method to highlight the limitations of TCM. In addition, the responses with zero, one, and two PRZs are compared, showing that the two-PRZ case provides an extra transmission zero (TZ) at infinity frequency under the same topology compared with the non-PRZ case. Finally, both designs are fabricated as stripline filters, and the measured results agree well with the simulations, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

We consider that the users are divided into multiple user groups (UGs). For each UG, leveraging the interference sparsity, we reveal that the performance of the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector can be guaranteed in the network mMIMO system by using the matched filtering (MF) outputs of the intra-group and interfering users. Then, with the base station (BS) connection sparsity, we reveal that the detection performance of each UG is primarily determined by a limited number of associated BSs. To facilitate practical application, we propose a straightforward user grouping method and outline the process for determining interfering users and associated BSs for each UG in UCN mMIMO systems. Then, we propose a user-centric detection method that decouples the detection process for each UG into two stages. In the first stage, local MF is performed at each associated BSs using local information. In the second stage, group-wise interference cancellation (IC) is carried out to obtain detection results at the primary serving BS (PSBS) of each UG, with information exchanged from auxiliary serving BSs (ASBSs). Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed user-centric detection for the UCN mMIMO system."

We describe the system’s design, characterization, and image reconstruction. Phantom experiments show that computational reconstruction using matched filtering (MF) significantly improves volumetric image quality over delay-and-sum (DAS), with spatial encoding enhancing lateral resolution at the cost of reduced contrast ratio. LSQR-based reconstruction was demonstrated to further improve resolution and suppress artifacts. Using both Hadamard and 16-angle plane wave transmission schemes, the system achieved high-resolution images with reasonable contrast, supporting the feasibility of 4D CA imaging applications."

First of all, we leverage LLM's internalized rich knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities to generate high-quality textual data using interactive querying. The textual data is then converted into low-dimensional, high-value features using FinBERT and Deep Sparse Autoencoder. Second, we employ Empirical Wavelet Transform to create stationary numerical series from the most strongly correlated features of raw material prices. Finally, by incorporating Feature-wise Attention Module, we use four deep learning models to extract local, bidirectional temporal, temporal, and global features. We conduct comparative experiments, ablation studies, significance tests, and robustness analyses on three real datasets from a leading lithium-ion battery manufacturer in China. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of EFD-CBGT."

    "abstract": "Image classification of rhizome plants plays a crucial role in supporting agriculture, the herbal industry, and biodiversity conservation. However, the high visual complexity-resulting from variations in shape, texture, and lighting conditions- presents significant challenges in the classification process. This study aims to optimize the accuracy of rhizome image classification by applying and comparing three feature selection methods: Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS), ReliefF, and L1-regularized Support Vector Machine (L1-SVM). The dataset comprises texture and shape features extracted from rhizome images using the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) technique and descriptive statistical analysis. Each feature selection method is integrated with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The experimental results demonstrate that the ReliefF method outperforms the others, achieving a test accuracy of 89% and an average AUC of 0.97, followed by L1-SVM and CFS. These findings confirm that appropriate feature selection significantly improves classification performance while reducing model complexity. This study offers practical insights into the selection of feature selection techniques for machine learning based plant image classification systems."

    "abstract": "Beidou common view time comparison is a commonly used method for achieving high-precision time-frequency comparison between stations, which can meet the user's demand for nanosecond level comparison accuracy. At present, the Beidou common view time comparison method uses code pseudo range observations for time difference calculation, and its accuracy is affected by the accuracy of code pseudo range observations. In addition, it requires post exchange of time difference data, which results in poor realtime performance. Based on this, It proposes a Beidou common view time comparison method based on PPP-B2b service. The method adopts a dual frequency ionosphere free combination model, and constructs observation equations using carrier phase observation and code pseudo range observation. After high-precision data processing such as carrier phase cycle slip detection and correction, error correction, parameter estimation, etc., a high-precision inter station comparison time difference can be calculated and obtained. By building an experimental platform, conducting remote high-precision time-frequency comparison experiment, and analyzing the experimental data, the analysis results show that this method not only meets the real-time needs of users, but also significantly improves the uncertainty of time measurement."

Together with the so-called artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), data-driven models are to be executed close to the data source. Nevertheless, one potential problem is the quality of the data used to feed these models. Data loss is a common issue in these systems and can hinder the use of monitoring data and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models. This paper evaluates a set of missing value imputation techniques, emphasizing their application in an edge setting. Specifically, offline and sliding window variants are evaluated to meet data availability and computational complexity criteria. The benchmarking has been performed using the data of a real IoT air quality monitoring platform. The results demonstrate that the windowed variants can approach the offline performance using reduced sliding windows of 25 to 100 samples per sensor."

The proposed approach determines the fitted state-space (FSS) model through the frequency-domain (FD) admittance matrix of the VSC, identified via the input-output responses of voltage and current at the point of connection (POC). By applying a multiple single-input single-output (SISO) vector fitting array, a stable FSS representation is determined with high accuracy. Order reduction methodologies such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Balanced Realization (BR) are then employed to generate the minimal representation of the VSC, eliminating redundant states and reducing computational burden. The presented approach is validated through pole analysis and comparison with electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations for a grid-following (GFL) converter. The effectiveness and applicability of the methodology are further demonstrated through a small-signal analysis of a test system based on the IEEE 9-bus benchmark, incorporating a black-box VSC model."

Specifically we applied ResNet50, MobileNetV3, DenseNet121, and VGG16 for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray and CT data. We developed a systematic preprocessing pipeline, including high pass filtering (HPF), Gaussian smoothing, normalization. To improve results, image augmentation methods were combined with advanced optimizers, including AdamW, adaptive learning rate, dropout, and batch normalization, and significant image augmentation techniques to address class balance and improvement in performance. The experimental findings indicate that on the balanced chest X-ray dataset, CNN+ResNet50 and CNN+DenseNet121 produced the highest accuracy with a perfect 98% while CNN+MobileNetV3 achieved the highest accuracy on the multimodal dataset (i.e., image modalities included MRI) with 96% accuracy. Further, a generative AI module was included to automatically generate structured diagnostic reports. This systematic non-analytical approach to increase the interpretability of the diagnosis and potentially improve clinical decision support was novel to this application. Overall the findings confirm that optimized hybrid deep learning frameworks and generative AI offered a reliable, accurate, and scalable approach to pneumonia diagnosis across different imaging modalities."

Then we examined the accuracy of their answers in identifying the highlighted target element under sedentary and walking conditions. Our results show that all three visual variables can be perceived with a medium to high accuracy rate, though performance varies depending on the mobility condition, the visual variable, and even the chart type. Among the visual variables, color and flicker yield the best target identification accuracy rates, while the area proves to be the least effective.

However, their reliance on large, attention-driven models makes them vulnerable to hardware-level attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel threat model referred to as Med-Hammer that combines the Rowhammer hardware fault injection with neural Trojan attacks to compromise the integrity of ViT-based medical imaging systems. Specifically, we demonstrate how malicious bit flips induced via Rowhammer can trigger implanted neural Trojans, leading to targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses (e.g., tumors or lesions) in medical scans. Through extensive experiments on benchmark medical imaging datasets such as ISIC, Braib Tumor, and MedMNIST, we show that such attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates about 82.51% and 92.56% in MobileViT and SwinTransformer, respectively. We further investigate how architectural properties, such as model sparsity, attention weight distribution, and number of features of the layer, impact attack effectiveness. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored intersection between hardware-level faults and deep learning security in healthcare applications, underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses spanning both model architectures and underlying hardware platforms."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the inter-temporal constraints of generation units necessitate real-time solutions to the AC multi-period optimal power flow (MP-OPF) problem. RES exhibit spatiotemporal correlations due to their geographically distributed nature and time-varying generation patterns. This paper proposes a novel graph recurrent neural networks (GRNN)-based approach to learn an optimization proxy for the AC MP-OPF problem. The proposed approach: (i) uses a graph attention mechanism to extract grid topology features, enhancing scalability for larger networks and improving topology adaptiveness; (ii) uses a recurrent structure to capture temporal correlations, and enable scalability for longer prediction horizons; and (iii) jointly consider spatial and temporal dependencies in end-to-end learning to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, a feasibility restoration layer minimizes constraint violations during training and ensures feasibility during testing. Numerical results on the IEEE 118-bus and PEGASE 1354-bus systems demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GRNN over the baseline neural architectures, achieving up to 50% lower prediction error, minor optimality gap of 0.5%, and 2-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups. Under N-1 line outages, the GRNN approach reduces the optimality gap by 4.5%, showcasing its robustness to topology changes. These results highlight the GRNN-FR as a promising approach for real-time applications in large-scale power networks, whether for fast warm-start initialization or rapid solution of numerous MP-OPF instances."

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduced by up to 96% across all axes. While the linearity of the sensor outputs remained consistently high before and after calibration, the calibration process effectively reduced both systematic and random errors. Additionally, temperature drift errors were effectively minimized, resulting in a sTABLE output over the tested temperature range of 17 °C-28 °C. The overall uncertainty of the calibration process, considering both field generation and measurement accuracy, is estimated to be within ±0.15%, ensuring the reliability of the proposed calibration method for high precision magnetic field measurements."

Conventional boost converter topologies, however, encounter limitations associated with extreme duty-cycle operation, elevated voltage stress on semiconductor devices, and deteriorated efficiency at higher gain conditions. To mitigate these challenges, this study proposes a high-gain DC-DC converter architecture founded on an active switched network (ASN). The configuration integrates coupled switched-inductor and switched-capacitor cells, enabling substantial voltage amplification under moderate duty ratios, thereby alleviating device stress and ensuring continuous input current characteristics. A comprehensive steady-state formulation in continuous conduction mode (CCM) is developed, followed by a systematic methodology for sizing both active and passive components. The dynamic performance is further assessed through the implementation of open-loop and closed-loop control schemes, validated via MATLAB/Simulink simulations, and subsequently verified on a 100 W hardware prototype. Comparative assessment against conventional and state-of-the-art converter structures demonstrates that the proposed ASN-based topology achieves a superior gain-to-component ratio along with enhanced efficiency, recording 86% under rated loading conditions. The outcomes establish the proposed converter as a viable candidate for renewable energy integration, fuel cell-powered systems, and distributed DC microgrid infrastructures."

To quantitatively evaluate agent performance, we validated system-generated recommendations against actual market movements across multiple Indonesian stocks within 30-day intervals. Result show that the Fundamental Agent achieved 75% directional accuracy, correctly identifying stock trends through indicators such as revenue growth, profit margin, and debt levels.

Caching them reduces computational overhead and latency when participating in multiple, semantically similar queries. This article proposes the Query Fragment Caching Algorithm (QFCA) for adaptive, dynamic caching of frequently accessed fragments. QFCA harmonizes advanced query parsing, semantic analysis, and intelligent fragment identification to achieve significant performance improvements.

This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a fractional delay filter based on the Farrow structure with a correlated tapped delay line (TDL) channel model, effectively resolving the trade-off between delay precision and hardware efficiency. The core motivation lies in constructing a highly accurate and scalable channel emulator to significantly reduce the reliance on noisy, time-consuming, and difficult-to-implement field tests. The framework adopts a three-stage optimization strategy: First, each multipath component is modeled using a Farrow filter to achieve high-precision delay simulation for individual paths. By optimizing the delay filters for each path, the number of filters is reduced by 80%. Next, the relative attenuation of each path and the Doppler power spectral density (PSD) conforming to the Jakes model are implemented. The Jakes model is optimized using the FFT method, which reduces computational complexity by over 10 times compared to direct time-domain superposition. Finally, the TDL-A to TDL-E channel model framework is realized using FIR filters in a time-varying filter system, lowering hardware complexity. Simulation results demonstrate precise modeling of TDL channels while reducing computational complexity and hardware implementation difficulty. This work provides practical guidance for designing low-cost, low-hardware-complexity channel emulators with guaranteed fidelity."

This paper proposes a cost-effective frequency selective surface (FSS) that functions as a narrow-band absorber, utilizing spherical water resonators within the unit cell as absorbing elements. A strong and sharp absorption resonance is achieved at 3.38 GHz for a unit cell size of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$15 \\times 15 \\text{mm}^{2}$</tex>. The surface demonstrates stability with respect to polarization, incidence angles up to 60°, and temperatures between 5° C and 45° C.

    "abstract": "Real-time and reliable wireless communication is increasingly vital for applications like remote robot control. To support such needs, radio environment maps (REMs) showing metrics like signal strength at each location in the area have gained attention. However, their values are affected by noise, fading, and positioning errors, so representing only the mean is insufficient; their full probability distribution is needed. While Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is commonly used to build REMs, it often struggles to capture distribution shapes and is inefficient at scale. To address these challenges, we build on Probabilistic Feature Networks using Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs), which utilize a transformer trained on GPR, and propose the Mixture of PFNs (MoPFNs) to model the probability distribution as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Experimental results in a 28 GHz millimeter wave (mmWave) environment show that the proposed method reduces the average error in estimated mean RSRP to less than 10 dB, accurately captures variations in distribution shape across locations, and improves execution time by approximately 92.5%."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence offer unprecedented flexibility in the delivery of rehabilitative services beyond clinic walls. This work introduces Smart Rehab, a skeletal-tracking platform that executes noise-resistant pose estimation for remote physiotherapy through a tandem of deep-learning models. Employing a compact, hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture, the framework monitors articulation across all major joints in real time, overlaying context-sensitive instructive prompts throughout prescribed rehabilitation. Comprehensive tests yield a mean-per-joint position error of 6.8 mm, a task-specific recognition accuracy of 96.7%, and sustained frame-wise processing of 28 ms, confirming the module’s capacity to reliability out-distance commercial gold standards. Comparative evaluation against lab-grade infrared motion sensors and biomechanical markers establishes equivalent fidelity, underlined by an operational expense less than one twentieth of present–day penal sensors while evading time-intense lab visits. By merging unmatched fidelity, clinical-grade dependability, and streamlined deployment management, Smart Rehab emerges as a compelling, extensible, and economically justifiable tele-rehabilitation platform, granting remote, real-time observation and adaptive case moderation by physiotherapy professionals, thereby preserving clinical trajectories in a context of fragmented portfolio care."

    "abstract": "Personalized Recommendation Systems (RS systems) have been gaining popularity among researchers in data science as the systems help users search for products that satisfy their preferences. Likewise, the systems also provide benefits to companies who desire their products to be known to more future customers. Although a wide ranges of methods and techniques have been proposed to boost RS systems performances recently, the significant contributions of this kind of systems are always needed in this information age when more e-commerce platforms are available. In this article, two groups of methods including (1) basic prediction methods and (2) vector-based similarity methods combined with KNN are compared in this study. In particular, the basic prediction method employed Min, Max and Average of the user's ratings to predict the missing values. On the other hand, the vector-based methods employed the combination of KNN and vector-based similarity including Pearson and Cosine to predict the missing ratings. The experiments were carried out using the datasets MovieLens 100 K. The evaluation metrics includes Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Cohen's Kappa metric (KAPPA), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to compared the performances of the models. The vector-based similarity using Pearson similarity combines with KNN provided better performance than the other models for the metrics including RMSE and MAE."

    "abstract": "Climate policy goals require massive expansion of renewable energy plants as well as transmission capacities and sector-coupling technologies. Although this requires a fundamental transformation, the energy system must be able to reliably supply future energy demand, especially for electricity and gas. In this context, Energy System Optimization Models (ESOMs) provide recommendations on future energy system designs. However, these models rely on deterministic assumptions about future developments. This reduces the robustness and validity of their findings in the context of uncertainty, especially with respect to future energy demands. To address this issue, Robust Optimization methods offer promising approaches to enhance the resilience of the optimized energy system designs by explicitly accounting for uncertainty in model inputs.In this context, this paper introduces an Adaptive Robust Optimization framework to consider uncertainty in future energy demands and applies it to a state-of-the art ESOM. The resulting model can be used to identify robust capacity expansions of generation and transmission infrastructures, that protect against the uncertainty across various scenarios."

    "abstract": "As electronic technologies continue to evolve, conventional arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs) are increasingly unable to meet the growing bandwidth demands. To address this limitation, interleaving architectures, including frequency-interleaved DAC (FI-DAC) and time-interleaved DAC (TI-DAC) have been proposed to improve the performance of AWG via multiple DACs. TI-DAC suffers from bandwidth constraints due to the magnitude roll-off characteristics of DAC. Therefore, the FI-DAC offer a more promising approach for bandwidth enhancement at the current DAC technology level. FI-DAC operate by decomposing and reconstructing signals in the frequency domain and require extensive use of analog components such as mixers and filters. However, the filters cannot fully suppress image components outside the passband of the sub-channel, leading to aliasing distortion in the reconstructed output signal. To address this issue, this paper develops a mathematical model of aliasing distortion and proposes a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based correction method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation results, confirming its potential to significantly reduce aliasing and improve output signal quality."

    "abstract": "The country requires a digital identification system that is reliable, secure, efficient, and resistant to forgery. Iris biometric systems offer a promising solution due to the unique and lifelong stable patterns of the iris, which are difficult to replicate. The use of deep learning technology has improved the accuracy of iris biometric systems, but often results in models with high computational demands. The knowledge distillation approach provides a solution by reducing model complexity without significantly compromising performance. This study utilizes DeepLabV3 as the teacher model and Lightweight U-Net as the student model for iris image segmentation. The evaluation focuses on segmentation performance using IoU, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, as well as model efficiency based on parameter count, model size, and inference time. The experimental results show that the student model achieves an IoU of 0.8823, precision of 0.9691, recall of 0.9078, and F1-score of 0.9374. Efficiency evaluation shows that the student model contains only 118,913 parameters, has a model size of 0.48 MB, and an inference time of 1.17 milliseconds. A comparison with the teacher model reveals that knowledge distillation reduces the number of parameters by 99.7 percent, the model size by 99.68 percent, and accelerates inference time by 50.21 percent. The reduction in segmentation accuracy is relatively small, with a 2.97 percent decrease in IoU, 0.41 percent in precision, 2.67 percent in recall, and 1.59 percent in F1-score. These findings confirm that knowledge distillation is an effective approach for producing lightweight and efficient segmentation models suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational resources."

    "abstract": "Automation and rigorous safety procedures have enabled commercial aviation organizations to operate with relatively low incident rates. Even so, the few incidents reported in 2024 continued to cite crew decision-making during the landing phase of flight as a contributory factor. Crew decisionmaking was also highlighted as a contributory factor in the Asiana 214 accident in 2013 that culminated in a crash following an unsafe and destabilized approach. This suggests that more needs to be done to support pilots in the landing phase of flight. The current work uses the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) framework to understand why pilots present during the Asiana 214 incident continued to land the aircraft in an unsafe and destabilized configuration. Interrogation of the information networks enabled the identification of design recommendations for a novel contextdependent energy support system. Such systems tailor the presentation of information based on the current operational environment and the state of the vehicle. The potential utility of this novel decision support system was then examined by integrating the design recommendations within the information network to explore its potential impact on the system."

Existing iterative solvers are commonly employed to handle the resulting sparse systems but suffer from slow convergence due to the ill-conditioned nature of the double-curl operator. Approximate preconditioners, like SOR and Incomplete LU decomposition (ILU) provide insufficient convergence, while direct solvers are impractical due to excessive memory requirements. To address this, we propose FlashMP, a novel preconditioning system that designs a subdomain exact solver based on discrete transforms. FlashMP provides an efficient GPU implementation that achieves multi-GPU scalability through domain decomposition.

    "abstract": "Power transformers are important in efficient transmission and distribution of electrical energy. Real-time monitoring and protection is necessary to make them last longer and avoid any unexpected failure. The paper will describe a smart transformer monitoring and protection system that was designed with the help of the Atmega328P microcontroller. The system connects several sensors in order to constantly monitor certain important parameters like temperature, voltage, and current. It can identify many kinds of faults such as line-to-line fault, line-to-ground fault, and double-line fault as well as overvoltage. A temperature sensor automatically turns on a cooling fan through a relay once safe thermal levels are surpassed and thus prevents overheating of the transformer. A current sensing module detects irregular current flow which can be an indication of overload or short circuit and a relay system is used to safely de-energies the transformer in the case of critical faults. On-site monitoring is presented by the display of all real-time information, e.g., fault types and sensors readings on an LCD display and sent in parallel to a cloud-based IoT system to be accessed remotely and provide alerts. This two-layer monitoring system improves the reliability of the system, reduces loss of time, and promotes proactive maintenance. The suggested system offers an affordable scalable solution that can be implemented in smart grid systems and rural and urban power systems."

Our approach dynamically modifies client workloads based on their failure history and integrates a lightweight backup mechanism to maintain aggregation continuity during edge server failures by backup servers handling.

    "abstract": "Very long-term load forecasts (VLTLFs) spanning 15 to 25 years are indispensable for strategic electricity infrastructure planning. These forecasts are even more challenging when the historical load data is scarce in addition to uncertain future load growth. This paper presents a methodology to generate seasonal peak load forecasts for grid supply points (GSPs) until 2050, despite having limited years of available recorded data. This is demonstrated with two real UK GSPs with 5 years of available data. First, macroeconomic and demographic variables (regional GDP and household statistics) are mined and interpolated to match seasonal resolution. A transfer-learning backcasting step employs ridge regression, which is compared and selected for its superior performance in reconstructing historical GSP loads. The exogenous variables are first forecasted using ARIMA, and the extended dataset then feeds into seasonal ARIMAX models to project future load peaks. Finally, projected additional demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps is incorporated based on DSO’s Distribution Future Energy Scenarios (DFES). For the first GSP considered, the 2035 and 2050 peak forecasts differ from DFES’ Electric Engagement scenario by 15% and 17%, respectively, while for the second one, the analogous differences are 12% and 8%. The methodology delivers robust, explainable VLTLFs with quantified uncertainty, demonstrating its suitability where load data availability is limited."
