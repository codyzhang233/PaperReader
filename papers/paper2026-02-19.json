    "abstract": "Research on backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models faces two key challenges: stealthiness and persistence. Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses."

    "abstract": "Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry."

These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions.

    "abstract": "In Video on Demand (VoD) scenarios, traditional codecs are the industry standard due to their high decoding efficiency. However, they suffer from severe quality degradation under low bandwidth conditions. While emerging generative neural codecs offer significantly higher perceptual quality, their reliance on heavy frame-by-frame generation makes real-time playback on mobile devices impractical. We ask: is it possible to combine the blazing-fast speed of traditional standards with the superior visual fidelity of neural approaches? We present HybridPrompt, the first generative-based video system capable of achieving real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on a commercial smartphone. Specifically, we employ a hybrid architecture that encodes Keyframes using a generative model while relying on traditional codecs for the remaining frames. A major challenge is that the two paradigms have conflicting objectives: the \"hallucinated\" details from generative models often misalign with the rigid prediction mechanisms of traditional codecs, causing bitrate inefficiency. To address this, we demonstrate that the traditional decoding process is differentiable, enabling an end-to-end optimization loop. This allows us to use subsequent frames as additional supervision, forcing the generative model to synthesize keyframes that are not only perceptually high-fidelity but also mathematically optimal references for the traditional codec. By integrating a two-stage generation strategy, our system outperforms pure neural baselines by orders of magnitude in speed while achieving an average LPIPS gain of 8% over traditional codecs at 200kbps."

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots."

Recent studies demonstrate that carefully designed multi-agent workflows and communication graphs can significantly improve code generation performance by leveraging collaborative reasoning. However, existing methods neither adapt topology density to task difficulty nor iteratively refine the topology within an instance using execution feedback, which leads to redundant communication and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose AgentConductor: a reinforcement learning-optimized MAS with an LLM-based orchestrator agent as its core, which enables end-to-end feedback-driven dynamic generation of interaction topologies. For each query, AgentConductor infers agent roles and task difficulty, then constructs a task-adapted, density-aware layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology, underpinned by two key innovations. First, we design a novel topological density function that captures communication-aware mathematical characterizations of multi-agent interactions. Second, we adopt difficulty interval partitioning to avoid excessive pruning for precise topological density upper bound measurement per difficulty level and finer-grained control. Empirically, across three competition-level and two foundational code datasets, AgentConductor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 14.6% in pass@1 accuracy, 13% in density reduction, and 68% in token cost reduction."

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$."

No prior work has explored methods to help reviewers efficiently identify code that will be removed.In this paper, we propose a prediction model that identifies functions likely to be deleted during PR review.

    "abstract": "The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the \"Right to be Forgotten\" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning."

We find streaming is enhanced when $C_s>1$, suppressed for $0\\leq C_s\\leq1$, and reversed when $C_s<0$. We explain the regimes in terms of the interplay between the Reynolds and viscoelastic stresses that collectively drive fluid motion. Remarkably, we discover the role of viscoelastic shear waves in acoustic streaming transition characterized by the ratio of acoustic attenuation length and shear wavelength. We gain deeper insight into the streaming transition by examining energy dynamics in terms of the loss and storage moduli. Our study may find applications in acousto-microfluidics systems for particle handling and fluid pumping/mixing."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress in recent years, but most algorithms still rely on a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed decision intervals. This formulation is often ill-suited for complex multi-agent dynamics, particularly in high-frequency or irregular time-interval settings, leading to degraded performance and motivating the development of continuous-time MARL (CT-MARL). Existing CT-MARL methods are mainly built on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. However, they rarely account for safety constraints such as collision penalties, since these introduce discontinuities that make HJB-based learning difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a continuous-time constrained MDP (CT-CMDP) formulation and a novel MARL framework that transforms discrete MDPs into CT-CMDPs via an epigraph-based reformulation. We then solve this by proposing a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based actor-critic method that enables stable and efficient optimization in continuous time. We evaluate our approach on continuous-time safe multi-particle environments (MPE) and safe multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks. Results demonstrate smoother value approximations, more stable training, and improved performance over safe MARL baselines, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our method."

Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps.

Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity."

Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch.

    "abstract": "Population-adjusted indirect comparisons (PAICs) are widely used to synthesize evidence when randomized controlled trials enroll different patient populations and head-to-head comparisons are unavailable. Although PAICs adjust for observed population differences across trials, adjustment alone does not ensure transportability of estimated effects to decision-relevant populations for health technology assessment (HTA). We examine and formalize transportability in PAICs from an estimand-based perspective. We distinguish conditional and marginal treatment effect estimands and show how transportability depends on effect modification, collapsibility, and alignment between the scale of effect modification and the effect measure. Using illustrative examples, we demonstrate that even when effect modifiers are shared across treatments, marginal effects are generally population-dependent for commonly used non-collapsible measures, including hazard ratios and odds ratios. Conversely, collapsible and conditional effects defined on the linear predictor scale exhibit more favorable transportability properties. We further show that pairwise PAIC approaches typically identify effects defined in the comparator population and that applying these estimates to other populations entails an additional, often implicit, transport step requiring further assumptions. This has direct implications for HTA, where PAIC-derived effects are routinely applied within cost-effectiveness and decision models defined for different target populations. Our results clarify when applying PAIC-derived treatment effects to desired target populations is justified, when doing so requires additional assumptions, and when results should instead be interpreted as population-specific rather than decision-relevant, supporting more transparent and principled use of indirect evidence in HTA and related decision-making contexts."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \\emph{single} policy network, causing \\emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE."

While current exercise recommendation frameworks have made significant strides, they frequently encounter obstacles regarding the long-tailed distribution of student engagement and the failure to adapt to idiosyncratic learning trajectories. We present LiveGraph, a novel active-structure neural re-ranking framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach utilizes a graph-based representation enhancement strategy to bridge the information gap between active and inactive students while integrating a dynamic re-ranking mechanism to foster content diversity. By prioritizing the structural relationships within learning histories, the proposed model effectively balances recommendation precision with pedagogical variety. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that LiveGraph surpasses contemporary baselines in both predictive accuracy and the breadth of exercise diversity."

Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team."

    "abstract": "Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups."

    "abstract": "Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with tool integration achieve strong performance on fixed task-oriented dialogue datasets but remain vulnerable to unanticipated, user-induced errors. Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory, user scheduling, and time-slot duration in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems under minimum expected spectral efficiency (SE) constraints. Unlike most existing studies that approximate the expected SE by substituting the random channel gain with its mean value, thereby evaluating the SE at the average channel realization and overestimating the true expected SE due to Jensen's inequality, we approximate the expected SE by numerically integrating the SE over the channel distributions. Specifically, instead of relying on average-channel-based approximations, we develop a conservative yet tractable quadrature-based approximation by discretizing the associated cumulative distribution functions. The resulting finite-sum representation explicitly accounts for the probabilistic LoS structure and channel fading effects, while remaining tractable for optimization. Leveraging this lower bound, we formulate a mission completion time minimization problem subject to minimum expected-SE requirements for all ground nodes. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, which is tackled via a penalty-based block coordinate descent framework. The proposed algorithm alternately optimizes the scheduling decisions and the UAV trajectory along with adaptive time-slot durations, and maintains feasibility with respect to the original expected-SE constraints by leveraging successive convex approximation and quadratic transform techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method strictly satisfies the minimum expected-SE constraints and achieves a significantly shorter mission completion time than conventional average-channel-based approaches, which are shown to yield infeasible or overly conservative solutions."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "In his late piece 'La nouvelle cuisine' (Bell 1990), John Bell describes the steps from an intuitive, informal principle of locality to a mathematical rule called Factorizability. This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias."

    "abstract": "Object-oriented programs tend to be written using many common coding idioms, such as those captured by design patterns. While design patterns are useful, implementing them is often tedious and repetitive, requiring boilerplate code that distracts the programmer from more essential details. In this paper, we introduce Mason, a tool that synthesizes object-oriented programs from partial program pieces, and we apply it to automatically insert design patterns into programs. At the core of Mason is a novel technique we call type- and name-guided synthesis, in which an enumerative solver traverses a partial program to generate typing constraints; discharges constraints via program transformations guided by the names of constrained types and members; and backtracks when a constraint is violated or a candidate program fails unit tests. We also introduce two extensions to Mason: a non-local backtracking heuristic that uses execution traces, and a language of patterns that impose syntactic restrictions on missing names. We evaluate Mason on a suite of benchmarks to which Mason must add various well-known design patterns implemented as a library of program pieces. We find that Mason performs well when very few candidate programs satisfy its typing constraints and that our extensions can improve Mason's performance significantly when this is not the case. We believe that Mason takes an important step forward in synthesizing multi-class object-oriented programs using design patterns."

We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation."

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."

We contrast low $Re$ undulatory propulsion ($\\text{Un} > 1$), exemplified by freshwater snails, with high $Re$ flapping propulsion ($\\text{Un} < 1$), seen in bats and bees. For snails, we derive lubrication models showing that pumping and swimming speeds scale with $(a/h_0)^2$, a result validated by robotic experiments which also reveal the detrimental effects of surface deformation (high Capillary/Bond ratio). Conversely, for high $Re$ fliers, we examine the ground effect's role in lift enhancement. Biological data from bats (\\textit{R. ferrumequinum}) reveal a 2.5-fold increase in lift coefficient during surface-skimming drinking flights, attributed to aerodynamic squeezing effects. Finally, we analyze honeybee fanning, demonstrating how a \"jet-vortex\" mechanism utilizes ground effect to transport pheromones efficiently against diffusion. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding fluid-structure interactions near boundaries in biological systems."

We find the field's evolution depends critically on the product of its amplitude and squared wavenumber, revealing a massless regime at large values and an ultra-massive regime with dominant nonlinear Fourier mode mixing near unity. By comparing the resulting dispersion map to the massive Klein-Gordon equation, we introduce a spectral mass. We demonstrate that a specific input amplitude value induces a spectral mass of unity, effectively characterizing the massive-like behavior arising from the initial wave configuration."

In this study, we conducted a causal mediation analysis to decompose the total effect of daily temperature on respiratory ED visits in Los Angeles from 2005 to 2016. We focused on ambient ozone as a mediator because its precursors and formation are directly driven by sunlight and temperature. We estimated natural direct, indirect, and total effects on the relative risk scale across deciles of temperature exposure compared to the median. We utilized Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to flexibly characterize the nonlinear relationship between temperature and ozone and quantified uncertainty via posterior prediction and the Bayesian bootstrap. Our results showed that ozone partially mediated the association between high temperatures and respiratory ED visits, particularly at moderately high temperatures. We also validated our modeling approach through simulation studies. This study extends the existing literature by considering acute respiratory morbidity and employing a flexible modeling approach, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying temperature-related health risks."

When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces."

We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases."

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding efficiency relies on coordinated tongue motion, sustained tissue contact and maintenance of an effective intraoral seal. Current assessments of seal formation mainly use local kinematic descriptors or pressure recordings, which do not capture the global structural continuity of the sealing region. We introduce a systolic geometry based approach in which each sagittal ultrasound frame is modeled as a two dimensional deformable domain bounded by tongue, palate and nipple contours. Global seal continuity is formalized through the shortest closed curve that cannot be contracted to a point because of the overall geometry of the domain. The nipple defines a central region that must be circumferentially enclosed by a contact band to maintain suction. Within this band, closed curves encircling the nipple exactly once can be identified; the shortest of these curves defines a normalized systolic index representing the tightest admissible sealing loop. Simulations of symmetric thinning, localized discontinuities and cyclic perturbations reveal feasibility boundaries separating seal preserving from seal breaking configurations. Notably, admissible encircling curves may transiently disappear even when overall geometric motion remains smooth. By capturing global circumferential continuity that cannot be inferred from local metrics alone, our approach generates testable hypotheses linking the existence and temporal stability of admissible encircling curves to milk transfer efficiency and vacuum stability. Applied to segmented ultrasound data and integrated with pressure measurements, our systolic approach could provide a quantitative framework for objective assessment of seal integrity and longitudinal monitoring of latch stability."

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches."

The key feature of the proposed method is a bound on the uncertainty propagation along the prediction horizon which exploits a set-theoretic over-approximation of each term of the uncertain system impulse response. Such an approximation is based on matrix zonotopes and leverages the interval matrix structure of the uncertainty model. Its main advantage is that all the relevant bounds are computed offline, thus making the online computational load independent of the number of uncertain parameters. A variable-horizon MPC formulation is adopted to guarantee recursive feasibility and to ensure robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to match the feasibility regions of the most effective state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing the computational burden, thereby enabling the treatment of nontrivial dimensional systems with multiple uncertain parameters."

    "abstract": "We cast episodic Markov decision process (MDP) planning as Bayesian inference over _policies_. A policy is treated as the latent variable and is assigned an unnormalized probability of optimality that is monotone in its expected return, yielding a posterior distribution whose modes coincide with return-maximizing solutions while posterior dispersion represents uncertainty over optimal behavior. To approximate this posterior in discrete domains, we adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to inference over deterministic policies under stochastic dynamics, introducing a sweep that enforces policy consistency across revisited states and couples transition randomness across particles to avoid confounding from simulator noise. Acting is performed by posterior predictive sampling, which induces a stochastic control policy through a Thompson-sampling interpretation rather than entropy regularization. Across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising, we analyze the structure of inferred policy distributions and compare the resulting behavior to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, highlighting qualitative and statistical differences that arise from policy-level uncertainty."

Specifically, we consider functionals featuring bulk terms depending on the symmetrized gradient of the displacement and terms comparable to the surface area of the material voids inside the material. Under suitable growth conditions for the bulk and surface densities we prove that, as the microscale $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero, the $Γ$-limit admits an integral representation that contains an additional surface term expressed by jump discontinuities of the displacement outside of the void region. This term is related to the phenomenon of collapsing of voids in the effective limit. Under a continuity assumption of the surface density at the $\\varepsilon$-scale, we show that the limiting density related to jumps is twice the energy density for voids."

Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as \"forest\". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable."

This provides a geometric means for obtaining associative algebras -- conjecturally all -- which are derived equivalent to skew-gentle algebras. We include a new perspective on the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold disk which serves as a local model for the Fukaya categories of general orbifold surfaces. This perspective yields an equivalence between the perfect derived category of a quiver of type $\\mathrm D_{n+1}$ and the perfect derived category of a graded quiver of type $\\widetilde{\\mathrm A}_{n-1}$, the latter being equipped with quadratic zero relations and a nontrivial A$_\\infty$ structure.

We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths.

    "abstract": "In a decentralized balancing model, Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) are encouraged by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to deviate from their schedule to help the system restore balance, also referred to as implicit balancing. This could reduce balancing costs for the grid operator and lower the entry barrier for flexible assets compared to explicit balancing services. However, these implicit reactions may overshoot when their total capacity is high, potentially requiring more explicit activations. This study analyses the effect of increased participation in the decentralized balancing model in Belgium. To this end, we develop a market simulator that produces price signals on minute-level and simulate the implicit reactions for battery assets with different risk profiles. Besides the current price formula, we also study two potential candidates for the near-term presented by the TSO. A simulation study is conducted using Belgian market data for the year 2023. The findings indicate that, while having a significant positive effect on the balancing costs at first, the risk of overshoots can outweigh the potential benefits when the total capacity of the implicit reactions becomes too large. Furthermore, even when the balancing costs start to increase for the TSO, BRPs were still found to benefit from implicit balancing."

The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges."

The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors."

In this paper we develop the theory of symmetric extensions including different types of iterations, quotients, equivalents, and the structural results that can be described in this language. In particular, we give a modern exposition to some of the important theorems of Grigorieff [3], study Kinna--Wagner Principles in symmetric extensions, and show that it is provable from $\\mathsf{ZF}$ that every set lies in a symmetric extension of $\\operatorname{HOD}$."

While teleportation from CV to DV can be achieved with near-unit success probability, the reverse process is usually limited to a maximum success probability of $1/2$. We demonstrate that, by employing cross-Kerr nonlinearity together with passive linear optical components such as polarizing beam splitters, beam splitters, and phase shifters, almost perfect teleportation from DV to CV encodings can also be achieved."

    "abstract": "Modern neural translation models based on the Transformer architecture are known for their high performance, particularly when trained on high-resource datasets. A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization."

When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $Γ$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish."

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness.

The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia.

To enable scalable evaluation, recent work increasingly relies on third-party annotations of static dialogue logs by crowd workers or large language models. However, the reliability of this practice remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the reliability and structure of user-centric CRS evaluation on static dialogue transcripts. We collected 1,053 annotations from 124 crowd workers on 200 ReDial dialogues using the 18-dimensional CRS-Que framework. Using random-effects reliability models and correlation analysis, we quantify the stability of individual dimensions and their interdependencies. Our results show that utilitarian and outcome-oriented dimensions such as accuracy, usefulness, and satisfaction achieve moderate reliability under aggregation, whereas socially grounded constructs such as humanness and rapport are substantially less reliable. Furthermore, many dimensions collapse into a single global quality signal, revealing a strong halo effect in third-party judgments. These findings challenge the validity of single-annotator and LLM-based evaluation protocols and motivate the need for multi-rater aggregation and dimension reduction in offline CRS evaluation."

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs."

Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted. Numerical results show that the per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance, while the compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with a short pilot and can outperform baselines that require much longer pilots."

    "abstract": "Spectrum is an important numerical invariant of an isolated hypersurface singularity, connecting its topological and analytic structures. The well-known Hertling conjecture tells the relation of range and variance of exponents i.e. elements of spectrum. For trimodal singularities, we compute their spectra and verify Hertling conjecture for them. Jung, Kim, Saito and Yoon recently defined Tjurina spectrum, stemming from Hodge ideals. This set of numerical invariants is a subset of spectrum in Steenbrink's sense. We give an estimation of exponents not in Tjurina spectrum and propose a similar Generalized Hertling Conjecture for Tjurina Spectrum. Moreover, we prove the conjecture for singularities of modality $\\leq 3$."

    "abstract": "Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."

We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline."

Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_π\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $Dπ$ two-body subsystems.

    "abstract": "Since its introduction in the early 90s, the web has become the largest application platform available globally. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development."

As a result, its interaction with a matter particle, such as the nucleon or a heavy-light meson, such as the $D$ meson, is completely determined by chiral dynamics and much stronger than its pion cousin. The strong attractive interaction has brought us many surprises and is manifested in the peculiar nature of many particles, such as the mysterious $Λ(1405)$ and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. These two particles can be understood as $\\bar{K}N$ and $DK$ hadronic molecules, respectively. They also imply the existence of three-body hadronic molecules that await future discovery.

Our work is inspired by Talagrand's convolution conjecture in the discrete cube setting, as well as by subsequent developments on the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the Lévy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators. The results are illustrated by numerous examples demonstrating that the $L^1$-regularizing effects become stronger as $t \\uparrow \\infty$."

Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \\emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy."

Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average."

In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification."

Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact."

We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines.

We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Milićević (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \\emph{near-pencil} configuration.

To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations.

Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier."

In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation."

    "abstract": "While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas."

    "abstract": "Emerging IoT applications are transitioning from battery-powered to grid-powered nodes. DRP, a contention-based data dissemination protocol, was developed for these applications. Traditional contention-based protocols resolve collisions through control packet exchanges, significantly reducing goodput. DRP mitigates this issue by employing a distributed delay timer mechanism that assigns transmission-start delays based on the average link quality between a sender and its children, prioritizing highly connected nodes for early transmission. However, our in-field experiments reveal that DRP is unable to accommodate real-world link quality fluctuations, leading to overlapping transmissions from multiple senders. This overlap triggers CSMA's random back-off delays, ultimately degrading the goodput performance. To address these shortcomings, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that characterizes the design requirements induced by real-world link quality fluctuations and DRP's passive acknowledgments. Guided by this analysis, we design EDRP, which integrates two novel components: (i) Link-Quality Aware CSMA (LQ-CSMA) and (ii) a Machine Learning-based Block Size Selection (ML-BSS) algorithm for rateless codes. LQ-CSMA dynamically restricts the back-off delay range based on real-time link quality estimates, ensuring that nodes with stronger connectivity experience shorter delays. ML-BSS algorithm predicts future link quality conditions and optimally adjusts the block size for rateless coding, reducing overhead and enhancing goodput. In-field evaluations of EDRP demonstrate an average goodput improvement of 39.43\\% than the competing protocols."

    "abstract": "While ground-state preparation is expected to be a primary application of quantum computers, it is also an essential subroutine for many fault-tolerant algorithms. In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures."

Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads. This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community. DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O."

Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment."

In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension."

This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance."

Empirically, on a synthetic Moons dataset and on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, we measure pairwise energy gaps via Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) and find that wider networks exhibit smaller gaps; in particular, a permutation test on the maximum gap yields $p_{perm}=0$, indicating a clear reduction in the barrier height."

    "abstract": "The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity."

In the ultralight regime, the enormous occupation number of the dark matter field motivates a classical description in terms of a coherently oscillating background, leading to distinctive, time-dependent signatures in laboratory observables. We discuss the effective field theory framework governing ALP interactions with Standard Model fields, and show how different operators give rise to qualitatively different experimental signals. The lecture notes cover both conversion-based searches enabled by the axion-photon coupling, such as haloscopes and helioscopes, and precision experiments sensitive to oscillations of fundamental constants and material properties. These include atomic and nuclear clocks, optical cavities, laser and unequal time-delay interferometers, and mechanical or solid state resonators. Emphasis is placed on the physical origin of the sensitivity of each platform, the role of coherence, bandwidth, and noise, and the complementarity between different technologies across a wide range of ALP masses. Together, these approaches provide broad and overlapping coverage of ultralight dark matter parameter space and define a rapidly evolving experimental programme with strong discovery potential."

The full RMM encodes detailed pairwise correlations among jets, b-jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse energy but contains more than a thousand values per event, making it computationally heavy for large-scale training and incompatible with current low-qubit quantum devices. The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks. Their compactness, stability, and physics transparency also make them naturally compatible with near-term quantum machine learning architectures. RMM-C46 provides a scalable, efficient, and quantum-ready alternative to the full RMM for next-generation collider physics analyses."

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts. Our work establishes a principled new view of activation steering in LLM alignment by unifying its theoretical foundations via ODEs, and validating it empirically through the proposed ODESteer method."

Existing optimisation- and learning-based schemes often assume access to fine-grained traffic traces and lack a structured mechanism for translating coarse operational measurements into deployable hibernation policies with explicit trade-off calibration. To address these limitations, this paper proposes <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">HDTwin-E5G</i>, a hybrid digital-twin (DT) framework that integrates traffic data regeneration, prediction, optimisation-driven feasibility filtering, and reinforcement-learning (RL) refinement for energy-aware BS control. The framework first reconstructs minute-level traffic profiles from hourly measurements using a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) regeneration module with smoothing, thereby enabling stable short-horizon forecasting. It then employs an MDP-based decision stage and a stochastic constraint-aware optimizer to ensure SLA compliance, followed by a DT-validated Double DQN agent that refines feasible actions through an energy-saving ratio (ESR)–shaped reward. Importantly, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">HDTwin-E5G</i> introduces a DT-first reward-weight tuning procedure to select Pareto-efficient trade-offs and derive deployable presets across traffic regimes. Experimental evaluations across representative urban-dense and suburban deployments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 28.7% and 33.1% ESR, respectively, while maintaining stable latency (approximately 42 ms and 39 ms), highlighting the effectiveness of combining data regeneration with DT-guided hybrid control for practical, QoS-aware energy savings in 5G networks."

Existing detectors typically exhibit a high miss rate under these challenging conditions. We present RSTR (Remote Sensing Detection Transformer), a transformer-based framework optimized for tiny-object detection in complex backgrounds. Specifically, we introduce a novel cross-attention multi-scale feature pyramid network (CMFPN) that captures cross-scale interactions and fuses high-level semantics with low-level details to strengthen representations of minute targets. A deformable patch-wise attention (DPA) module links global context and local detail to increase attention to tiny objects across channels and spatial positions, improving detectability. A lightweight FocusBlock accelerates inference while preserving cues for tiny targets and maintaining a small parameter budget, achieving a favorable speed-accuracy trade-off. We further design FMIoU, a loss function that improves learning from low-confidence predictions and reduces false positives and missed detections for tiny objects. Relative to comparable baselines, RSTR reduces the number of parameters by 39.8% and computation by 16.2%, indicating a stronger accuracy-efficiency balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTR achieves AP50 scores of 51.3%, 58.8%, and 78.0% on the VisDrone, AI-TOD, and DIOR datasets, respectively. RSTR also yields substantial gains over the RT-DETR baseline and other detectors on tiny-object benchmarks, providing an effective solution for tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery."

    "abstract": "Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.

    "abstract": "In emergency rescue scenarios, air-to-ground (A2G) integrated mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) face challenges such as dynamic topology, limited resources, and unstable communication opportunities. To address these issues, we propose a position-probability-resource cooperative routing (PP-RCR) algorithm. First, Kalman filtering is applied to predict the future positions of nodes and accurately identify effective communication opportunities, which can mitigate link disruptions caused by topology dynamics. Then, a multi-dimensional relay selection criterion is designed by considering the transmission reliability, node resources, and message attributes, enabling adaptive relay selection among heterogeneous nodes. Based on this, a dynamic message replication and deletion strategy is introduced according to the urgency of messages, and the transmission path is optimized. Finally, the simulation results show that, in typical rescue scenarios, the proposed PP-RCR algorithm achieves higher delivery ratio and lower average delivery delay compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."

In nuclear microelectronics, these circuits are characterized by stringent requirements in terms of equivalent noise charge <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(ENC)</i>, and maximum input charge specification, which is tied to the voltage output swing capability of the amplifier itself. The need for periodic or continuous discharge of the feedback capacitance further constrains the design choices. In this work, a circuital solution that acts on the feedback discharge path to optimize the quiescent operating point of the CSA is presented, allowing an increase in the effective dynamic range of the CSA without affecting the spectroscopic resolution of the system. In addition, the proposed reset architecture allows to use a single power supply, avoiding the double supply generally used to increase the dynamic range, gaining in system compactness. Experimental measurements show an increase of +107% in the dynamic range with respect to standard reset architectures of state-of-the-art CSAs for low-capacitance (≤ 0.1 pF) semiconductor radiation detectors, achieving a total maximum input charge of ≃3×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup> el.

However, HE is still slow and uses a significant amount of memory, especially due to complex operations such as multiplying encrypted data. These operations rely on polynomial arithmetic, which involves modular arithmetic operations, including additions, subtractions, and multiplications. Among these, integer modular multiplication is the most challenging to implement. In this work, we focus on improving the whole process of Barrett Modular Multiplication (BMM), which includes multiplying two numbers and reducing the result. We examine various methods to enhance the key steps of BMM: multiplication, estimating the quotient, reducing the result, and handling overflows. We test these methods in hardware and compare them based on their speed and efficiency, using area-time-performance (ATP) and throughput-per-second (TPS) metrics."

    "abstract": "The field of 3D printing has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, leading to its widespread adoption across diverse industrial sectors. Among the various additive manufacturing technologies, Digital Light Processing (DLP) stands out for its high resolution, fast printing speed, and material versatility. Despite these advantages, the use of photopolymer resin in DLP often results in unwanted surface residues on printed parts, causing tackiness and a loss of structural integrity. To mitigate these drawbacks, post-processing steps such as washing, drying, and curing are essential. However, these procedures are typically carried out manually, which introduces variability and makes it difficult to maintain consistent product quality. Ensuring uniformity requires the minimization of human intervention through process automation, along with precise control tailored to the specific characteristics of each printed component. This study presents an automated post-processing system capable of dynamically adjusting washing parameters according to the type of printed object. By integrating intelligent control into the washing stage, the proposed system improves the consistency and overall reliability of DLP-based 3D printed products."

Specifically, multibeam low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication is emerging as a key solution to providing high-capacity, wide-area coverage to remote regions such as oceans, mountains, and deserts. In this paper, an opportunistic resource scheduling scheme is analyzed to efficiently utilize LEO satellite resources. An opportunistic resource scheduling algorithm is proposed that optimally allocates and schedules based on the time-varying channel conditions of each user. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is designed to maximize total average capacity while satisfying the minimum capacity requirement for each user, thereby ensuring user-specific quality of service (QoS). An algorithm utilizing a Lagrangian dual approach was developed to find the optimal beam allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves capacity convergence while satisfying the QoS requirements of all users."

To address this challenge of model adaptation in a data privacy-aware setting, we introduce Federated MDA Through Optimal Transport (FMDA-OT), a novel framework consisting of two key phases. In the first phase, each source domain is independently adapted to the target domain using an Optimal Transport (OT) method. In the second phase, a centralized collaborative Federated Learning (FL) architecture is used, which aggregates the N models from the N sources without accessing their data, thus taking privacy into consideration. During this process, the server leverages a small, target-domain side pseudo-labeled validation subset, to refine and guide the adaptation, as well as ensuring an unsupervised learning-driven approach. This dual-phase design seeks to improve target model performance on the target domain data while keeping source data local in a privacy-aware federated setting.

Thus, lipreading methods based on visual signals can be used in noisy environments or as a communication aid for individuals with hearing impairments, becoming another viable option. However, lipreading models usually involve high computational complexity, making their real-time deployment on resourceconstrained embedded devices challenging. This study proposes a Mandarin lipreading recognition model and deploys it on an edge computing platform equipped with a commercially available AI accelerator evaluating the inference performance and latency in real-world scenarios. The model is trained on the DMCLR Mandarin lipreading dataset and uses a lightweight architecture design, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental platform utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 and is tested with either a Google Coral Edge TPU or a Hailo-8 accelerator. The study compares the differences between the two accelerators in terms of inference speed, accuracy, and temporal task processing capabilities and analyzes their limitations. The results show that both accelerators can support real-time inference, with Hailo-8 exhibiting lower latency and higher accuracy, although model conversion and deployment are more complex. This study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a lipreading recognition model on edge devices and provides practical insights into the selection of accelerators."

    "abstract": "The necessity for extremely dependable and secure computational infrastructures that can manage large data processing workloads has increased due to the development of cloud-based supercomputing. However, current fault-tolerant systems frequently fail to maintain performance consistency under complicated fault conditions and are not resilient against cyber-attacks at the quantum level. In order to tackle this issue, the research presents a Quantum-Cryptography Embedded Fault-Tolerant Algorithm (QCE-FTA) that incorporates quantum error correction and quantum key distribution (QKD) into the work scheduling and checkpointing layers of cloud supercomputing systems. Without sacrificing processing speed, QCE-FTA guarantees encrypted data transfer, dynamic fault recovery, and secure key exchange. When compared to conventional techniques, experimental simulations conducted on hybrid cloud settings show notable gains in task recovery efficiency, encryption strength, and system stability. According to the results, QCE-FTA offers a scalable, quantum-resilient framework that guarantees data integrity and business continuity for upcoming high-performance cloud infrastructures."

    "abstract": "This research focuses on detecting depression from text based on machine learning algorithms. Depression is a mood disorder that negatively affects one's well-being. With the increase in depression cases worldwide, this research aims to develop an efficient method of detecting depression symptoms based on the words people post on social media. The research uses a dataset of raw text that involves cleaning phases, tokenization, and vectorization. Six machine learning algorithms are used to compare the performance of the algorithms in symptom detection of depression. They are Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. The result of the research is used for comparison of the accuracy and efficiency levels of each of the algorithms. Experiment outcomes indicate that the Support Vector Machine model achieves the best result, with 0.910 accuracy, establishing its capability for detecting depression.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation (CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code representations; however, discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained motion details, limiting expressiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a method that augments pose code–based latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This approach preserves the interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and yields a slight improvement in Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510. Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes further demonstrates the model’s controllability for motion editing."

    "abstract": "This research paper explores the intersections between AI-based simulation and digital twin technologies to make intelligent business plans in intelligent business predictive maintenance, process optimization, and decision-making. The concept of a digital twin is developed on four machine learning models, namely- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and gradual Boosting Machine (GBM) trained on a data set consisting of real-time and historical data of IoT connected industrial equipment such as CNC milling machines. The data include sensor measurements, SCADA data, maintenance data, manufacturing statistics, and environmental data, which are exposed to preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction, missing value filling, normalizing and feature engineering. The models are analysed based on their performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2. ANN is the best of the other models with most predictive reliability and accuracy and has highest operations cost saving (22.7) and energy savings (25.6). GBM comes second as it is dependent on boosting mechanisms to make better predictions. RF has the most favorable trade-off between level of accuracy and efficiency. SVM has the worst performance since it is very sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and non-linearity. The findings determine the capabilities of AI-based digital twins to minimize downtime, decrease maintenance costs, and improve industrial processes. The analysis reveals that ANN can be the most suitable model of predictive analytics and business intelligence that are provided in real-time and, therefore, AI-based digital twins are the valuable instrument of industrial automation in the future. The next round of research might explore the field of hybrid AI methods to improve predictive capability and efficiency in smart manufacturing and optimization of business processes."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of digital learning and the proliferation of e-learning platforms, accurately assessing student engagement has become an essential challenge. However, most existing studies lack the ability to capture global features, making it difficult for deep learning (DL) models to learn the relationships between local features, which in turn limits the effectiveness of feature representation. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a vision transformer (ViT) that incorporates Hyena module for student engagement recognition. The Hyena module not only can capture long-range dependencies (LRD) within images, but also possesses the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These advantages enable the DL model to converge stably on a limited database and effectively enhance its feature representation capability. According to the experimental results, the method proposed by this paper achieved a recall of 83.05 %, a precision of 84.15 %, and an F1-score 83.58 % on the SVD-OL database."

Traditional English learning platforms often rely on single-modal data and lack adaptive learning path optimization, which limits their effectiveness in addressing diverse learner needs. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multimodal knowledge tracing with reinforcement learning to build an intelligent English learning system. The proposed method fuses textual, audio, and behavioral data through attention mechanisms, employs a deep knowledge tracing network enhanced with knowledge graph embeddings to model learners' evolving knowledge states, and utilizes deep reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize personalized learning paths dynamically. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark educational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance with AUC of 0.86 and ACC of 0.84, significantly outperforming five baseline methods including traditional machine learning approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The results validate the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and reinforcement learning-based path optimization in enhancing learning outcomes."

This study investigates the protection and inheritance strategies for the Jin-style filigree mosaic art, an ICH, in the digital era, addressing the challenges of cultural identity in a rapidly evolving social context. Grounded in schema theory and integrating digital and artificial intelligence technologies, the study devises specific methods for safeguarding and perpetuating this art form. The research team initially examined the historical background, artistic features, and current state of inheritance of the Jin-style filigree mosaic art. Subsequently, they crafted VR/AR encoding plans and validated their efficacy through experimental trials. By surveying 1,138 students from art schools and amassing data on their satisfaction with VR/AR-based science education, the study performed statistical analyses. The findings revealed that VR/AR technology markedly enhanced students’ overall satisfaction and self-efficacy, thereby furnishing empirical evidence for the digital preservation and living inheritance of ICH skills. This research not only offers theoretical underpinnings and practical approaches for the innovative evolution of the Jin-style filigree mosaic art but also serves as a model for the contemporary protection and promotion of other ICH initiatives.

    "abstract": "The high-speed relative motion between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and terrestrial users induces high Doppler shifts, which disrupt subcarrier orthogonality in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), introducing severe intercarrier interference (ICI) and degrading system performance. Using delay Doppler (DD) domain signal mapping, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation can preserve waveform orthogonality under high Doppler conditions, effectively mitigating ICI through its inherent resistance to time-frequency channel variations. In OTFS systems operating with high Doppler frequency shifts, the core technical challenge lies in the estimation of the channel, which is critically dependent on the pilot design. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel superimposed pilot-based channel estimation method for OTFS systems, which innovatively superimposes pilot and data symbols in the delay-Doppler domain through power-sharing modulation, where the pilot employs constant-envelope design for PAPR control. The proposed solution incorporates fractional Doppler precompensation using phase correction θ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k,l</inf> to mitigate distortion and the guard-interval suppressed boundary leakage to protect superimposed pilots. It also centralized pilot clustering at (k<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf>, 1<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf>) to minimize Doppler sensitivity and implements parameter processing in the receiver-side channel estimation algorithm specifically optimized for satellite communication scenarios. Simulation results show that, compared to the traditional constant-amplitude high-power pilot and current single-centerpoint unprotected interval superimposed pilot, this method effectively reduces the peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme outperform the benchmark schemes, which are highly applicable to the OTFS system in LEO satellite scenarios."

    "abstract": "The dynamic pace at which products are innovated, especially the consumer electronics, is changing the world industries. As the corporations focus on improving the quality of life by developing new products all the time, matters become more complex in balancing the variety of the product lines with the requirement to act in harmony with the sustainability requirements. Maintaining the balance between innovation, productivity and environmental stewardship is also a major issue and particularly in high turnover industries like the smartphones, where life cycle is also short and competition is very high making issues of ecology and social responsibility more prominent. This paper introduces a hybrid Product Sustainability Index (ProdSI) model that combines the use of Fuzzy-AHP and Entropy weighting with the machine learning (ML) technologies to compare and forecast the sustainability and pricing of flagship smartphones: Apple iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Forty-three indicators, in relation to environmental, social, and economic spheres, were evaluated. The results of the experiments prove the higher sustainability of iPhone 15 Pro which attended the higher normalized ProdSI score as it is better performing in the aspects of energy efficiency, recyclability, and social compliance. XGBoost, of the models tested, had a prediction accuracy of 95% compared to the traditional regression models and feature importance and scatter plot analysis revealed the heavy dependence of sustainability measures on predicting prices. The results demonstrate that not only data-driven benchmarking is supported by ML-driven sustainability assessment, but also cost optimization, anomaly detection, and enhanced strategies of developing products. This publication shows how responsible innovation, which is based on intelligent analytics, can balance environmental goals with industry competitiveness and support the development of ecosystems of sustainable product development."

This paper proposes a novel multi-modal retrieval and analysis framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Causal Relation Extraction, CLIP-based image embedding, and Latent Con-textual Modeling (LCM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to link textual and visual aviation accident evidence. The system enables users to upload new incident images, such as those from newspapers or social media, and automatically match them with similar historical accidents, revealing causes and contributing factors through generative explanation. This pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of a next-generation decision-support tool for aviation safety that is interpretable, context-aware, and multi-modal. Experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively identifies and aligns latent representations across modalities, while the LLM generates coherent, contextually grounded explanations."

    "abstract": "In the current educational context, the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed how students access, process, and produce information. However, concerns have emerged regarding the extent to which AI facilitates the genuine generation of knowledge versus superficial task completion. This article presents the design and initial validation of a comprehensive model to measure knowledge generation in higher education, emphasizing the role of pedagogical mediation and the responsible integration of AI tools. The model is built on four interrelated dimensions: pedagogical mediation, use of AI, infrastructure and access to resources, and motivation in AI use. Each dimension includes key variables and indicators derived from a literature review and expert validation. Data were collected through surveys administered to 20 professors and 330 students who participated in AI-integrated courses after teacher training workshops. Preliminary descriptive results show that students felt more motivated to learn autonomously and perceived that AI tools helped them better understand content. The model offers a novel, structured approach to assess whether knowledge is truly being generated through AI-enhanced learning, setting the groundwork for further analysis using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA)."

    "abstract": "Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming is the de facto mechanism for delivering video over heterogeneous and time-varying wireless networks. However, volatile bandwidth, interference, mobility, and resource contention complicate bitrate selection and buffer control, often degrading users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). Traditional rule-based ABR algorithms struggle to generalize across diverse conditions. Recent work demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can jointly reason over network dynamics and player status to optimize QoE, including quality, rebuffering, smoothness, and latency. This paper surveys DRL-based ABR advances from 2022 to 2025 in wireless contexts and emphasizes the role of open and reproducible research using ns-3 for network simulation and FFmpeg for video processing and objective quality assessment (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, VMAF). We first formalize the DRL problem for ABR (state, action, and reward design), then discuss how ns-3 models cellular and Wi-Fi environments and how FFmpeg enables practical bitrate ladders, decoding, trace generation, and automated quality evaluation. We synthesize findings across recent works on access-point-assisted ABR, meta-RL bitrate guidance, cross-layer optimization for real-time communication, fairness-aware multiuser bandwidth allocation at the mobile edge, and throughput prediction for ABR. We highlight reported gains, modeling choices, and, critically, open-source availability where indicated. We conclude by outlining open challenges—generalization, QoE modeling, and real-world deployment—and advocating for open-source benchmarks, datasets, and truly end-to-end ns-3+FFmpeg pipelines to accelerate impactful and reproducible research in DRL-driven ABR for wireless video streaming."

The system implements automatic model selection and logarithmic transformation to handle variance instability and nonstationary patterns in trade data. Comparative analysis shows that the ARIMA model consistently outperforms ETS in terms of MAPE, particularly for monetary variables, while ETS occasionally provides lower MAE and RMSE values for smoother time-series data. The evaluation revealed that both models faced challenges in accurately forecasting highvariance export quantities. Despite this, ARIMA demonstrates better adaptability to complex economic patterns and serves as a reliable baseline for short- and medium-term forecasting. The application is deployed via an interactive Gradio interface, making advanced forecasting tools accessible to non-technical stakeholders, such as policymakers and trade planners. Future work will explore hybrid and multivariate approaches to enhance the predictive performance by incorporating external economic and environmental factors."

Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system combines lightweight visual perception with Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into the structured textual descriptions, which LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments."

The end-to-end equivalent channel under maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming is de-rived and modeled as a Gamma distribution. A closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) is obtained in terms of Meijer G-functions, and the analytical findings are validated via Monte Carlo simulations. To further characterize system performance, the asymptotic expression of the OP and the associated diversity order are also derived. The effectiveness of the active RIS in mitigating multiplicative fading through signal amplification is evaluated by comparison with a conventional passive RIS scheme, revealing substantial performance improvements. Moreover, the impact of hardware impairments and channel shadowing is examined. On the sensing side, the proposed ISAC system is compared with a traditional radar in terms of beampattern gain."

    "abstract": "As data continues to expand rapidly, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has become an essential tool for data compression, representation learning, and the creation of synthetic data. By applying a probabilistic mapping into a latent distribution, it is able to reconstruct inputs and produce new variations. However, VAE implementations on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) remain limited, especially for the MNIST dataset, indicating the gap to explore optimal and efficient hardware architectures. This research designs and develops an integrated circuit for the encoder block of a VAE on an FPGA with minimized inference latency by utilizing an Inline-Array architecture. A semi-parallel architecture was used as the baseline. Implementation on the Kria KV260 FPGA with a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$28 \\times 28$</tex> MNIST input started with a grid search for model setup, followed by RTL synthesis and verification using a testbench and PYNQ. Results show that the Inline-Array reduces latency by approximately 0.0025 seconds compared to the CPU and 0.00076 seconds compared to the Semi-Parallel approach, lowers power consumption by 3.95 %, and optimizes resource utilization through an adder tree design. The reconstruction accuracy was generally the same as CPU and Semi-Parallel results, except for digit “2,” which produced a larger error because of fixed-point quantization overflow. These results show that the Inline-Array has good potential as a low-power and low-latency VAE accelerator for edge computing applications."

However, conventional chaotic systems often suffer from limitations in entropy, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the quality of randomness. This study proposes an enhancement method based on Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided quantum XYZ rotational encoding applied to Lorenz, Chen, and Rossler systems. The chaotic sequences are further amplified using a single-qubit quantum circuit with Hadamard, RX, RY, and RZ rotations. The evaluation conducted before (classic) and after the transformation (quantum) includes key aspects: LE, Shannon entropy, autocorrelation, bifurcation diagram, trajectories, and NIST SP 800-22 statistical testing. To ensure robust statistical assessment, the chaotic sequences were generated using a Multiple-Run Strategy with varying initial conditions to construct bitstreams suitable for NIST analysis. The results demonstrate significant improvements: LE increased up to tenfold, entropy values approached theoretical limits, autocorrelation decreased notably, and all sequences successfully passed the NIST tests under recommended parameters. These findings affirm the potential of LE-guided quantum rotations as an effective strategy for enhancing chaotic dynamics and improving the statistical security of cryptography keystreams."

To resolve this, this study proposes a holistic model in the trustworthy detection of anomalies in the environment of cloud replication, whilst having twofold aims of improving data safety as well as robust surveillance. The suggested solution gathers the information of various sources in a systematic manner, such as user profiles, access logs, and cloud records. By using modern technologies like AWS CloudTrail and Apache Kafka, the data is preprocessed, cleansed, normalized and features extracted. The feature engineering is critical in shaping the user behavior patterns with the consideration of factors like frequency of logins, access patterns of files and system command. In anomaly detection, the framework uses a variety of strategies, such as unsupervised learning algorithms (k-means, isolation forest), statistical approaches, and neural networks (autoencoders, RNNs). Proactive security is provided by real-time notifications, automated reactions and interactive dashboards, and smoothly integrated into Security information and event management frameworks (SIEM). Extensive tests prove the effectiveness of the framework in identifying illegal access and the provision of security teams with practical information. The study provides a sophisticated solution to enhance the security of the cloud and solve identity theft and access control in outsourced data environments."

To investigate this effect, MATLAB SIMULINK has been used for time-domain simulation. A single phase unloaded transformer has been simulated. A two-term polynomial of order seven is used to simulate the transformer's magnetization characteristic. Linear resistance is used to model the core loss. The impact of changing the input voltage has been investigated. MOVs with different characteristics have been taken and the points of breakdown have been found out under sustained ferroresonance. This work can help to choose MOV of proper rating for specific transformer application."

    "abstract": "The potential of Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) to extend the operating lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) through energy harvesting and replenishment approaches has attracted a lot of attention. However, in order to maximize energy use, minimize communication overhead, and guarantee network stability, an effective clustering mechanism is essential. In this work, we propose a hybrid clustering method to efficiently arrange sensor nodes in a WRSN by combining the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with K-Means clustering. K-Means clustering, which swiftly divides sensor nodes into K groups according to their physical closeness and ensures a balanced load distribution among clusters, is the first step in the process. Nevertheless, K-Means’s ability to handle overlapping clusters and distribute nodes probabilistically is limited. In order to improve flexibility in dynamic network environments, we use GMM to optimize the clustering process by taking into account the probabilistic distribution of sensor nodes inside each cluster. More precise and adaptable clustering is produced by iteratively optimizing cluster membership probability using the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. Key performance indicators like Silhouette Score, energy consumption analysis, and network lifespan estimation are used to evaluate performance and show notable increases in clustering efficiency and energy savings. By offering an effective, flexible, and scalable clustering solution in WRSNs, the suggested hybrid strategy improves resource management and lengthens sensor networks’ lifespan."

We present two RetinaNet-based single-stage models: DistinaNet and DistinaNet-BBoxExt, enhancing the RetinaNet architecture with distance estimation capabilities via ExtraHead and BBoxExtension strategies. Benchmarked on the KITTI dataset, DistinaNet outperforms state-of-the-art object-specific methods by 44.82% in MAE. Ablation studies show that adding the distance estimation task does not degrade detection performance. We also analyze FPN layer contributions, head architectures, and loss functions. Both models demonstrate strong generalization to unseen real-world driving scenarios, validated using data captured from a custom data collection pipeline.

This study presents a stereo vision-based skeleton pose estimation framework that incorporates a Proximity Index (PI) to evaluate the distance between human body joints and predefined risk zones. Using the ZED 2i stereo camera, both RGB images and depth maps were acquired to enable reliable three-dimensional pose estimation. The proposed method extracts skeleton data from static images, computes a joint-to-zone distance metric, and classifies safety states based on threshold PI values. Unlike conventional 2D pose estimation approaches, the integration of stereo depth information improves accuracy in proximity evaluation and risk detection. To validate the framework, experiments were conducted in a office environment, simulating scenarios where workers approached restricted or hazardous areas. The results confirm that the method effectively detects abnormal proximity behaviors and supports real-time safety monitoring in workplace settings."

Simulation results show that noise reduction is possible at both the virtual and physical microphone locations. In particular, the noise reduction at the physical microphone location is about 0 dB with the conventional method, whereas it is about −27 dB with the proposed method."

Power loss of the signals which is caused by rain absorption and scattering of r.f. energy leads to the poor internet speed and/or complete discontinuity. Parameters such as intensity of rainfall, its frequency, distance and obstructions are responsible for the signal attenuation. In this research paper we have studied the effect of rain on various types of internet services e.g. cellular networks, satellite internet and Wi-Fi. Different strategies to overcome the rain’s impact on Wi-Fi e.g. using the weather proof equipments, placing the routers strategically and using the mesh networks are also covered in this paper.

While machine learning approaches using flow-level metadata have emerged as promising alternatives, their black-box nature prevents analysts from understanding or trusting the results. In this paper, we propose an interpretable framework that not only detects malicious encrypted traffic but also explains why a session is flagged and how operators should respond. Our approach integrates a Random Forest classifier with SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to provide both global insights into model behavior and local, per-session explanations. A domain-aware explanation engine further translates SHAP outputs into semantic interpretations and automated security recommendations, enabling even non-expert operators to understand causes and mitigation strategies. These results are delivered through an interactive dashboard that supports analyst-driven investigation and response. Experiments on a public encrypted traffic dataset demonstrate that our system maintains high detection accuracy (>99%) while bridging the gap between model prediction and human-centered decision-making."

Current fixed-dose regimens lack adaptability to patient-specific tumor and immune dynamics, limiting treatment effectiveness. This study proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on a biologically informed mathematical model of tumor volume and immune cell density interactions. Using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the RL agent learns continuous drug dosing policies that are validated through simulation of nonlinear tumor growth and immune response under clinical constraints. Results indicate average tumor volume reduction from 0.799 to 0.173, immune cell density improvement from 0.602 to 0.936, and stable, bounded drug dosing consistent with safety limits. Reward progression demonstrates effective balancing of tumor suppression, immune maintenance, and drug toxicity. Our framework also outlines implementation on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for possible real-time clinical decision support. These findings suggest RL-based dosing strategies can provide more personalized and adaptive chemotherapy management than standard protocols."

The proposed approach targets single-channel EEG analysis, i.e., T7 channel from the SEED dataset, for classifying emotions into positive, neutral, and negative states. QLBP acquires subtle variations from EEG signals effectively with strong feature representation. Furthermore, the SVM classifier with various kernels, including polynomial, linear, Radial Basis Function, Gaussian, and with different neighbor values, was tested. The linear kernel yielded the maximum average accuracy of 94.5% with two neighbors. The findings highlight the advantages of combining QLBP with SVM to determine its feasibility for implementing an efficient real-world mental state estimation system."

    "abstract": "Skin diseases affect a significant portion of the global population, leading to considerable physical discomfort and psychological distress. It is still hard to make an accurate diagnosis because the symptoms of many different skin diseases are hard to tell apart and seem to be quite similar and, and in severe conditions it is cancerous. Also, the traditional way of doing a visual exam takes a long time and is likely to make mistakes. The goal of this project is to provide a new way to diagnose skin illnesses that uses Blind Chromophore Separation (BCS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the GrabCut algorithm. This procedure would be quick, correct, and not hurt at all. The BCS method uses pictures of the skin to get important chromophore information, like the amount of melanin and hemoglobin, which shows how healthy the skin is overall. More particular, convolutional neural networks are used to assess these chromophore-based photos. They achieve this by spotting minute patterns and appropriately categorizing a variety of skin diseases. The GrabCut algorithm also makes lesion segmentation better by making sure that damaged areas are appropriately taken out for future study. The suggested framework offers many benefits, such as improving the accuracy of diagnoses, minimizing the need for expert help, and giving a solution that can be used in real clinical settings. More work will be done in the future to make it easier to find and classify skin disorders earlier. To do this, the dataset will need to be bigger and the AI model will need to be smarter."

We propose TabBoost, an ensemble framework combining LightGBM’s efficiency and interpretability with TabNet’s adaptive feature learning. Experiments on real-world lifelog datasets demonstrate that TabBoost consistently outperforms individual baselines, achieving up to 33.40% improvement in key metrics.

The maximum cycle saving for a noisy ADC is reduced from 60% to 52% for an 16b ADC with an SNR of 70 dB."

    "abstract": "Advances in information technology are encouraging businesses to manage operations more efficiently, including in the culinary industry, such as cafés. To support this, an integrated cafe management system is needed to help manage operational activities effectively, from raw material management to sales reporting. One of the main challenges is the accurate estimation of raw material requirements to avoid overstocking or understocking. This study aims to develop a web-based café management system equipped with a raw material requirement forecasting feature using the Weighted Moving Average (WMA). This method assigns greater weight to the most recent data to make the forecasting results more adaptive to usage trends. The system was developed using the Laravel framework and includes front-end and back-end features, raw material data management, usage, forecasting, sales, and reporting. The forecasting results show that the system can generate predictions that closely approximate the data patterns used. This system can illustrate the implementation of forecasting methods in raw material management and support an efficient decision-making process in procurement and café operational management."

In this work, we present a reflective semi-conductor optical amplifier (RSOA) butt-coupled to an extended distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI). Lithium niobate (LN) is an asset material because of its electro optic (EO) effect. This laser exhibits a threshold current of 90 mA and a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of at least 35 dB. Leveraging the EO effect in LN, we demonstrate Bragg grating tuning at 3.14 GHz/V. Additionally, we present the RF design of a transmission line on LNOI, outlining the pathway toward a fast tunable Indium Phosphide (InP)-LNOI DBR laser operating at 1550 nm."

While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoders combined with temporal models such as LSTMs have been widely adopted, they are limited in capturing long-range spatial dependencies and global context within visual sequences. This paper introduces a lightweight vision transformer-based sequence-to-action (ViT-S2A) network that integrates a compact ViT encoder with an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based temporal aggregation module to directly predict discrete driving actions. To validate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a synthetic sequence-to-action benchmark, where object trajectories correspond to left, straight, or right movements. Comparative experiments demonstrate that ViT-S2A consistently outperforms a CNN-LSTM baseline in both convergence speed and prediction accuracy, that highlights the effectiveness of global attention in modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. These results indicate that transformer-based architectures offer a promising direction for scalable, data-efficient autonomous driving control models."

However, centralized dispatching exposes privacy and reliability risks, including single points of failure and leakage of routing and transaction data. Blockchainbased Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) address these limitations by moving frequent interactions off-chain while maintaining verifiable settlement on-chain. This paper presents a blockchain-anchored privacy-preserving path optimization protocol that supports variable-amount multihop payments over PCNs. By combining Pedersen commitments and lightweight zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), the protocol verifies transaction correctness without revealing amounts, and employs blind-channel operations to prevent intermediaries from accessing sensitive data. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves strong privacy protection and scalability with low computational cost, making it suitable for blockchain-based IoT delivery environments."

    "abstract": "Around the world, many people still don’t have access to financial services, and this issue is especially common in countries with lower or moderate incomes where it is difficult for marginalised groups to obtain official financial services. In order to improve predictive modelling for financial inclusion, this work explores the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including boosting-tree transfer learning. The study uses mobile money transaction records and publicly accessible financial survey data, combining behavioural, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. Transfer learning is used to adjust models across regions with restricted data availability, whereas gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) are utilised as the base learners because of their excellent capacity to model nonlinear relationships. The model was tested using stratified kfold cross-validation, and its performance was measured with metrics like area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 -score. The outcomes show that boosting-tree transfer learning achieves 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.92 on test sets, outperforming baseline models like logistic regression and random forests. Crucially, there are few differences across age and gender groups in fairness-aware judgement, which lowers the possibility of algorithmic exclusion. According to the results, boosting-tree transfer learning offers a scalable strategy to promote inclusive financial systems around the world by enhancing predictive accuracy and facilitating equitable decision-making."

While previous studies have primarily utilized Wi-Fi 4 and 5, this work investigates the feasibility of liquid sensing using the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard. We use Channel State Information (CSI) to distinguish between different liquids placed along the Line-Of-Sight (LoS) path, and address challenges specific to Wi-Fi 6E equipped with Intel Ax210.

Early detection of dysgraphia is vital for intervention, yet traditional diagnostic methods are often subjective and time-consuming. This paper introduces hand-crafted feature extraction along with features extracted using the VGG16 network through transfer learning. The methodology involves the extraction of different features like baseline angle, pen pressure, slant angle, letter size, line spacing, and word spacing along with 8 different features using a pre-trained VGG16 model by applying transfer learning. Finally, a hybrid model is developed by combining handcrafted and VGG16 features. The final feature set is used to train different machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest for classification. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach in terms of Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Accuracy. The Random Forest outperformed other models, producing an accuracy of 88.9 %. Experimental results show the improvement in the performance of dysgraphia detection using the hybrid method."

The algorithm was designed, tested, and applied to the Italian National Fire Rescue and Service (Corpo Nazionale dei Vigili del Fuoco – CNVVF). Due to the peculiarities of the institutional activity of the public rescue and safety service of the CNVVF, it is crucial and mandatory to have a tool that can evaluate the effects of replacing traditional mobility while maintaining high efficiency and business continuity.

    "abstract": "Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) such as performance, security, reliability, and usability significantly influence the overall quality of software systems. However, traditional NFR engineering approaches commonly treat these requirements as binary constraints, i.e., either fully satisfied or not, which limits systematic trade-off reasoning even in conventional single-system software architectures. This limitation becomes critical in complex, dynamic domains such as IoT and cyber-physical systems, where multiple interdependent NFRs must coexist without degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a domain-specific framework for modeling and optimizing priority-based NFRs beyond binary constraints. The framework integrates standard well-recognized quality models like ISO/IEC 25010 and FURPS+, to identify domain-specific NFRs, which are then modeled as soft goals with graded degrees of satisfaction. Priority weights, utility-based reasoning, and multi-objective optimization are integrated to manage conflicts and trade-offs among competing NFRs while preserving system stability. Unlike traditional approaches that enforce a rigidly defined subset of NFRs, the proposed framework enables the combination of multiple NFRs proportionally according to their priority and contextual relevance. The framework is applicable to diverse software-intensive systems including IoT, cloud platforms, healthcare systems, and cyber-physical environments. This work contributes a systematic, scalable, and adaptive approach to proactive NFR management suitable for modern software systems. The concrete research problem addressed is the failure of binary NFR handling in dynamic adaptation settings, leading to over-constrained designs or degraded quality. The framework guarantees improved global utility (15-25% in simulations) and adaptation success (>90%) while maintaining performance thresholds, with low runtime overhead (~O(n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) for n NFRs)."

CRBP utilizes the Bosphorus 3D Face Database, reconstructing textured 3-D meshes for each individual and producing six canonical 2-D projections. To improve model compatibility and minimize background noise, each projection is processed using YOLOv8 for face detection. This results in two organized subsets, namely, CRBP-Raw (full scene) and CRBP-YOLOv8 (face-cropped). This dual-format design facilitates thorough benchmarking of pose-invariant, occlusion-resilient, and expression-aware models within a convolutional neural network-compatible image space. Dataset statistics indicate that YOLOv8 enhances facial alignment, however, it also introduces sample selection bias, especially in extreme yaw and occlusion scenarios. CRBP facilitates applications in emotion recognition, biometric authentication, and avatar creation. The dataset is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/4qns-ys45."
