    "abstract": "Optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum offer additional degrees of freedom. According to the orientation of orbital angular momentum, optical vortices can be classified into spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinalorbital angular momentum and spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum. As an emerging subset of optical vortices, polygonal optical vortices provide a unique platform for a wide range of frontier applications by introducing a new degree of freedom in the form of a customizable intensity structure. In the spatial domain, polygonal spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinal orbital angular momentum have already demonstrated great potential in optical manipulation and two-photon lithography. However, polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets contain multiple sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum remains unrealized to date. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortices wavepackets embedded with prescribed vortex structures. Within the structure, a prescribed number of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum is set along a designed polygonal spatiotemporal trajectory. Using the spatiotemporal holographic shaping approach, we generate polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket and use the combination of multiple polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket to form polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket with the prescribed vortex structure. A full control over multiple key properties of the polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets such as the geometry, number of phase singularities, and spatiotemporal distribution of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices is also achieved."

    "abstract": "Applying speech super-resolution (SR) to recordings with severely low sampling rates is a critical challenge in digital archiving and investigative audio recovery. In these scenarios, the input lacks essential acoustic cues. Consequently, existing generative models often fail; without sufficient context, they hallucinate phonetic content, guessing words based on probability rather than meaning. To address this, we propose CogSR, a framework designed specifically for high-precision, offline restoration. Our approach shifts the focus from simple signal mapping to cognitive reconstruction. By integrating a Large Audio-Language Model, we employ Chain-of-Thought reasoning to act as a semantic anchor, while explicit acoustic priors ensure the speaker's identity remains consistent. This guides a Rectified Flow backbone to synthesize high-frequency details that are not only realistic but linguistically accurate. Evaluations show that CogSR effectively eliminates ambiguity in severe degradation regimes, making it a robust solution for restoring high-value legacy and surveillance audio."

As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems."

We detect striking changes in the large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry over the course of just a few stellar rotations, a level of short-term global magnetic field evolution rarely reported in M dwarfs. We modeled the temporal variation of the longitudinal magnetic field using a Gaussian regression process, which allowed us to robustly determine the stellar rotation period and quantify the evolution timescale of the magnetic field. Independent Zeeman Doppler Imaging reconstructions of the two epochs confirm a significant reconfiguration of the star's global magnetic strength and topology. The detection of a weaker, complex, axisymmetric magnetic field (mean $|B| \\sim 201$~G), which changes into a stronger, non-axisymmetric, dipole-dominated field (mean $|B| \\sim 276$~G) over a few rotation cycles, is in contrast to results from similar fully convective M-dwarf stars. YZ Cet is known to exhibit polarized radio bursts potentially driven by auroral radio emission from star--planet interaction (SPI). By combining our magnetic maps with recent radio observations, we refine the constraints on the magnetic field strength of the innermost planet, YZ Cet b. These results underscore the importance of monitoring stellar magnetic variability to interpret multi-wavelength SPI signatures and to characterize the magnetospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets."

To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance."

    "abstract": "Accurate and interpretable classification of infant cry paralinguistics is essential for early detection of neonatal distress and clinical decision support. However, many existing deep learning methods rely on correlation-driven acoustic representations, which makes them vulnerable to noise, spurious cues, and domain shifts across recording environments. We propose DACH-TIC, a Domain-Agnostic Causal-Aware Hierarchical Audio Transformer for robust infant cry classification. The model integrates causal attention, hierarchical representation learning, multi-task supervision, and adversarial domain generalization within a unified framework. DACH-TIC employs a structured transformer backbone with local token-level and global semantic encoders, augmented by causal attention masking and controlled perturbation training to approximate counterfactual acoustic variations. A domain-adversarial objective promotes environment-invariant representations, while multi-task learning jointly optimizes cry type recognition, distress intensity estimation, and causal relevance prediction. The model is evaluated on the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets, with ESC-50 environmental noise overlays for domain augmentation. Experimental results show that DACH-TIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including HTS-AT and SE-ResNet Transformer, achieving improvements of 2.6 percent in accuracy and 2.2 points in macro-F1 score, alongside enhanced causal fidelity. The model generalizes effectively to unseen acoustic environments, with a domain performance gap of only 2.4 percent, demonstrating its suitability for real-world neonatal acoustic monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications."

This complicated five-component model is reduced to a three-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with convection by introducing a stream function. The system obtained is examined by the classical Lie method. A complete Lie symmetry classification is derived via a rigorous algorithm. In particular, it is proved that the widest Lie algebras of invariance occur when the stream function generate a linear velocity field. The most interesting cases (from the symmetry and applicability point of view) are further studied in order to derive exact solutions. A wide range of exact solutions are constructed for radially-symmetric stream functions. These solutions include time-dependent and radially symmetric solutions as well as more complicated solutions expressed in terms of the Weierstrass function. It was shown that some of exact solutions can be used for demonstration of spatiotemporal evolution of concentrations corresponding to two reactants and their product."

We use the theory of generalised wreath products to give necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the `array' of a point-subset $B$, for the set of $G$-images of $B$ to form the block-set of a $G$-block-transitive $2$-design. This generalises previous results for the special cases where the poset is a chain or an anti-chain. We also give explicit infinite families of examples of $2$-designs for each poset involving three proper partitions, and for the famous $N$-poset with four partitions. (Posets with two proper partitions have been treated previously.) This suggests the problem of finding explicit examples for other posets."

    "abstract": "Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc. We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize: L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud, where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space. Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models."

However, the data providers of this knowledge face a skewed tradeoff between income and risk: they receive little share of downstream value yet retain copyright and privacy liability, making them reluctant to contribute their assets to LLM services. Existing techniques do not offer a trustworthy and controllable way to use professional knowledge, because they keep providers in the dark and combine knowledge parameters with the underlying LLM backbone. In this paper, we present PKUS, the Professional Knowledge Utilization System, which treats professional knowledge as a first-class, separable artifact. PKUS keeps the backbone model on GPUs and encodes each provider's contribution as a compact adapter that executes only inside an attested Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). A hardware-rooted lifecycle protocol, adapter pruning, multi-provider aggregation, and split-execution scheduling together make this design practical at serving time. On SST-2, MNLI, and SQuAD with GPT-2 Large and Llama-3.2-1B, PKUS preserves model utility, matching the accuracy and F1 of full fine-tuning and plain LoRA, while achieving the lowest per-request latency with 8.1-11.9x speedup over CPU-only TEE inference and naive CPU-GPU co-execution."

It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

Chem. Phys. 119, 5320 (2003)]. At variance with the existence of disconnected terms in the IN-GMS-SU-CCSD amplitude equations, the disconnected terms in the PASPT2 amplitude equations can be avoided completely by choosing a special reference-specific zeroth-order Hamiltonian. The corresponding effective/intermediate Hamiltonian can also be made connected and closed, so as to render the energies obtained by diagonalization fully connected. As such, PASPT2 is strictly size-extensive, in sharp contrast with the parent IN-GMS-SU-CCSD. It is also size-consistent when the PAS of a supermolecule is chosen to be the direct product of those of the physically separated, non-interacting fragments. Prototypical systems are taken as showcases to reveal the efficacy of PASPT2."

    "abstract": "We investigated whether \"velocity excess\" in circumstellar maser lines can diagnose the earliest evolutionary phases of Water Fountains (WFs). Here we define \"velocity excess\" as maser emission (e.g., H$_2$O 22.235 GHz or OH 1665/1667 MHz) detected at velocities outside the velocity range of the OH 1612 MHz line, which traces the terminal expansion velocity of a spherical circumstellar envelope (CSE). Such excess velocities serve as an indicator of gas motions deviating from spherical expansion and may signify the onset of asymmetric outflows. Based on recent studies (Fan et al.2024; Xie et al.2025), we analyzed 17 sources showing velocity excess and fitted their infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with the one-dimensional radiative transfer code DUSTY. Seven sources are well reproduced, implying outer CSEs that remain nearly spherical despite inner asymmetries. Among these, five exhibit single-peaked, AGB-like SEDs and two show double-peaked, post-AGB-like profiles. IRAS variability indices and NEOWISE-R light curves reveal pulsations (~600-1000 days) in three sources, supporting their AGB classification. Considering the magnitude of the velocity excess, two objects-IRAS 19229+1708 and IRAS 19052+0922-may represent the earliest or incipient WF phase, in which asymmetric outflows are beginning to emerge within otherwise spherical envelopes. These results support a morphological sequence in which bipolar jets and tori arise first in the central regions while the outer CSE remains spherical, and they show that selecting WF candidates via velocity excess effectively identifies objects at the onset of jet formation and early morphological transformation."

    "abstract": "The unexpected emergence of ferroelectricity in HfO2 at reduced dimensions has attracted considerable attention, as it provides a pathway toward the realization of ultrasmall ferroelectric devices. Ab initio calculations suggest that this effect arises from a unique mode coupling, in which an antipolar displacement mode stabilizes a robust polar distortion. Based on these insights, Landau-Devonshire energy models have been proposed using such lattice modes as order parameters. However, most existing models are limited to a simplified one-dimensional model because of the computational cost of ab initio calculations and the limitations of conventional Landau polynomials. Here, we constructed a three-dimensional Landau-Devonshire potential for HfO2 by employing the tetragonal, antipolar, and polar modes as coupled order parameters, based on the latest machine-learning technologies. We generated a large-scale dataset of energies over a three-dimensional structural space, with the computational cost drastically reduced through the use of machine-learning interatomic potentials, and trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the relationship between the order parameters and the energy. The energy predicted by the MLP successfully captures the characteristic coupling behavior whereby the antipolar modes induce the polar mode. Furthermore, by extending this MLP-based Landau potential to a position-dependent functional, that is, to a phase-field modeling framework, we revealed that the polarization magnitude in thin films decreases compared with the bulk state, while the critical strain required for the onset of spontaneous polarization increases due to surface effects. This study presents a new framework for the on-demand construction of Landau energy and phase-field modeling using the latest machine-learning techniques, enabling multiscale analysis of complex ferroelectric phenomena."

However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved. We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events."

In this work, we study the reheating mechanism for an inflaton field with a quartic minimum, assuming that the main particle production channel corresponds to the decay into a pair of spin 1/2 fermions via Yukawa-like interactions. On top of its decays, the self-interaction of the inflaton sources the resonant growth of inflaton inhomogeneities, leading to its eventual fragmentation, unless reheating is completed in a shorter timescale. By means of a combination of non-perturbative (Heisenberg/Bogoliubov) and perturbative (Boltzmann) methods, we find that for Yukawa couplings $y\\gtrsim 10^{-8}$ parametric resonance, kinematic blocking, and Pauli suppression effects cannot be ignored to estimate the fermion energy density during reheating. Reheating prior to nucleosynthesis requires couplings above this threshold, and in particular, reheating occurring before fragmentation is only possible for $y\\gtrsim 0.2$."

    "abstract": "Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods."

Mie voids provide an alternative approach to conventional dielectric resonators that confine optical fields within bulk high-index materials. Building on this concept, here we present a hybrid photonic platform that integrates monolayer WS2 with Mie void resonators patterned in a high-index Bi2Te3 substrate. By carefully aligning the dipolar void resonance with the excitonic transition of WS2, we achieve substantially enhanced photoluminescence and second-harmonic generation. Far-field imaging of the harmonic fields reveals spatially resolved hotspots that directly map localized resonant modes, with their positions tunable by cavity geometry and pump wavelength. This approach enables real-space control of nonlinear emission at the single-resonator level, offering a robust and reconfigurable platform for next-generation nonlinear photonics and surface-enhanced optical sensing."

Here, we use an atomically sharp scanning tunneling microscope probe to vertically manipulate a 2D Mott insulating kagome metal-organic framework (MOF) featuring Kondo-screened local magnetic moments on Ag(111). We show that by controlling the adsorption height of the MOF, we can also controllably and reversibly change the strength of Kondo coupling between the MOF's local spins and the substrate's conduction electrons.

We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks."

This work proposes a multimodal framework that converts hand-drawn cube sketches into graph-structured representations capturing geometric and topological properties, and integrates these features with demographic information and neuropsychological test (NPT) scores for AD classification. Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis identifies specific graphlet motifs and geometric distortions as key predictors, closely aligning with clinical observations of disorganized cube drawings in AD. Together, these results establish graph-based analysis of cube copying as an interpretable, non-invasive, and scalable approach for Alzheimer's disease screening."

Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios."

The heterostructure, consisting of a p-GaN cap, an AlGaN barrier, and a GaN channel supported by two AlGaN/AlGaN superlattice (SL) buffer layers, maintained clear and periodic satellite peaks up to a temperature of 1000 deg C, confirming excellent structural integrity. Symmetric and asymmetric RSM results reveal that both the Si and GaN diffraction peaks shift to lower angles with increasing temperature, consistent with thermal expansion, and show no significant broadening or relaxation throughout the heating process. The c-lattice constant follows the theoretical expansion predicted by the multi-frequency Einstein model, whereas the a-lattice expansion is slower due to in-plane strain constraints imposed by the underlying Si substrate and buffer layers. Rapid lattice contraction during the fast-cooling stage induces a residual compressive strain of approximately 0.3 percent in the GaN channel after cooling. Raman spectra further confirm this strain state through a blue shift of approximately 1.5 cm-1 of the GaN E2 (high) phonon mode, corresponding to an in-plane strain of about 0.2 percent. Rocking-curve analysis reveals an increase in both screw and edge dislocation densities by 28 percent and 12 percent, respectively. These results collectively demonstrate that the GaN HEMT heterostructure exhibits robust crystalline stability up to 1000 deg C, with only minor strain redistribution and limited dislocation activity, providing experimental evidence for GaN device applications under high-temperature conditions."

However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized \"Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation\" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios."

These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research.

In this work, we present a holistic framework integrating machine learning into traditional catalyst design for semiconducting CNT synthesis. It combines knowledge-based insights with data-driven techniques. Three key components, including open-access electronic structure databases for precise physicochemical descriptors, pre-trained natural language processing-based embedding model for higher-level abstractions, and physical - driven predictive models based on experiment data, are utilized. Through this framework, a new method for selective semiconducting CNT synthesis via catalyst - mediated electron injection, tuned by light during growth, is proposed. 54 candidate catalysts are screened, and three with high potential are identified. High-throughput experiments validate the predictions, with semiconducting selectivity exceeding 91% and the FeTiO3 catalyst reaching 98.6%. This approach not only addresses semiconducting CNT synthesis but also offers a generalizable methodology for global catalyst design and nanomaterials synthesis, advancing materials science in precise control."

Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores."

The method constructs a fully antisymmetric wavefunction from the product of two independently antisymmetrized many-body states, each of which may be a superposition of Slater determinants. The algorithm uses a Dicke-state ancilla register that coherently encodes all one-particle exchange channels between the two subsystems, and, crucially, requires only single-particle swaps to generate the full antisymmetric structure. A total of $O(N_T N_p)$ single-particle exchanges are needed, with up to $N_p$ of them implemented in parallel, if an additional $N_p$ ancillae are used. The correct fermionic phase is incorporated through application of $Z$ gates on $N_T$ ancillae, after which the ancilla register is efficiently uncomputed using a compact sequence of controlled operations. This construction provides a nontrivial and scalable protocol for preparing fully antisymmetric states in reaction and scattering simulations, significantly expanding the range of systems that can be addressed with first-quantized quantum algorithms."

    "abstract": "Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently. To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM."

Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines."

We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines.

This meta-display architecture preserves compactness of conventional planar display while exhibiting less data requirements and lower hardware complexity than other near-eye 3D displays. Experimentally, we demonstrate a multi-color near-eye 3D system achieving an 11° field of view, 22 pixels-per-degree angular resolution, 0.9 m depth of field, and 19 distinct image planes. This work establishes a new pathway for metasurfaces toward visual displays and highlights great potential for future virtual/augmented reality."

In this work, we propose a hybrid algorithmic framework that integrates the smooth offset algorithm (SOA) with supervised machine learning models for the fast pricing of multiple path-independent options under exponential Lévy dynamics. Building upon the SOA-generated dataset, we train neural networks, random forests, and gradient boosted decision trees to construct surrogate pricing operators. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that, once trained, these surrogates achieve order-of-magnitude acceleration over direct SOA evaluation. Importantly, the proposed framework overcomes key numerical limitations inherent to fast Fourier transform-based methods, including the consistency of input data and the instability in deep out-of-the-money option pricing."

    "abstract": "Decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) considers a fully-connected network of $K$ users, where each pair of users can communicate bidirectionally over an error-free channel. Each user holds a private input, and the goal is for each user to compute the sum of all inputs without revealing any additional information, even in the presence of collusion among up to $T$ users. Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users. To mitigate the source keys overhead, we study decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints. In this setting, the inputs of a predefined collection of user subsets, called the \\emph{security set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$, must be protected from another predefined collection, the \\emph{collusion set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$. For an arbitrary security set $\\mathcal{S}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$ and an arbitrary collusion set $\\mathcal{T}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$, we characterize the optimal communication and source key rates. A key contribution of this work is the characterization of the optimal source key rate, i.e., the minimum number of key bits per input bit that must be shared among users for decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints to be feasible. In general, this characterization reduces to solving a linear program."

    "abstract": "Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."

    "abstract": "Grid clustering algorithms are valued for their efficiency in large-scale data analysis but face persistent limitations: parameter sensitivity, loss of structural detail at coarse resolutions, and misclassifications of edge or bridge cells at fine resolutions. Previous studies have addressed these challenges through adaptive grids, parameter tuning, or hybrid integration with other clustering methods, each of which offers limited robustness. This paper introduces a grid clustering framework that integrates Laplacian-kernel diffusion imputation and origin-constrained connected-component analysis (OC-CCA) on a uniform grid to reconstruct the cluster topology with high accuracy and computational efficiency. During grid construction, an automated preprocessing stage provides data-driven estimates of cell size and density thresholds. The diffusion step then mitigates sparsity and reconstructs missing edge cells without over-smoothing physical gradients, while OC-CCA constrains component growth to physically consistent origins, reducing false merges across narrow gaps. Operating on a fixed-resolution grid with spatial indexing ensures the scaling of O(nlog n). Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and polymer simulation datasets demonstrate that the method correctly manages edges, preserves cluster topology, and avoids spurious connections. Benchmarking on polymer systems across scales (9k, 180k, and 989k atoms) shows that optimal preprocessing, combined with diffusion-based clustering, reproduces atomic-level accuracy and captures physically meaningful morphologies while delivering accelerated computation."

This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation.

Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models."

The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak. The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance."

    "abstract": "Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%."

(2) Step distillation: TurboDiffusion adopts rCM for efficient step distillation. (3) W8A8 quantization: TurboDiffusion quantizes model parameters and activations to 8 bits to accelerate linear layers and compress the model. In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.

In this study, we model brightness profiles and geometries for 16 dusty disks in the DSHARP observations to identify asymmetric substructures, including possible planet-induced signatures. We find no compelling evidence for circumplanetary emission in these systems. We identify a possible one-armed spiral in Elias 27; while previous studies report an $m=2$ spiral, the morphology of the newly identified spiral agrees with a spiral for a possible protoplanet. Although non-detection of circumplanetary emission is consistent with low expected luminosities, the absence of additional dust spirals except for Elias 27 may constrain properties of potential embedded planets given their theoretical detectability. The analyses further suggest that spiral amplitudes and phases correlated with gap and ring locations in WaOph 6 and IM Lup, appearing as deflections of spirals in images. Five disks exhibit strong residual asymmetries attributable to the vertical extent of their dust layers. We find that the brightness temperature of inner disks ($1$-$5$ au) declines with stellar age on a $\\sim 3$ Myr timescale, while the total flux shows no clear decreasing trend. This trend is consistent with the presence of pressure bumps that retain large dust grains at outer radii, while allowing the inner disks to disperse. The universality of disk dispersal timescale at millimeter wavelengths, observed in both the extended DSHARP disks and the compact disks from previous demographic surveys, may constrain timing of planet formation, including habitable planets."

    "abstract": "Modular manipulators composed of pre-manufactured and interchangeable modules offer high adaptability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules."

For this class, we develop a statistical inference framework for discretely observed trajectories that combines Markov-bridge reconstruction with a stochastic EM algorithm and a gradient-based up- date. The resulting method yields joint maximum-likelihood estimates of both the baseline sub-intensity matrix $Λ$ and the time-scaling parameter $β$. Through simulation studies for the matrix-Gompertz and matrix-Weibull families, and a real-data application to coronary allograft vasculopathy progression, we demonstrate that the proposed approach provides an accurate and computationally tractable tool for fitting time-scaled IPH models to irregular multi-state data."

    "abstract": "Can constantly comparing ourselves to others lead to overconsumption, ultimately increasing the ecological footprint? How do social comparisons shape green preferences over time? To answer these questions, we develop an environmental Overlapping Generations (OLG) model that explicitly accounts for Veblen effects and allows green preferences to be updated asynchronously, influenced by past environmental conditions and relative status considerations. We show that, along the optimal path, positional spending leads to overconsumption, which is detrimental to the environment. Taxing consumption is counterproductive as it does not directly address the social comparisons issue, leaving the problem unchanged. When the Veblenian mechanism is weak, the introduction of a materialistic ``secular trend'' -- that lowers the importance placed on the public good -- gives rise to two stable equilibria separated by a saddle: one in which agents care about environmental quality as much as consuming, and the other in which they derive utility solely from the latter. Studying the basins of attraction reveals that green investments are highly fragile. Our numerical experiments further indicated that, when Veblen effects are strong, the model depicts endogenous, persistent, aperiodic oscillations. In this case, green preferences fluctuate close to zero, and environmental quality is very low. Taken together, these findings suggest environmental vulnerability grows in parallel with status-driven consumption."

We present the first concept-level interpretability study of LLMs in SE, analyzing three tasks - code completion, translation, and refinement - through the lens of internal comment representation. Using Concept Activation Vectors (CAV), we show that LLMs not only internalize comments as distinct latent concepts but also differentiate between subtypes such as Javadocs, inline, and multiline comments. By systematically activating and deactivating these concepts in the LLMs' embedding space, we observed significant, model-specific, and task-dependent shifts in performance ranging from -90% to +67%. Finally, we conducted a controlled experiment using the same set of code inputs, prompting LLMs to perform 10 distinct SE tasks while measuring the activation of the comment concept within their latent representations. We found that code summarization consistently triggered the strongest activation of comment concepts, whereas code completion elicited the weakest sensitivity. These results open a new direction for building SE tools and models that reason about and manipulate internal concept representations rather than relying solely on surface-level input."

We find that this scenario is in agreement with all relevant experimental constraints, comprising the LHC searches for SUSY particles and additional Higgs bosons, the LHC Higgs-boson rate measurements, the DM direct detection limits and the upper limit on the DM relic density.

    "abstract": "We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is almost never a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically energetically suboptimal. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM."

    "abstract": "Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement."

    "abstract": "Molecular Communication (MC) is an emerging field of research focused on understanding how cells in the human body communicate and exploring potential medical applications. In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications."

    "abstract": "The discovery of exoplanets in binary star systems-now numbering about 850 of the nearly 4,600 known exoplanet systems-raises questions about whether observational bias or stellar companions inhibit planet formation. While most studies on terrestrial planet formation assume planar configurations, wide binaries likely feature random inclinations, potentially disrupting planet-forming disks. This study explores the evolution of embryo-planetesimal disks in S-type motion in misaligned binary systems, focusing on the stage after the gas phase when terrestrial planet formation begins and gravitational interactions dominate. Using our GPU-accelerated N-body code GANBISS, we simulate disks with 2,000 planetesimals and 25 planetary embryos, studying the influence of the planetesimals on the evolution of the embryos and tracking their growth through collisions. After the simulations, we analyse collision outcomes with an analytical model. Moreover, for certain inclined binary configurations, we compare dynamically excited (perturbed by the secondary star) with cold disks in inclined configurations, as the distribution after the gas phase in misaligned binaries remains unclear. Our simulations reveal two key outcomes: (i) embryos migrate slightly inward in misaligned systems, and (ii) The initial large oscillations in embryos' inclinations and nodes around the respective values of the secondary star dampen over time. Collision analysis shows distinct differences: planar systems favour accretive collisions, while inclined configurations exhibit more destructive events. These findings underscore the sensitivity of planet formation dynamics to binary star alignment and initial disk conditions."

CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling \"last-mile\" navigation challenges."

We analyze the simultaneous presence of both couplings and determine when one effect dominates the other, in both the metric and Palatini formulations of gravity. The two tendencies interpolate smoothly, but introducing a non-minimal inflaton coupling reduces the viable interval of $ξ_ρ$ in which isocurvature bounds can be alleviated while avoiding backreaction on the inflationary dynamics. We illustrate our findings in Palatini Higgs inflation and Starobinsky inflation."

The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $Γ$. The proximity of $Γ$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{Λ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $Γ$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $Γ$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $ω\\approx \\pm 2πi T_{\\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \\gtrsim {K}{Λ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\\tfracη{s} = \\tfrac{1}{4π}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $ζ=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime."

To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of ε-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an ε*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results."

In particular, models with greater flexibility in their redshift evolution, such as power-law type forms, are mildly preferred over more restrictive parametrizations with similar parameter dimensionality. For the dataset including DESY5, the deviation from $Λ$CDM reaches a significance of $6.26σ$. These results indicate that present data are sensitive to enhanced phantom behaviour and provide clear guidance for constructing phenomenologically viable dark energy parametrizations."

The resulting binder-free electrodes exhibit enhanced mechanical robustness along with structural and chemical stability in various electrolytes. The MXene electrodes demonstrate adequate HER activity while maintaining electrochemical stability over time, with minimal oxidation or changes in termination surface chemistry. This approach is scalable and cost-effective, overcoming limitations of nanoscale MXene architectures in electrochemical environments and offering a practical pathway toward MXene-based materials for sustainable hydrogen energy technologies."

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems have a broad range of applications and map to physical systems with complex dynamics. Among them, the 3-SAT problem is prominent due to its NP-complete nature. In physics terms, its solution corresponds to finding the ground state of a disordered Ising spin Hamiltonian with third-order, or tensor, interactions. The large growth of the number of third-order interactions with number of variables poses technical difficulties for the physical implementation of minimizers. Therefore, researchers have proposed quadratization techniques which reduce the order of the system, however, at the cost of including additional degrees of freedom. Their inclusion induces a drastic slow down in the minimization, which makes such procedures technically infeasible for large problems. In this work, we take a physics approach by employing the renormalization group to create a pairwise interacting system from the original third-order system while preserving the free energy. Our procedure utilizes additional degrees of freedom that exhibit an independent dynamics provided the original degrees of freedom are fixed. A step-wise trace of the extra variables while running the minimization is therefore theoretically manageable, yielding a state-dependent effective interaction. We use the effective interaction to reconstruct the original third-order energy spectrum, as this yields equal scaling of computations-to-ground-state compared to the original tensor formulation. Here, the original degrees of freedom interact with a subsystem that appears to be in a superposition of an exponentially large number of states. In the zero-temperature limit, the superposition concentrates on one state. Our spectrum-engineering techniques reveal new routes toward the ground state of disordered Ising systems, through Markov chains, and allow for efficient technological implementations."

Several data-driven approaches have been developed to approximate these interactions, but they often rely on having large amounts of training data that may be practically difficult to generate. Here, we extend a framework we recently developed for approximating anisotropic pair potentials to the approximation of pairwise forces and torques. The framework uses multivariate polynomials and physics-motivated coordinate transformations to produce accurate approximations using limited amounts of data. We first derive expressions relating the force and torque to partial derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the transformed coordinates used to represent the particle configuration. We then explore several options for approximating the forces and torques, and we critically assess their accuracy using model two- and three-dimensional shape-anisotropic nanoparticles as test cases. We find that interpolation of the pairwise potential energy produces the best result when it is known, but force and torque matching (regression) is a viable strategy when only the force and torque is available."

Furthermore, an analysis of the proposed A-RPCA methods is carried out. Simulation results show that compared to a baseline scheme without preprocessing and without reconciliation, the proposed A-RPCA method substantially reduces the error probability after reconciliation and also substantially increases the detection probabilities that is also 1 in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. We have compared against state-of the-art preprocessing schemes in both synthetic and real datasets, including principal component analysis (PCA) and robust PCA, autoencoders and the recursive projected compressive sensing (ReProCS) framework and we have validated the superior performance of the proposed approach."

Similarities and discrepancies among them are discussed in this paper, together with data-models comparison. The nominal simulations analyzed in this study fail to accurately reproduce the daytime observations of Pioneer Venus, notably overestimating the exospheric temperature. This is linked to an underestimation of the atomic oxygen (O) abundance in the three GCMs, and suggests the need of additional O production in the thermosphere. The selection of solar spectrum is also the main reason for the discrepancies between the models in terms of temperature dependence on solar activity. A list of recommendations is proposed aiming at improving the modeling of Venus' upper atmosphere, among them: 1. Standardize the EUV-UV solar spectrum input. 2. Update the near-infrared heating scheme with Venus Express-Era data. 3. Reassess Radiative cooling schemes. 4. Investigate the underestimated atomic Oxygen abundance."

This architecture enables the real time training of the network parameters using the available magnetic sensor data and, consequently, dynamically adapting the network output to the evolving plasma equilibrium. We demonstrate that, the network performs accurate plasma boundary reconstruction for complex configurations, outperforming well established methods, such as the algorithm used for decades at the Joint European Torus, the world's largest tokamak, until it ceased operation in 2023. Indeed, compared to the latter, the proposed solution better generalizes the poloidal flux function, without requiring algorithm retuning across different plasma equilibria. The proposed neural network reconstructor demonstrates also greater robustness with respect to noise on the magnetic measurements. Moreover, this method takes advantage of the generalization power of neural networks but without the need for extensive, time consuming training based on a huge amount of experimental data, making its implementation on existing devices straightforward."

We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \\emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order.

Yet their discovery has relied almost entirely on intuition and chance, limiting progress in the field. Here we develop and experimentally validate a deep-learning data-to-molecule pipeline that enables the targeted design and synthesis of new organic fluid ferroelectrics. We curate a comprehensive dataset of all known longitudinally polar liquid-crystal materials and train graph neural networks that predict ferroelectric behaviour with up to 95% accuracy and achieve root mean square errors as low as 11 K for transition temperatures. A graph variational autoencoder generates de novo molecular structures which are filtered using an ensemble of high-performing classifiers and regressors to identify candidates with predicted ferroelectric nematic behaviour and accessible transition temperatures. Integration with a computational retrosynthesis engine and a digitised chemical inventory further narrows the design space to a synthesis-ready longlist. 11 candidates were synthesised and characterized through established mixture-based extrapolation methods. From which extrapolated ferroelectric nematic transitions were compared against neural network predictions. The experimental verification of novel materials augments the original dataset with quality feedback data thus aiding future research.

    "abstract": "Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches."

    "abstract": "The augmented Lagrangian (AL) method has been successfully applied for solving the full waveform inversion (FWI) problem. In AL-based FWI, the Lagrange multipliers serve as source extensions, offering several advantages to the inversion, such as improved robustness to cycle skipping, faster convergence, and simplified penalty parameter tuning. Time-domain applications of this method have been enabled by reformulating the optimization problem in the data space, significantly reducing memory requirements by projecting source-side multipliers into the data space. These data-side multipliers act as data extensions, effectively expanding the data space. A key challenge in these methods lies in computing the data-side multipliers, which involves solving a linear system to deblur the data residuals using the data-space Hessian matrix before it serves as the adjoint source. This Hessian matrix is prohibitively large to construct and invert explicitly. Iterative Krylov methods can be applied to solve this system as inner iterations, but they require two PDE solves per inner iteration per source, leading to significant computational costs. In this work, we present a key improvement to extended waveform inversion based on multiplier methods. We propose a novel approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of Hessian inversion. The method computes receiver-side Green functions in the time domain and directly constructs frequency-domain Hessian matrices for all required frequencies. These Hessian matrices, with dimensions equal to the number of receivers, can be computed, inverted, and stored in memory. Once constructed, they can be used simultaneously for all sources, further enhancing efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the substantial computational gains achieved by the proposed method, highlighting its effectiveness for extended-source FWI in the time domain."

    "abstract": "In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation."

Using International Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) data at 144 MHz and Chandra data at 0.3-6 keV, we find that the co-spatial diffuse radio and X-ray emission is well described by synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes by the same electron population. Through modelling of this rare low-energy plasma, we find that the most defining property of the electrons up-scattering CMB photons at this redshift is very low electron Lorentz factors ($γ_{\\text{max}}\\ll 10^{4}$ and $γ_{\\text{break}}\\lesssim 10^{3}$) in the lobe: deep low frequency (<150 MHz) observations are critical to the detection of radio lobes at high redshift. The physical conditions imply a total energy in the diffuse emission significantly greater than that implied by the temperature of the protocluster gas: 3C 294 is one of the most powerful known radio-loud systems in a dense protocluster environment. Through resolved spectral analysis of archival radio data up to 15 GHz, we find evidence that the inner hotspots are due to restarted activity, while the outer hotspots remain energetic, suggesting a rapid duty cycle while the jet precesses. This allowed the low-energy aged plasma driving the X-rays to remain spatially distinct from the high-energy plasma. Together, our results promise a revelation of AGN-related radio emission at high redshift using future low-frequency arrays such as SKA-LOW."

    "abstract": "Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source."

    "abstract": "Future telescopes such as the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) will enable mid-infrared characterisation of the atmospheres of nearby rocky exoplanets. Whilst 4D spatial and temporal variations of Earth as an exoplanet are below spectroscopic detection limits, such variability is planet-specific. We investigate LIFE's ability to detect 4D variability in the atmospheres of tidally locked exoplanets. We create daily synthetic LIFE observations of Proxima Centauri b in a 1:1 and an eccentric 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (SOR), using LIFEsim on spectra from daily 3D climate-chemistry model output of an aquaplanet with Earth-like composition. Hemispheric distributions of temperature, clouds, and chemical species determine spectral signatures and variability with orbital phase angle. Such variability dictates the extent to which parameters can be reliably inferred from snapshot spectra at arbitrary viewing geometries. In the 1:1 SOR, MIR spectra vary significantly with viewing geometry and indirectly probe atmospheric circulation. Nightside temperature inversions generate O3, CO2, and H2O emission features, though these lie below LIFE's detection threshold, and instead O3 features disappear at certain phase angles. In contrast, the 3:2 SOR yields a more homogeneous atmosphere with weaker phase variability but enhanced bolometric flux due to eccentric heating. Phase-resolved LIFE observations confidently distinguish between the SORs and capture seasonal O3 variability for golden targets like Proxima Centauri b. In case of abiotic O2/O3 build-up, the O3 variability presents a potential false positive scenario. Hence, LIFE can disentangle different spin-orbit states and resolve 4D atmospheric variability, enabling daily characterisation of the 4D physical and chemical state of nearby terrestrial worlds. Importantly, this characterisation requires phase-resolved rather than snapshot spectra."

Findings reveal that most papers address lower levels of uncertainty and rarely consider dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty simultaneously, which limits the effectiveness of resilience strategies.

The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones."

This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics."

    "abstract": "Future direct-imaging missions, such as the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE), aim to observe thermal emission from potentially habitable planets to characterize their surface environments and search for signs of life. Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using one-dimensional models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature $\\sim 280$~K) as a benchmark, we compute three-dimensional atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10~bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics of global temperature contrast, the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but require integration a few times longer. These three-dimensional effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on one-dimensional models. We also assess their detectability for other nearby exoplanets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate three-dimensional atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions."

Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity. The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively."

    "abstract": "Understanding the growth of large cracks in brittle materials is the most fundamental problem in fracture mechanics. Under out-of-plane shear loading, an initially planar crack may fragment into multiple cracks, forming an echelon crack pattern. Explaining this phenomenon is essential for developing a general theory of crack growth. Although numerous empirical criteria have been proposed in the literature, none provide a unified explanation of all observed features and are largely restricted to two-dimensional growth in linear elastic isotropic materials. In this Letter, we confront a classical set of echelon crack growth experiments using two phase-field approaches: the classical variational model and a strength-constrained model. We show that, contrary to prevailing views, the variational model based solely on Griffith's energetic competition between elastic and fracture energies is fundamentally incomplete even for predicting the growth of large cracks. By incorporating a material strength surface that constrains the regions in which a crack can grow, the resulting model accurately predicts echelon crack growth without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about material or geometrical disorder. Results are presented for both soft and hard materials, confirming the model's general applicability to any brittle material. We further identify two governing non-dimensional parameters that control crack orientation and morphology and demonstrate that one of them, the ratio of shear to tensile strength, determines whether crack paths are more influenced by energy-based or stress-based empirical criteria, thereby reconciling these criteria within a single framework."

Compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D-PKs exhibit tunable photoluminescence, excitonic binding at room temperature and enhanced structural stability. However, the dynamics of photo-induced charge carriers and their transport properties are highly intertwined due to the interplay of diverse excitation species, charge carrier cooling, transport, and radiative and non-radiative recombination. In this study, we employ optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy (OPTP) to analyze the local conductivity dynamics of 2D and 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskites at timescales down to picoseconds. Remarkably, we observe an intensity-dependent, 2D-specific buildup of an ultrafast, few-picosecond decay in local conductivity. By combining OPTP with transient absorption (TA) and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), we demonstrate the disentanglement of photoconductivity and carrier population. This allows us to attribute the 2D-specific ultrafast THz response to delayed hot-carrier cooling and subsequent exciton formation, which effectively reduces the free-carrier conductivity. This intensity-dependent, ultrafast THz response is a signature of the recently identified hot-carrier bottleneck in 3D MAPI, and this effect manifests itself in a unique form in the 2D material. These results encourage further investigations on the impact of functional organic interlayers and provide insights into designing tunable carrier responses for ultrafast devices via adapted heterostructures and confinement."

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional moiré materials provide a versatile platform to explore phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have imaged the density-driven melting of generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) and Mott insulators (MIs) in electron-doped, near-60° twisted MoSe2 bilayers featuring a triangular moiré superlattice. We observe striking electron-hole asymmetry in GWC melting: hole-doped GWCs yield interaction-driven disordered states whereas electron-doped GWCs melt into delocalized liquid-like states. This asymmetry arises from the broken particle-hole symmetry of the moiré superlattice, which produces electron and hole Fermi pockets with different momentum geometries upon GWC condensation. MI states melt without such asymmetry, consistent with the absence of a symmetry-breaking density modulation. This work provides direct visualization of the novel emergent phases that appear as GWCs undergo quantum melting transitions."

Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we present a new high-sensitivity atomic-hydrogen (HI) observation toward the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 4278 and its adjacent region. From the observation, we found that external gas accretion from a neighbouring galaxy fuels the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278 through tidal interactions. The accreted gas entering NGC 4278 exhibits a rotating gas disk. And the accreted galaxy has been gas-poor and has an HI to stellar mass ratio of about 0.02. Due to the process of gas accretion, it is likely that relativistic jets are generated in the AGN of NGC 4278. The emission of TeV gamma rays in NGC 4278 is likely to be associated with the newly accreted HI gas."

    "abstract": "Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*."

Using the latest redshift-space distortion data, including DESI DR2 Full-Shape measurements, we constrain $M$ and $σ_8$ across three representative backgrounds: $Λ$CDM, an $H_0$-tension-reducing model, and a DESI-motivated dynamical dark energy scenario. In all cases, the square-root correction suppresses growth and can reconcile $σ_8$ with Planck at the $1σ$ level, with the strongest improvement occurring in the $H_0$-tension-oriented background. A residual degeneracy between $M$ and $σ_8$ remains, indicating that future multi-probe analyses combining lensing and full-shape clustering will be required to determine whether the $\\sqrt{Q}$ term represents a genuine signal of modified gravity."

A recent statistical study of the N-emitter population has quantified the frequency $f_N$ of these rare objects and their redshift evolution (Morel et al. 2025). Using these results we here test if N-emitters trace the formation of GCs and use the observed cosmic star-formation rate density evolution to predict the cosmological evolution of the GC population with time, their age distribution, and the total present-day stellar mass density formed in globulars. The predicted age distribution of GCs strongly resembles the typical asymmetric observed distributions in the Galaxy and ellipiticals, with a peak at $\\sim 11.5-12$ Gyr and a longer tail extending to younger ages. We derive a total stellar mass density formed in N-emitters down to redshift zero of $(2-7) \\times 10^5$ M$_{\\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, which matches within a factor $\\sim 2$ the observed fraction of stellar mass found in the GC population at $z=0$. These results provide additional indirect arguments supporting the hypothesis that N-emitters could represent sign-posts of a short phase of GC formation."

    "abstract": "The observations of B1237+25 at a frequency of 111 MHz were analyzed. For the first time in the normal radiation mode a new component in the central region in the average profile was detected. This component is manifested in all modes of pulsar emission: quiet-normal (QN), flare-normal (FN) and in the abnormal mode (AB). The subpulse drift is observed in the QN mode only in the first and last components of the average profile. The normal mode is interrupted by nullings and transitions into the abnormal AB mode. In the AB mode, the structure at the edge of the outer cone is destroyed, the distance between the inner and outer cones is almost doubled, and the distance between the inner cone and the central region is reduced.Analysis of our data has shown that the components of the outer and inner cones of the average profile are formed by an ordinary mode of radio emission (O-mode) and form a single cone radiation of the pulsar. The central components of the average profile (wide and narrow) are formed by an extraordinary mode (X-mode). Estimates of the height of the radiation output from the central region (X-mode) and the cone radiation (O-mode) are obtained: 80~km and 370~km, respectively. A microstructure with a time scale of $τ_μ\\le0.5$~$μs$ has been detected. This time scale corresponds well to the time of the development of a spark discharge in the polar cap. For this value $τ_μ$, the height of the vacuum gap should be $h_p\\le750$~cm. Based on the steepness of the individual pulse's trailing edge at the longitude of the first component, a limit was obtained on the value of the $γ$ factor of the relativistic secondary plasma: $γ\\ge$260. The dependence of the distance between the components of the outer and inner cone of radiation on the frequency is the same and corresponds to a power law with an exponent of -0.16."

Our results unify and extend several approaches to amenability for noncommutative dynamical systems. As applications of our methods, we prove that amenability of Fell bundles passes to restrictions to subgroups and that a Fell bundle over a group $G$ is amenable if and only if both its restriction to a normal subgroup $H \\trianglelefteq G$ and the associated quotient Fell bundle over $G/H$ are amenable. This provides a powerful structural tool that extends classical permanence results for group amenability to the setting of \\Wstar Fell bundles and also \\cstar algebraic Fell bundles. We also discuss how Fell bundles and their amenability interact with group coactions on $C^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras."

    "abstract": "Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems."

However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL."

We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics."

    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER."

In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA."

    "abstract": "Temporal sequences of terrains arise in various application areas. To analyze them efficiently, one generally needs a suitable abstraction of the data as well as a method to compare and match them over time. In this paper we consider merge trees as a topological descriptor for terrains and the interleaving distance as a method to match and compare them. An interleaving between two merge trees consists of two maps, one in each direction. These maps must satisfy ancestor relations and hence introduce a ''shift'' between points and their image. An optimal interleaving minimizes the maximum shift; the interleaving distance is the value of this shift. However, to study the evolution of merge trees over time, we need not only a number but also a meaningful matching between the two trees. The two maps of an optimal interleaving induce a matching, but due to the bottleneck nature of the interleaving distance, this matching fails to capture local similarities between the trees. In this paper we hence propose a notion of local optimality for interleavings. To do so, we define the residual interleaving distance, a generalization of the interleaving distance that allows additional constraints on the maps. This allows us to define locally correct interleavings, which use a range of shifts across the two merge trees that reflect the local similarity well. We give a constructive proof that a locally correct interleaving always exists."

    "abstract": "Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs."

Dynamic prediction models that leverage longitudinal biomarkers may improve risk stratification over traditional static models. This study aims to develop and validate a joint model (JM) using longitudinal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements to predict the risk of rehospitalization or death in HF patients. We analyzed real-world data from the TriNetX database, including patients with an incident HF diagnosis between 2016 and 2022. The final selected cohort included 1,804 patients. A Bayesian joint modeling framework was developed to link patient-specific NT-proBNP trajectories to the risk of a composite endpoint (HF rehospitalization or all-cause mortality) within a 180-day window following hospital discharge. The model's performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and assessed with the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and Integrated Calibration Index (ICI). The joint model demonstrated a strong predictive advantage over a benchmark static model, particularly when making updated predictions at later time points (180-360 days). A joint model trained on patients with more frequent NT-proBNP measurements achieved the highest accuracy. The main joint model showed excellent calibration, suggesting its risk estimates are reliable. These findings suggest that modeling the full trajectory of NT-proBNP with a joint modeling framework enables more accurate and dynamic risk assessment compared to static, single-timepoint methods. This approach supports the development of adaptive clinical decision-support tools for personalized HF management."

Within this framework, we define two portfolio-level quantities, Informational Return and Governance-Adjusted Risk, whose interaction characterizes data mixtures and generates a Governance-Efficient Frontier. Regulators shape this frontier through risk caps, admissible categories, and weight bands that translate fairness, privacy, robustness, and provenance requirements into measurable constraints on data allocation while preserving model flexibility. A telecommunications illustration shows how different AI services require distinct portfolios within a common governance structure. The framework offers a familiar portfolio logic as an input-level explanation layer suited to the large-scale deployment of AI systems."

Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks.

    "abstract": "Twisted MoTe$_2$ hosts intriguing correlated quantum phenomena including the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted bilayer (t-BL) MoTe$_2$ near 3.7$^\\circ$, which is sensitive to the twist angle and moiré superlattices. Here, we directly visualize the twist-angle-modulated electronic structure of t-BL and twisted double-bilayer (t-DBL) near this critical angle. We find that the moiré superlattice not only modifies the relative energy between $Γ$ and K valleys in t-BL MoTe$_2$, but also strongly reconstructs the $Γ$ valley for both t-BL and t-DBL. Specifically, the deep $p_z$-derived band at $Γ$ exhibits a distinct splitting that systematically varies with increasing twist angle. Theoretical analysis suggests that this modulation arises from the twist-angle-dependent lattice relaxation, especially interfacial corrugations. Our work directly visualizes the moiré-modulated electronic structure and provides key spectroscopic information of lattice relaxation and interlayer interactions underlying the physics of twisted MoTe$_2$."

In this work, we employ the configuration interaction method to calculate the A constants for several low-lying levels in Tm II, with the random-phase-approximation corrections also taken into account. Our results show good agreement with the new experimental data and provide reliable predictions for additional states where measurements are not yet available."

    "abstract": "Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks."

    "abstract": "The scattering of electromagnetic waves by subwavelength rectangular grooves has been extensively studied, yet its physical interpretation has largely relied on field-intensity distri- butions. Here we demonstrate that the transition from concave to convex scattering profiles observed as the groove width approaches the wavelength is governed by a topological reorga- nization of the near-field energy flow. Using a rigorous modal formulation for TM-polarized fields, we analyze the complex electromagnetic field and the associated time-averaged Poynt- ing vector. We show that reducing the groove width induces the creation, migration, and annihilation of Poynting-vector singularities, including vortices and saddle points, leading to a qualitative restructuring of electromagnetic energy transport. This topological transition redirects the local energy flux and manifests as a convex scattering profile in the far field. The results establish a direct link between near-field energy topology and far-field scattering, providing a unified physical interpretation of subwavelength groove scattering."

We propose Self-Referential Graph HyperNetworks, systems where the very machinery of variation and inheritance is embedded within the network.

Through new reinforcement learning benchmarks with environmental shifts (CartPoleSwitch, LunarLander-Switch), Self-Referential GHNs show swift, reliable adaptation and emergent population dynamics. In the locomotion benchmark Ant-v5, they evolve coherent gaits, showing promising fine-tuning capabilities by autonomously decreasing variation in the population to concentrate around promising solutions. Our findings support the idea that evolvability itself can emerge from neural self-reference. Self-Referential GHNs reflect a step toward synthetic systems that more closely mirror biological evolution, offering tools for autonomous, open-ended learning agents."

    "abstract": "We propose a quantum circuit design for implementing coined quantum walks on complex networks. In complex networks, the coin and shift operators depend on the varying degrees of the nodes, which makes circuit construction more challenging than for regular graphs. To address this issue, we use a dual-register encoding. This approach enables a simplified shift operator and reduces the resource overhead compared to previous methods. We implement the circuit using Qmod, a high-level quantum programming language, and evaluated the performance through numerical simulations on Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabási-Albert models. The results show that the circuit depth scales as approximately $N^{1.9}$ regardless of the network topology. Furthermore, we execute the proposed circuits on the ibm\\_torino superconducting quantum processor for Watts-Strogatz models with $N=4$ and $N=8$. The experiments show that hardware-aware optimization slightly improved the $L_1$ distance for the larger graph, whereas connectivity constraints imposed overhead for the smaller one. These results indicate that while current NISQ devices are limited to small-scale validations, the polynomial scaling of our framework makes it suitable for larger-scale implementations in the early fault-tolerant quantum computing era."

We analyse the resulting weighted, directed, and signed network using a Bayesian stochastic block model framework, which enables the inference of group structure without imposing prior assumptions on the role of negative or asymmetric ties. While a full model incorporating all edge attributes yields statistically coherent clusters, these do not align with socially meaningful communities. To address this, we focus first on the network backbone of mutual affinities, and we characterize its group organization. Many communities display an assortative structure, often embedded within larger cohesive configurations, but we also observe more diverse patterns such as core-periphery structure and isolated nodes. We then examine how relationship intensity, directionality, and conflict shape group structure. Asymmetric ties, though often occurring between communities, are frequently present within them, revealing the stabilizing effect of group membership on non-mutual relationships. Furthermore, the presence of asymmetric ties does not inherently imply a hierarchical structure, given that all groups both receive and report significant levels of non-reciprocal ties. More intense ties play a disproportionate role in shaping community structure. Finally, negative ties tend to bridge communities, but we find that groups feature a significant level of internal conflict. Our research offers a new perspective on the study of group organization when rich information about the directionality, the intensity and the sign of ties is considered, with implications for identifying social vulnerability and designing targeted interventions."

We conducted a systematic review of 44 peer-reviewed studies published between 2004 and 2024 using a five-phase screening pipeline. From each study, we extracted data on study design, IoT type, SPAU measures, and identified research gaps. We introduce the SPAU-IoT Framework, which comprises 27 criteria across four dimensions: security (e.g., resilience to cyber threats, secure authentication, encrypted communication, secure-by-default settings, and guardianship features), privacy (e.g., data minimization, explicit consent, and privacy-preserving analytics), accessibility (e.g., compliance with ADA/WCAG standards and assistive-technology compatibility), and usability (e.g., guided interaction, integrated assistance, and progressive learning). Applying this framework revealed that more than 70% of studies implemented authentication and encryption mechanisms, whereas fewer than 50% addressed accessibility or usability concerns. We further developed a threat model that maps IoT assets, networks, and backend servers to exploit vectors such as phishing, caregiver exploitation, and weak-password attacks, explicitly accounting for age-related vulnerabilities including cognitive decline and sensory impairment. Our results expose a systemic lack of integrated SPAU approaches in existing IoT research and translate these gaps into actionable, standards-aligned design guidelines for IoT systems designed for older adults."

Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques."

NIKA comprises hundreds of curated network incidents, spanning five network scenarios, from data centers to ISP networks, and covers 54 representative network issues. Lastly, NIKA is modular and extensible by design, offering APIs to facilitate the integration of new network scenarios and failure cases.

Our primary focus is on the role of conformal Ward identities in fully characterizing parity-odd interactions associated with chiral and conformal anomalies in momentum space. Furthermore, we explore mechanisms that lead to the breaking of conformal invariance, such as finite-temperature and finite-density effects or the presence of a fermion mass, and examine how parity-odd anomalous interactions behave under these conditions. By analyzing these phenomena through the lens of conformal and thermal field theories, we obtain deeper insights into their mathematical structure and their significance across a wide range of physical contexts."

The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved."

    "abstract": "Interacting bosons in optical lattices directly expose quantum phases in a clean, highly controllable environment. This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures."

    "abstract": "We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy."

We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed."

To compare the results with a typical parametric approach of extrapolation and observed survival from a later datacut. Methods Data were pooled from three phase I/II open-label trials evaluating larotrectinib in 196 patients with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase fusion-positive (NTRK+) solid tumours followed up until July 2021. Bayesian joint modelling was used to obtain patient-specific predictions of OS using individual-level sum of diameter of target lesions (SLD) profiles up to the time at which the patient died or was censored. Overall and tumour site-specific estimates were produced, assuming a common, exchangeable, or independent association structure across tumour sites. Results The overall risk of mortality was 9% higher per 10mm increase in SLD (HR 1.09, 95% CrI 1.05 to 1.14) for all tumour sites combined. Tumour-specific point estimates of restricted mean , median and landmark survival were more similar across models for larger tumour groups, compared to smaller tumour groups. In general, parameters were estimated with more certainty compared to a standard Weibull model and were aligned with the more recent datacut. Conclusions Joint modelling using intermediate outcomes such as tumour burden can offer an alternative approach to traditional survival modelling and may improve survival predictions from limited follow-up data. This approach allows complex hierarchical data structures, such as patients nested within tumour types, and can also incorporate multiple longitudinal biomarkers in a multivariate modelling framework."

    "abstract": "Background: Compilers are fundamental to software development, translating high-level source code into executable software systems. Faults in compilers can have severe consequences and thus effective localization and resolution of compiler bugs are crucial. Problem: In practice, developers often examine version history to identify and investigate bug-inducing commit (BIC) for fixing bugs. However, while numerous sophisticated Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) techniques have been proposed for compiler fault isolation, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against the BIC-based strategies widely adopted in practice. Objective: This study aims to bridge this gap by directly comparing a BIC-based strategy, Basic, with representative SBFL techniques in the context of compiler fault localization. The BIC-based strategy closely aligns with common developer practices, as it directly identifies the BIC and treats the files modified in that commit as faulty candidates. Method: The Basic identifies the most recent good release and earliest bad release, and then employs a binary search to pinpoint the bug-inducing commit. All files modified in the identified commit are flagged as potentially faulty. We rigorously compare Basic against SBFL-based techniques using a benchmark consisting of 60 GCC bugs and 60 LLVM bugs. Result: Our analysis reveals that Basic performs comparably to, and in many cases outperforms, state-of-the-art SBFL-based techniques, particularly on the critical Top-1 and Top-5 ranking metrics. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the practical effectiveness of SBFL-based techniques in real-world compiler debugging scenarios. We recommend that future research adopt Basic as a baseline when developing and evaluating new compiler fault isolation methods."

    "abstract": "Event-by-event fluctuations of the baryon number, which is mostly carried by protons and neutrons, in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a sensitive probe for locating the conjectured critical point in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram. Since current experiments have limited access to neutron fluctuations because detectors are largely insensitive to neutrons, measurements of (net-)proton fluctuations are often used as a proxy for (net-)baryon number fluctuations. Although direct measurements of neutron fluctuations are challenging, their information are encoded in the production and correlations of light nuclei, when they are formed through coalescence of nucleons at kinetic freeze-out. Here, we propose to unfold neutron fluctuations from correlations among light nuclei produced in heavy-ion collisions. Model calculations validate this approach and show that baryon number fluctuations can be unfolded up to the third order. For fourth and higher-order cumulants, however, the uncertainties become sizable, indicating that further methodological developments and refinements are required."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes four new methods to decontaminate spectra of stars and galaxies resulting from slitless spectroscopy used in many space missions such as Euclid. These methods are based on two distinct approaches and simultaneously take into account multiple dispersion directions of light. The first approach, called the local instantaneous approach, is based on an approximate linear instantaneous model. The second approach, called the local convolutive approach, is based on a more realistic convolutive model that allows simultaneous decontamination and deconvolution of spectra. For each approach, a mixing model was developed that links the observed data to the source spectra. This was done either in the spatial domain for the local instantaneous approach or in the Fourier domain for the local convolutive approach. Four methods were then developed to decontaminate these spectra from the mixtures, exploiting the direct images provided by photometers. Test results obtained using realistic, noisy, Euclid-like data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

    "abstract": "Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\\sim{10^{6}~\\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\\sim{10~\\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$α$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\\sim10^{32}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\\sim10^{31}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\\%, 8\\%, and 18\\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$α$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA."

    "abstract": "Driven by Large Language Models, the single-agent, multi-tool architecture has become a popular paradigm for autonomous agents due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, this architecture also introduces a new and severe privacy risk, which we term Tools Orchestration Privacy Risk (TOP-R), where an agent, to achieve a benign user goal, autonomously aggregates information fragments across multiple tools and leverages its reasoning capabilities to synthesize unexpected sensitive information. We provide the first systematic study of this risk. First, we establish a formal framework, attributing the risk's root cause to the agent's misaligned objective function: an overoptimization for helpfulness while neglecting privacy awareness. Second, we construct TOP-Bench, comprising paired leakage and benign scenarios, to comprehensively evaluate this risk. To quantify the trade-off between safety and robustness, we introduce the H-Score as a holistic metric. The evaluation results reveal that TOP-R is a severe risk: the average Risk Leakage Rate (RLR) of eight representative models reaches 90.24%, while the average H-Score is merely 0.167, with no model exceeding 0.3. Finally, we propose the Privacy Enhancement Principle (PEP) method, which effectively mitigates TOP-R, reducing the Risk Leakage Rate to 46.58% and significantly improving the H-Score to 0.624. Our work reveals both a new class of risk and inherent structural limitations in current agent architectures, while also offering feasible mitigation strategies."

They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes."

However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components."

By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \\textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \\textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality.

Software model checking has been successfully applied to check interface specifications in application programs, but its employment in industrial practice is hindered by its unpredictability (whether it succeeds for a given application program or not). In this paper, we present a novel approach to address this problem by checking the HAL interface specification continuously and right from the start of the development. I.e., we develop an embedded application in several iterations without a formal connection between the steps. The steps start from a program skeleton which does nothing but calling HAL functions. Actual functionality is added consecutively. The HAL interface specification is checked in each step of the sequence. The idea of the approach is to exploit a specific feature of software model checking: Its attempt to compute exactly the abstraction that is needed for the check to succeed may carry over from one step to the next, even if there is no formal connection between the steps. The experience from a preliminary experimental evaluation of our approach in the development of embedded applications is very promising. Following our approach, the check succeeds in each step and in particular in the final application program."

    "abstract": "Molecular crystals possess a highly complex crystallographic landscape which in many cases results in the experimental observation of multiple crystal structures for the same compound. Accurate results can often be obtained for such systems by employing periodic density functional theory using hybrid functionals; however, this is not always computationally feasible. One possibility to circumvent these expensive periodic calculations is the utilization of multimer embedding methods. Therein, the fully periodic crystal is described at a lower level of theory, and subsequently monomer energies, dimer interaction energies, etc. are corrected via high-level calculations. In this paper, we further extend such a multimer embedding approach by one multimer order for all investigated properties, allowing us to compute lattice energies up to the tetramer embedding level, and atomic forces, the stress tensor, and harmonic phonons up to the trimer level. We test the significance of including these higher-order multimers by embedding PBE0+MBD multimers into periodic PBE+MBD calculations utilizing the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals and comparing the results to explicit periodic PBE0+MBD calculations. We show that tetramer interactions systematically improve the lattice energy approximation and explore multiple possibilities for multimer selection. Furthermore, we confirm that trimer interactions are crucial for the description of the stress tensor, yielding cell volumes within 1 % of those of PBE0+MBD. Subsequently, this also results in an improvement of the description of vibrational properties, giving on average gamma point frequencies within 1.3 wave numbers and vibrational free energies within 0.3 kJ/mol of the PBE0+MBD results."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding confidence ellipsoids for an arbitrary distribution in high dimensions. Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $α$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\\Pr_{D}[E] \\ge 1-α$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $β$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $β$? Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(β^{γd})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $β$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(α/γ)$ probability mass for any $γ< α$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation guarantees on worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem."

    "abstract": "Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings."

We establish the universal representation property for a natural class of spike train functions. Our results are fully quantitative, constructive, and near-optimal in the number of required weights and neurons. The analysis reveals that SNNs are particularly well-suited to represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. The latter is of particular interest, as it indicates that deep SNNs can efficiently capture composite functions via a modular design. As an application of our results, we discuss spike train classification. Overall, these results contribute to a rigorous foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of spike-based neuromorphic systems."

As the Stark field strength increases, long-time magic and entanglement consistently signal a crossover from ergodic to constrained localized dynamics. These results establish nonstabilizerness (``magic'') as a practical complexity probe for disorder-free ergodicity breaking and constrained localization, with direct relevance to benchmarking and designing near-term quantum simulators, and fill a gap in the understanding of nonstabilizerness in disorder-free many-body localization."

The individual compliance effect captures the portion of the treatment effect attributable to changes in treatment receipt, while the network assignment effect reflects the pure impact of treatment assignment and spillover among individuals within the same cluster. Unlike prior efforts which either empirically identify or interval identify these estimands, we characterize new structural assumptions for nonparametric point identification. We then develop semiparametrically efficient estimators that combine data-adaptive machine learning methods with efficient influence functions to enable more robust inference.

Using administrative court records from 2020 to 2024, the analysis focuses on cases in which arrests did not occur immediately, allowing for systematic variation in procedural delay. The study asks whether longer delays are linked to more severe punishments and whether these associations differ across offense types and institutional contexts during periods of court disruption. The findings indicate that longer delays are consistently associated with harsher sentencing outcomes, even after accounting for demographic characteristics, case complexity, offense category, and pandemic-related disruptions. These associations are particularly pronounced in violent and sexual exploitation cases. While the analysis does not establish causal effects, the consistency of results across multiple empirical approaches suggests that procedural timing is a meaningful feature of judicial decision-making rather than a neutral administrative artifact. By documenting how institutional delays correlate with punishment severity, this study contributes to empirical research on judicial discretion, court efficiency, and inequality in the administration of justice, highlighting the importance of procedural fairness alongside formal legal criteria."

However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\\simeq λ_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $λ_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $π$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($λ_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system."

Moreover, substantial heterogeneity may exist across sites, and locally identified latent classes may not be comparable across sites. We propose a unified modeling framework where a common definition of the latent classes is shared across sites and heterogeneous mixing proportions of latent classes are allowed to account for between-site heterogeneity. To fit the heterogeneous mixture model on multi-site data, we propose a novel distributed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm where at each iteration a density ratio tilted surrogate Q function is constructed to approximate the standard Q function of the EM algorithm as if the data from multiple sites could be pooled together. Theoretical analysis shows that our estimator achieves the same contraction property as the estimators derived from the EM algorithm based on the pooled data."

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of traffic management and vehicle surveillance, efficient license plate detection and recognition are indispensable. Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions. An optimized pipeline, utilizing YOLOv8 Nano for LPR and YOLOv8 Small for Character Recognition, is proposed. This configuration not only maintains computational efficiency but also ensures high accuracy, establishing a robust foundation for future real-world deployments on edge devices within Intelligent Transportation Systems. This effort marks a significant stride towards the development of smarter and more efficient urban infrastructures."

    "abstract": "Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis."

We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations."

This paper introduces an alternative perspective for testing counterfactual fairness in LLMs, proposing a structured and intent-aware framework coined CAFFE (Counterfactual Assessment Framework for Fairness Evaluation). Inspired by traditional non-functional testing, CAFFE (1) formalizes LLM-Fairness test cases through explicitly defined components, including prompt intent, conversational context, input variants, expected fairness thresholds, and test environment configuration, (2) assists testers by automatically generating targeted test data, and (3) evaluates model responses using semantic similarity metrics. Our experiments, conducted on three different architectural families of LLM, demonstrate that CAFFE achieves broader bias coverage and more reliable detection of unfair behavior than existing metamorphic approaches."

GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories.

To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity."

It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities.

The first dynamical system formulation applied to the toy NMDC model, although able to identify several invariant submanifolds, fails to fully investigate the fixed point structure, as all the fixed points turn out to be non-hyperbolic. We, however, discover an interesting feature that the qualitative dynamics are independent of the coupling strength between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field derivative. The second dynamical system formulation applied to the mixed $R^2$-Higgs inflation model performs much better, being able to correctly reduce to the individual phase spaces of the $R^2$ and Higgs inflation separately in special cases, as well as correctly delivering the expected invariant submanifolds and fixed points. For the mixed $R^2$-Higgs case, illustrative phase portraits are provided for a somewhat better understanding of the dynamics."

It is more sample efficient than alternatives due to its ability to make use of prior information about the integrand through a Gaussian process. We show this through theory, deriving a convergence rate significantly faster than Monte Carlo in a broad range of settings. We also demonstrate empirically that our proposed method does indeed require fewer samples on several synthetic settings as well as for parameter estimation for Conway-Maxwell-Poisson and Potts models."

Using this criterion, we uncover several new features of multi-qubit magic distillation and detection. We prove that genuinely multi-qubit magic distillation protocols are strictly more powerful than all single-qubit schemes by showing that the Triangle Criterion is not stable under tensor products, in sharp contrast to the PPT criterion. Moreover, we show that, with overwhelming probability, multi-qubit magic states with relatively low rank cannot be distilled by any single-qubit distillation protocol. We derive an upper bound on the minimal purity of magic states, which is conjectured to be tight with both numerical and constructive evidences. Using this minimal-purity result, we predict the existence of unfaithful magic states, namely states that cannot be detected by any fidelity-based magic witness, and reveal fundamental limitations of mixed-state magic detection in any single-copy scheme."

While higher-order (many-body) interactions have recently emerged as a powerful framework for capturing collective behaviors, real-world examples regarding dynamics remain scarce. Here, we show that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from time-delayed pairwise coupling in Kuramoto oscillators. By expanding the delay term up to second order in the coupling strength, we derive an effective Kuramoto model featuring both two-body and three-body interactions, but without delay, hence, easier to be analyzed. Numerical simulations show that this reduced model can reproduce the bistability and synchronization transitions of the original time-delayed system. Furthermore, applying the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we obtain a stability diagram for incoherent and synchronized states that closely matches the results of the original model. Our findings reveal that time delays can be effectively recast in the form of higher-order interactions, offering a new perspective on how delayed interactions shape the dynamics."

This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments."

    "abstract": "In gauge theories, globally charged observables necessarily depend non-locally on the kinematical fields, with this dependence extending to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime. Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity."

    "abstract": "The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments."

    "abstract": "With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton."

Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components."

    "abstract": "Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems."

    "abstract": "Topological textures in magnetically ordered materials are important case studies for fundamental research with promising applications in data science. They can also serve as photonic elements to mold electromagnetic fields endowing them with features inherent to the spin order, as demonstrated analytically and numerically in this work. A self-consistent theory is developed for the interaction of spatially structured electromagnetic fields with non-collinear, topologically non-trivial spin textures. A tractable numerical method is designed and implemented for the calculation of the formed magnetic/photonic textures in the entire simulation space. Numerical illustrations are presented for scattering from point-like singularities, i.e. Bloch points, in the magnetization vector fields, evidencing that the geometry and topology of the magnetic order results in photonic fields that embody orbital angular momentum, chirality as well as magnetoelectric densities. Features of the scattered fields can serve as a fingerprint for the underlying magnetic texture and its dynamics. The findings point to the potential of topological magnetic textures as a route to molding photonic fields."

This article presents a systematic PRISMA-based review of OP research published between 2017 and 2025, with a focus on models and methods that have shaped subsequent developments in the field. We introduce a component-based taxonomy that decomposes OP variants into time-, path-, node-, structure-, and information-based extensions. This framework unifies classical and emerging variants -- including stochastic, time-dependent, Dubins, Set, and multi-period OPs -- within a single structural perspective. We further categorize solution approaches into exact algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics, and learning-based methods, with particular emphasis on matheuristics and recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and neural networks, which enhance scalability in large-scale and information-rich settings. Building on this unified view, we discuss how different components affect computational complexity and polyhedral properties and identify open challenges related to robustness, sustainability, and AI integration. The survey thus provides both a consolidated reference for existing OP research and a structured agenda for future theoretical and applied work."

    "abstract": "Gravity is generally expected to violate global symmetries, including lepton number. However, neutrino masses from the Planck-suppressed Weinberg operator are typically too small to account for oscillation data. We propose a new model-building approach to low-scale neutrino mass generation, in which an intermediate spontaneous symmetry-breaking scale generates masses and mixings in the heavy neutral lepton (HNL) sector, while leaving an unbroken residual symmetry $G_{\\mathrm{res}}$ that forbids light-neutrino masses. The observed light-neutrino masses then arise because gravity breaks $G_{\\mathrm{res}}$ via Planck-suppressed operators, inducing the small lepton-number violation required in low-scale seesaw constructions. The HNLs form pseudo-Dirac pairs, with masses potentially within reach of future colliders and complementary tests in precision searches such as charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV). As an illustration, we present a representative realisation of this class of models and show that, for $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operator coefficients, it predicts a region in the ($M_R$, $Θ^2$)-plane that can be testable via displaced-vertex searches at the High-Luminosity (HL) LHC and the FCC-ee."

For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology."

(..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries. The BeppoSAX-WFC FXT sample is found to be consistent with the one observed by Einstein Probe, when the sensitivity of the two instruments is taken into account."

By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions."

In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages."

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments."

The modified expansion history and the entropy injection at reheating, can affect the final energy fraction of dark matter. In this paper, we revisit the calculation of the freeze-out and freeze-in dynamics, showing additional effects on top of the standard dilution factor if the dark matter production is completed during the supercooling stage. We show for the first time how these effects can be particularly interesting for direct detection, as the parameter space for WIMP-like candidates shifts from excluded to allowed regions, and freeze-in candidates get closer to experimental reach. A phenomenological motivation to consider supercooling is the associated gravitational wave background. The implications of a finite-duration reheating stage, when the equation of state is close to matter-domination, are a peculiar low-frequency spectrum, and its shift to lower frequencies. These effects are a complementary test of the dynamics that we study for dark matter production, and remarkably can link direct detection of dark matter and gravitational wave astronomy."

While prior black-box MIA techniques rely on confidence scores or token likelihoods, these signals are often entangled with a sample's intrinsic properties - such as content difficulty or rarity - leading to poor generalization and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose ICP-MIA, a novel MIA framework grounded in the theory of training dynamics, particularly the phenomenon of diminishing returns during optimization. We introduce the Optimization Gap as a fundamental signal of membership: at convergence, member samples exhibit minimal remaining loss-reduction potential, while non-members retain significant potential for further optimization. To estimate this gap in a black-box setting, we propose In-Context Probing (ICP), a training-free method that simulates fine-tuning-like behavior via strategically constructed input contexts. We propose two probing strategies: reference-data-based (using semantically similar public samples) and self-perturbation (via masking or generation). Experiments on three tasks and multiple LLMs show that ICP-MIA significantly outperforms prior black-box MIAs, particularly at low false positive rates. We further analyze how reference data alignment, model type, PEFT configurations, and training schedules affect attack effectiveness. Our findings establish ICP-MIA as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for auditing privacy risks in deployed LLMs."

Recently, it is found that suitably tailored time-dependent scattering can excite these complex modes and suppress the reflected signal for the entire duration of the process, a phenomenon referred to as virtual absorption. Motivated by this, we present the study of the spectrum stability of TTMs using pseudospectrum and condition numbers. We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes. A notable exception is a purely imaginary TTM whose pseudospectrum's contours are nearly concentric and whose condition number is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the overtones, indicating enhanced spectral stability. Additionally, we confirm that purely imaginary TTMs occur only for spin $s=2$, whereas genuinely complex TTM families appear only in sufficiently high dimensions, $d \\geqslant 8$, extending earlier claims that placed the onset at $d \\geqslant 10$."

This study presents a first attempt to develop a bottom-up regional building energy model based on prototype buildings simulated in EnergyPlus, to assess space heating and cooling loads of urban and rural residential buildings across 30 Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2024. The results indicate that: (1) Guangdong recorded the highest cooling loads in 2020, reaching 76.5 TWh/a in urban areas and 63.0 TWh/a in rural areas; Henan exhibited the highest rural heating load at 174.6 TWh/a, while urban heating loads were highest in provinces such as Liaoning and Shandong. (2) From 1980 to 2024, average cooling loads increased from 12.4 to 15.1 kWh/m2/a in urban areas but declined from 22.63 to 19.87 kWh/m2/a in rural areas. Over the same period, average heating loads decreased from 44.08 to 39.92 kWh/m2/a in urban areas and from 100.15 to 72.42 kWh/m2/a in rural areas. (3) Urban residential building stock has surpassed rural stock in 22 provinces in recent years, compared with only 4 provinces in 2000, and the presence of 12 urban energy-efficiency standards versus only one rural standard further highlights substantial envelope performance gaps. Collectively, these dynamics have led to pronounced and persistent urban-rural disparities in residential heating and cooling loads. These findings underscore the need for differentiated standards and region-specific clean heating strategies, while providing a transferable modeling framework to inform targeted energy-saving policies and support the building sector's transition toward carbon neutrality."

In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_γ$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy."

Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras.

In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals.

    "abstract": "We introduce a continuous analog of the Fourier ratio for compactly supported Borel measures. For a measure \\(μ\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) and \\(f\\in L^2(μ)\\), the Fourier ratio compares \\(L^1\\) and \\(L^2\\) norms of a regularized Fourier transform at scale \\(R\\). We develop a fractal uncertainty principle giving sharp two-sided bounds in terms of covering numbers of spatial and frequency supports, with applications to exact signal recovery. We show that small Fourier ratio implies efficient approximation by low-degree trigonometric polynomials in \\(L^1\\), \\(L^2\\), and \\(L^\\infty\\). In contrast, restriction estimates reveal a sharp gap between curved measures and random fractal measures, yielding strong lower bounds on approximation degree. Applications to convex surface measures are also obtained."

    "abstract": "We present a spin-dependent extension of the non-orthogonal generalized Wannier function (NGWF) formalism within the framework of linear-scaling density functional theory (LS-DFT) as implemented in the ONETEP code. In traditional LS-DFT representations, both spin channels are constrained to share a common variational basis, which limits the accuracy for systems that are spin-polarized or exhibit magnetic order. Our approach allows NGWFs to vary independently for each spin channel, enabling a more accurate representation of spin-polarization in the electronic density. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method through a series of test cases, including localized magnetic defects in two-dimensional hBN, transition metal complexes, two-dimensional van der Waals magnetic materials, and both bulk and nanocluster ferromagnetic Co. In each scenario, the incorporation of spin-dependent NGWFs results in enhanced accuracy for total energy calculations, improved localization of spin density, and accurate predictions of magnetic ground states. This improvement is particularly notable when combined with DFT+U and DFT+U+J corrections. In this work, we take the opportunity to describe the combination of DFT+U+J and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) formalism within the LS-DFT framework, including how PAW participates in the ionic Pulay force, and in the minimum-tracking linear response approach for computing parameters in situ. Our findings demonstrate that spin-dependent NGWFs are a crucial and computationally efficient advancement in the linear-scaling DFT simulation of spin-polarized materials."

At low bitrates, TreeNet achieves an average improvement of 4.83% in BD-rate over JPEG AI, while reducing model complexity by 87.82%.

A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care."

    "abstract": "Conjugated organic molecules play a central role in a wide range of optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells. A major bottleneck in the computational design of these materials is the discrepancy between simulation and experimental time and length scales. Coarse-graining (CG) offers a promising solution to bridge this gap by reducing redundant degrees of freedom and smoothing the potential energy landscape, thereby significantly accelerating molecular dynamics simulations. However, standard CG models are typically parameterized from homogeneous bulk simulations and assume density-independent effective interactions. As a consequence, they often fail to replicate inhomogeneous systems, such as (free-standing) thin films, due to an incorrect representation of liquid-vacuum interfacial properties. In this work, we develop a CG parametrization strategy that incorporates local-density-dependent potentials to capture material heterogeneities. We evaluate the methodology by simulating free-standing films and comparing interfacial orientational order parameters between all-atom and CG simulations. The resulting CG models accurately reproduce bulk densities and radial distribution functions as well as molecular orientations at the liquid-vacuum interface. This work paves the way for reliable, computation-driven predictions of atomically resolved interfacial ordering in organic molecular systems."

Typical mechanical metamaterials mimic crystal structures with close-packed lattices, exhibit high structural stiffness but suffer from reduced flexibility and abrupt fracture similar to atomic debonding.

By combining the metamaterial programmability with polymer-like mechanics, we also program crosslinking, proto-crystalline order, and entanglements of free chains to enable polymeric functional programmability of the metamaterials on the macroscale. This macroscale polymeric programmability not only allows synthetic, nature-inspired strengthening combinations that are unattainable in microscale polymer networks, but also turns polymer-inspired metamaterials into a programmable experimental platform for exploring new deformation strengthening strategies, opening pathways to functional applications such as soft, humanoid-like tissues for robotic joints and compliant connectors."

This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade."

    "abstract": "We propose a pressure-robust enriched Galerkin (EG) finite element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes and heat equations in the Boussinesq regime. For the Navier-Stokes equations, the EG formulation combines continuous Lagrange elements with a discontinuous enrichment vector per element in the velocity space and a piecewise constant pressure space, and it can be implemented efficiently within standard finite element frameworks. To enforce pressure robustness, we construct velocity reconstruction operators that map the discrete EG velocity field into exactly divergence-free, H(div)-conforming fields. In particular, we develop reconstructions based on Arbogast-Correa (AC) mixed finite element spaces on quadrilateral meshes and demonstrate that the resulting schemes remain stable and accurate even on highly distorted grids. The nonlinearity of the coupled Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq system is treated with several iterative strategies, including Picard iterations and Anderson-accelerated iterations; our numerical study shows that Anderson acceleration yields robust and efficient convergence for high Rayleigh number flows within the proposed framework. The performance of the method is assessed on a set of benchmark problems and application-driven test cases. These numerical experiments highlight the potential of pressure-robust EG methods as flexible and accurate tools for coupled flow and heat transport in complex geometries."

    "abstract": "We study the computation of lower and upper probabilities of hitting a target set of states for imprecise Markov chains. For these, transition uncertainty is modelled by a convex set of transition matrices. In the precise case, hitting probabilities are the minimal nonnegative solution of a linear system and admit a closed-form expression. We study the notion of reachability in the imprecise setting. The literature review highlights few different definitions of lower reachability; thus we explore the relations among them, presenting examples to clarify their logical implications. Using this revised definition of reachability for imprecise Markov chain, we partition the state space into classes of states whose hitting probabilities are trivially zero or one and those which require further computation. For these nontrivial states, we show that lower and upper hitting probabilities are the unique solutions of two nonlinear fixed-point equations. For the practical computation of lower and upper hitting probabilities, we propose iterative algorithms that alternate between solving a linear system and choosing an extreme point from the set of transition matrices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in practice, these algorithms converge in substantially fewer iterations than the theoretically established worst-case bound."

The protocol repurposes the mandatory 4-byte nLockTime field of every Bitcoin transaction as a compact metadata header. By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods."

We prove a relation between the twisted Selberg zeta function $Z(s;ρ)$ and the regularized determinant of the twisted Laplacian associated to $ρ$. These results can be viewed as a generalization of a result due to Sarnak who considered the trivial character. Yet our proof is different, as it is based on evaluation of the Laplace-Mellin type integral transformations. Going further, we explicitly compute the multiplicative constant, which we call the torsion factor, and express its dependence on parameters which determine the representation. We study the asymptotic behavior of the constant for a sequence of non-unitary representations introduced by Yamaguchi and prove that the asymptotic behavior of this constant as the dimension of the representation tends to infinity is the same as the behavior of the higher-dimensional Reidemeister torsion on $X_1$ (up to an absolute constant)."

To address these challenges, we present DataFlow, a unified and extensible LLM-driven data preparation framework. DataFlow is designed with system-level abstractions that enable modular, reusable, and composable data transformations, and provides a PyTorch-style pipeline construction API for building debuggable and optimizable dataflows. The framework consists of nearly 200 reusable operators and six domain-general pipelines spanning text, mathematical reasoning, code, Text-to-SQL, agentic RAG, and large-scale knowledge extraction. To further improve usability, we introduce DataFlow-Agent, which automatically translates natural-language specifications into executable pipelines via operator synthesis, pipeline planning, and iterative verification. Across six representative use cases, DataFlow consistently improves downstream LLM performance. Our math, code, and text pipelines outperform curated human datasets and specialized synthetic baselines, achieving up to +3\\% execution accuracy in Text-to-SQL over SynSQL, +7\\% average improvements on code benchmarks, and 1--3 point gains on MATH, GSM8K, and AIME. Moreover, a unified 10K-sample dataset produced by DataFlow enables base models to surpass counterparts trained on 1M Infinity-Instruct data.

At pump fluences below 3 mJ/cm$^2$, we observe a free carrier Drude spectrum and broad phonon resonances typical of a photoexcited semiconductor. With increasing fluence, a suppression of the DC photoconductivity is observed, indicating an interruption of long range transport due to phase disorder. Concomitantly, the c-axis polarized $B^2_{1u}$ optical phonon narrows and blueshifts, consistent with a transition to a higher symmetry structure. At intermediate fluences of 3.1 mJ/cm$^2$, a high frequency Lorentzian component appears that red shifts on a 50 ps time scale, where a Drude spectrum is eventually restored. Our results provide evidence for a non-thermal, photo-induced nucleation of higher symmetry, semi-metallic phase domains in SnSe appearing within 200 fs with the system relaxing back to its homogeneous $Pnma$ semiconducting phase on a 200 ps time scale."

We discuss the validity of the phenomenological friction term employed in hydrodynamical simulations. We find that for a Standard Model particle content, this approximation is (marginally) justified. We also test the hypothesis that the pressure from a runaway wall acts as an upper bound on the pressure from the local friction term. We find that next-to-leading order contributions in terms of velocity and mass are negative and that in the regime of validity, the local damping term indeed cannot surpass the pressure from runaway bubbles."

The chatbot prototype, developed with a Flask API backend and Flutter-based mobile frontend, achieves 87% semantic accuracy in functional testing across diverse topics including fiqh, aqidah, ibadah, and muamalah, demonstrating its potential to enhance religious literacy, digital da'wah, and access to verified Islamic knowledge in the Industry 4.0 era. While effective for closed-domain queries, limitations such as static learning and dataset dependency highlight opportunities for future enhancements like continuous adaptation and multi-turn conversation support, positioning this innovation as a bridge between traditional Islamic scholarship and modern AI-driven consultation."

    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency."

Here, we demonstrate a high two-photon interference visibility (a measure of the photon coherence) for both XX (V=94$\\pm$2%) and X (V=82$\\pm$6%) photons.

Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems."

In this work, we show that such optimizers can be provably improved by replacing their vanilla momentum by momentum variance reduction (MVR). Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks. In the non-convex case, we incorporate MVR into Gluon in three different ways. All of them improve the convergence rate from ${\\cal O} (\\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\\cal O} (\\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$.

On the experimental side, we highlight measurements of thermophysical properties of supercooled liquids via fast chip calorimetry and enhancements in mechanical properties through rejuvenation treatments. This work underscores the crucial role of short-range order and medium-range order in controlling metallic glass mechanical properties. Recent progress in structural probes allows in situ observations of deformation mechanisms, positioning the field well to further advance our understanding of mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing of metallic glasses is discussed as one encouraging new manufacturing route for metallic glasses. We examine laser powder-bed fusion process physics and the central trade-off between amorphicity and densification, including heat affected zone devitrification and defects formation, together with emerging mitigation strategies and applications. On the theoretical and simulation side, we review advances in nanoscale, mesoscale, and continuum modeling of metallic glasses that have led to promising approaches by which multiscale schemes can incorporate data sourced from atomic-scale simulations. These efforts have helped to elucidate the connection between the glass structure and mechanical and rheological responses. We also cover the development of machine learning interatomic potentials for metallic glasses, along with machine learning driven prediction of glass forming ability and inverse design methods.

    "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa."

Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection."

    "abstract": "In convex optimization, continuous-time counterparts have been a fruitful tool for analyzing momentum algorithms. Fewer such examples are available when the function to minimize is non-convex. In several cases, discrepancies arise between the existing discrete-time results, namely those obtained for momentum algorithms, and their continuous-time counterparts, with the latter typically yielding stronger guarantees. We argue that the continuized framework (Even et al., 2021), mixing continuous and discrete components, can tighten the gap between known continuous and discrete results. This framework relies on computations akin to standard Lyapunov analyses, from which are deduced convergence bounds for an algorithm that can be written as a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters. In this work, we extend the range of applicability of the continuized framework, e.g. by allowing it to handle non-smooth Lyapunov functions. We then strengthen its trajectory-wise guarantees for linear convergence rate, deriving finite time bounds with high probability and asymptotic almost sure bounds. We apply this framework to the non-convex class of strongly quasar convex functions. Adapting continuous-time results that have weaker discrete equivalents to the continuized method, we improve by a constant factor the known convergence rate, and relax the existing assumptions on the set of minimizers."

    "abstract": "Winds are an important ingredient in the evolution of X-ray binary (XRB) systems, particularly those at high accretion rates such as ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), because they may regulate the accretion of matter onto the compact object. We aim at understanding the properties of ULX winds and their link with the source spectral and temporal behavior. We performed high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the variable source NGC 55 ULX-1 to resolve emission and absorption lines as observed with XMM-Newton at different epochs. Optically-thin plasma models are used to characterise the wind. We confirmed and thoroughly strengthened previous evidence of outflows in NGC 55 ULX-1. The presence of radiative recombination signatures and the ratios between the fluxes of the emission lines favours photoionisation balance and low-to-moderate densities, which confirm that the lines originate from classical XRB disc winds. An in-depth parameter space exploration shows line emission from a slowly moving, cool, and variable plasma perhaps associated with a thermal wind. Mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts (about -0.15c) associated with the absorption lines confirm, at higher confidence, the presence of powerful, radiatively-driven, winds. The comparison between results obtained at different epochs revealed that the wind responds to the variability of the underlying continuum and these variations may be used to understand the actual accretion regime and the nature of the source."

    "abstract": "Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces."

    "abstract": "Generalizing causal knowledge across diverse environments is challenging, especially when estimates from large-scale datasets must be applied to smaller or systematically different contexts, where external validity is critical. Model-based estimators of individual treatment effects (ITE) from machine learning require large sample sizes, limiting their applicability in domains such as behavioral sciences with smaller datasets. We demonstrate how estimation of ITEs with Treatment Agnostic Representation Networks (TARNet; Shalit et al., 2017) can be improved by leveraging knowledge from source datasets and adapting it to new settings via transfer learning (TL-TARNet; Aloui et al., 2023). In simulations that vary source and sample sizes and consider both randomized and non-randomized intervention target settings, the transfer-learning extension TL-TARNet improves upon standard TARNet, reducing ITE error and attenuating bias when a large unbiased source is available and target samples are small. In an empirical application using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), we estimate the effect of mothers' firewood collection time on children's weekly study time; transfer learning pulls the target mean ITEs toward the source ITE estimate, reducing bias in the estimates obtained without transfer. These results suggest that transfer learning for causal models can improve the estimation of ITE in small samples."

    "abstract": "High-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are a potential core power-to-X (P2X) technology due to their unparalleled system efficiencies, that can exceed 85 % when excess heat from exothermic downstream processes is available. Recent advancements in materials, cell and stack design have enabled the deployment of megawatt (MW) scale demonstration plants and gigawatt (GW) scale manufacturing capacities. Consequently, key challenges to industrial-scale adoption scale now increasingly lie at the system level. Unlike previous SOEC reviews focused on materials and stack-level innovations, this work uniquely addresses emerging interdisciplinary system-level challenges and highlights the need for a paradigm shift. Several key insights are identified. Pressurized operation plays a crucial role in enhancing SOEC system performance and enabling better process integration. The dynamic capabilities of SOECs are better than often assumed and can further be improved via advanced operating strategies and modularization. Balance-of-plant (BoP) component costs rival stack capital expenditure, emphasizing the need for cost reductions through economies of scale via mass production and cross-industry synergies. Co-electrolysis remains at a lower technology readiness level and lacks MW scale demonstration. Furthermore, demonstrated integration with downstream processes across entire P2X chains remains scarce. Future research and development strategies are proposed, offering a roadmap to overcome these challenges and accelerate SOEC commercialization."

    "abstract": "Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation."

Recently we have employed this formalism to compute the free energy of flux tubes (essentially a two-dimensional theory of derivatively coupled scalars) and the two-loop $O(α_s)$ QCD thermal free energy. Moving to higher orders, it is well known that at $O(α_s^2)$ in QCD, or e.g. at $O(λ^2)$ in $λφ^4$ theory, the free energy develops IR divergences. These IR divergences are resolved by the screening Debye mass. However, the DMB formalism expresses the free energy in terms of a trace of the S-matrix operator in the vacuum. How, then, does the Debye mass arise in this framework? In this work we address this question, thereby paving the way for higher-order applications of the DMB formalism in relativistic QFT."

The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified."

Using the $ρ$, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $f_0$ unflavored mesons and their excitations as training data, the model learns confining effective potentials and computes a dilaton profile that satisfies the null energy condition. The network predicts the IR behavior of dilaton to be in-between linear and quadratic forms. Moreover, the symmetry-breaking bulk potential of the scalar field, $V(X)= k_1 X^3+k_2 X^4$, was computed, and the parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ predicted to be $\\sim - \\ 8$ and $\\sim 17$ respectively.

Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region."

To compare our proposed architecture with a variety of causal open-source models, we created a new evaluation set comprising long, low-SNR recordings in 12 languages across everyday noise scenarios, better reflecting real-world conditions than commonly used benchmarks. On this evaluation set, DPDFNet delivers superior performance to other causal open-source models, including some that are substantially larger and more computationally demanding.

We further demonstrate on-device feasibility by deploying DPDFNet on Ceva-NeuPro-Nano edge NPUs. Results indicate that DPDFNet-4, our second-largest model, achieves real-time performance on NPN32 and runs even faster on NPN64, confirming that state-of-the-art quality can be sustained within strict embedded power and latency constraints."

Outside of these obvious points, this paper asks how AI can negatively affect cybersecurity and law when used for the design and deployment of security infrastructure by its developers. Firstly, the paper discusses the use of LLMs in security, either directly or indirectly, and briefly tackles other types of AI. It then lists norms in cybersecurity, then a range of legal cybersecurity obligations from the European Union, to create a frame of reference. Secondly, the paper describes how LLMs may fail to fulfil both legal obligations and best practice in cybersecurity is given, and the paper ends with some economic and practical consequences for this development, with some notions of solutions as well. The paper finds that using LLMs comes with many risks, many of which are against good security practice, and the legal obligations in security regulation. This is because of the inherent weaknesses of LLMs, most of which are mitigated if replaced with symbolic AI. Both also have issues fulfilling basic traceability obligations and practice. Solutions are secondary systems surrounding LLM based AI, fulfilment of security norms beyond legal requirements and simply not using such technology in certain situations."

For the latter, we introduce a new approach to obtain Berry-Esseen inequalities for nonlinear functions of sum statistics under some convexity assumptions. Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies.

Building on this formulation, we introduce the Geometric Laplace Neural Operator (GLNO), which embeds the Laplace spectral representation into the eigen-basis of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, extending operator learning to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds without requiring periodicity or uniform grids. We further design a grid-invariant network architecture (GLNONet) that realizes GLNO in practice. Extensive experiments on PDEs/ODEs and real-world datasets demonstrate our robust performance over other state-of-the-art models."

    "abstract": "Associative polymers are a class of polymers containing attractive stickers that can reversibly bind to each other. Their fully-bonded state gives rise, in dilute conditions, to a fluid phase of so-called single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). These constructs have been used in a wide range of applications, from the design of new materials (e.g. biomolecular condensates) to drug-delivery vectors. The thermodynamic properties of SCNPs sensitively depend on the number of different sticker types, since numerical simulations show that a continuous transition to a network of chains upon increase of polymer concentration in the single sticker-type case can be replaced by an abrupt network formation (via a first-order phase transition) in the multiple sticker-type case. We present here a theory that, using the SCNP fluid as the reference system, quantifies the free energy change associated with transferring an intra-molecular bond to an inter-molecular bond, elucidating the impact on the phase separation process of the sticker topology. Despite its simplicity, the theory highlights which microscopic assumptions (looping statistics, chain-level excluded volume) are most relevant for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of these systems. Our results match available numerical predictions obtained via coarse grained simulations of these systems, highlighting in particular the sensitivity of the phase behaviour on the sequence of the stickers along the chain."

As a workaround, a second-order Taylor expansion is applied to the nonlinear field equations, under the assumption that the extra degree of freedom n, which quantifies deviations from the currently favored cosmological model (ΛCDM), remains sufficiently small to preserve the key properties of the ΛCDM model. The validity of the Taylor expansion is supported by supernova data indicating n \\leq 0.05, for which the power spectrum can be accurately computed within CLASS with a negligible truncation error."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms."

    "abstract": "The Marangoni instability of cylindrical drops in vertical Hele-Shaw cells immersed in stably stratified liquids has been studied previously, yet the underlying mechanism has not been explored thoroughly. Here we study the onset of the Marangoni instability of such a system by experimentally explore the parameter space of the drop radius and concentration gradient. The concentration field is directly observed with laser interferometry. The flow is found to become unstable when advection is too strong for diffusion to maintain a stable concentration field. However, two different instability regimes are found depending on the drop radius. When the drop is small, the friction force caused by the two plates of the Hele-Shaw cell is small so that it does not change much the velocity field. Marangoni advection in such a regime can be very strong so that the entire periphery of the drop can become unstable. When the drop is large, the friction becomes so large that the Marangoni velocity plateaus and the boundary layer thickness is also reduced. The modified velocity and concentration fields lead to another instability regime, where only liquid close to the equator of the drop becomes unstable. A unifying scaling theory that includes both instability regimes is developed, which agrees well with the experimental results. Our findings may shed new light on the understandings of Marangoni flows in confined geometries."

    "abstract": "In recent years, counterparts of phenomena studied in spintronics have been actively explored in the orbital sector. The relationship between orbital degrees of freedom and crystal chirality has also been intensively investigated, although the distinction from gyrotropic properties has not been fully clarified. In this work, we investigate spin and orbital Edelstein effects as well as the nonlinear responses in the ternary transition-metal chalcogenide Cu$_2$WSe$_4$, which has a gyrotropic but achiral crystal structure. We find that in the Edelstein effect, magnetization is dominated by the orbital contribution rather than the spin contribution. On the other hand, both the nonlinear chiral thermoelectric (NCTE) Hall effect--a response to the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient--and the nonlinear Hall effect--conventional second-order response to the electric field--are found to be dominated by the Berry curvature dipole. We further find that spin-orbit coupling plays only a minor role in these effects, whereas the orbital degrees of freedom are essential. Finally, we demonstrate that the orbital magnetic-moment contributions to both the Edelstein effect and the NCTE Hall effect are closely linked to chirality, and we discuss the possibility of using them as a chirality indicator."

    "abstract": "Quantum tunnelling, a hallmark phenomenon of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through the classically forbidden region. It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero \"stationary speed,\" as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena."

This is motivated by recent realizations of bubble traps in microgravity conditions, which open the possibility of investigating quantum many-body physics beyond the conventional flat-space paradigm. The theoretical interest up to now was mainly focused on Bose gases and their phenomenology, and had left the study of Fermi gases behind. In this paper, we investigate a two-component repulsive Fermi gas constrained to the surface of a sphere at finite temperature. We first analyze the non-interacting case, showing how the intrinsic geometrical features of the spherical surface give rise to a shell structures and modify the low-temperature thermodynamics compared to the flat two-dimensional gas. Repulsive interactions are then considered through an effective path-integral approach within a Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, enabling us to derive the grand canonical potential and to regularize the associated Matsubara summation. We then investigate the stability of the spin-balanced state and obtain the finite-temperature Stoner criterion for fermions on a sphere, highlighting the interplay between the repulsive interactions and shell effects."

Structural and magnetic characterization reveals high-quality single-crystal growth, with compensation temperature close to the reported bulk value (~80 K). Magnetic phase diagrams based on element-specific measurements map out the regions where ferrimagnetic, canted, and aligned phases are stable across the compensation temperature. The micromagnetic dynamics resulting from perpendicular magnetic pulse perturbation of an in-plane magnetized layer was investigated at room temperature and reveals complex configurations.

In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis"

It can successfully predict phase separation phenomena in blends of incompatible materials. However, it is limited to amorphous mixtures, excluding systems where the phase segregation is shaped by the concurrent crystallization of one or several blend components. A generalization of the Flory-Huggins formalism is thus necessary to capture the coupling and the interplay of crystallization with amorphous demixing mechanisms, such as spinodal decomposition. This work therefore revolves around the derivation of a free energy model for multicomponent mixtures that encompasses the physics of both processes. It is detailed which concepts from the original Flory-Huggins theory are required to apprehend the presented developments and how the current framework is built upon them. Furthermore, additional discussion points address chemical potential calculations and selected examples of binary and ternary phase diagrams, thereby highlighting the variety of blend behaviors that can be represented."

    "abstract": "Accelerated charged particles offer significant physical advantages over X-rays in radiotherapy. In addition to their superior depth-dose distribution, heavy ions provide notable biological benefits compared to protons. Specifically, at therapeutic energies, very heavy ions are expected to exhibit high relative biological effectiveness and a low oxygen enhancement ratio, making them potentially ideal for treating radioresistant tumors. Over fifty years ago, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory started a clinical trial to treat cancer patients with particles ranging from helium to argon. However, treatments with ions of atomic number greater than 10 proved highly toxic to normal tissue. Most patients were ultimately treated with helium ions, whose biological effects closely resemble those of protons. In recent years, novel strategies have emerged that can reduce normal tissue toxicity in radiotherapy while preserving tumor control. These advancements open the possibility of revisiting the clinical use of heavier ions. In this paper, we propose that neon ions may serve as an effective modality for treating resistant, hypoxic tumors. Their associated toxicity may be mitigated by employing approaches such as ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) or spatially fractionated radiotherapy. Current plans and prospects for the clinical application of neon ions will be discussed."

Thus, we empirically demonstrated the improvement proposed by our approach in mitigating goal-hijacking vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our work recognizes the increasing relevance of small open-sourced LLMs and their potential for broad deployments on edge devices, aligning with future trends in LLM applications. We contribute to the greater ecosystem of open-source LLMs and their security in the following: (1) assessing present prompt-based defenses against the latest attacks, (2) introducing a new framework using a seed defense (Chain Of Thoughts) to refine the defense prompts iteratively, and (3) showing significant improvements in detecting goal hijacking attacks.

Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance."

    "abstract": "Understanding the quenching of star formation in central galaxies remains a core challenge in galaxy evolution. Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M_{h}\\sim 10^{12.1}M_\\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold."

We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability.

In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-δ}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties."

Assuming that the curvature part of the $f(R,φ)$ behaves as Starobinsky gravity, we assess post-inflation dynamical stability of the theory in Einstein frame and proceed to isolate two distinct fixed points that provide a stable late-time accelerating universe. Comparison with DESI, Cosmic Chronometers, and SNeIa datasets adds more stringent constraints to the behavior of the theory near the present epoch, giving us one stable fixed point where expansion is driven by a phantom scalar field.

By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics."

    "abstract": "Self-testing is a correlation-based framework that enables the certification of both the underlying quantum state and the implemented measurements without imposing any assumptions on the internal structure of the devices. In this work, we introduce a self-testing protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state based on a natural generalization of Hardy's nonlocality argument. Within this framework, we prove that the correlation achieving the maximal Hardy success probability constitutes an extremal point of the quantum correlation set and, moreover, that this point is \\emph{exposed}. To address experimentally relevant imperfections, we further develop a robust self-testing analysis tailored to the Hardy construction. Additionally, we show that, in this scenario, the quantum correlation that attains the maximal violation of the Hardy-type paradox coincides with the correlation that yields the maximal violation of the Mermin inequality. This establishes a unified perspective in which the same multipartite correlation admits both a logical-paradox interpretation and a Bell-inequality-based characterization. Collectively, our results pave the way for investigating whether the correlations that maximally violate the generalized $N$-party Hardy paradox remain exposed in higher-party regimes."

    "abstract": "3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Parametric amplification offers a powerful means to enhance quantum interactions through field squeezing, yet it typically introduces additional noise which accelerates quantum decoherence, a major obstacle for scalable quantum information processing. The squeezing field is implemented in cavities rather than continuous waveguides, thereby limiting its scalability for applications in quantum simulation. Giant atoms, which couple to waveguides at multiple points, provide a promising route to mitigate dissipation via engineered interference, enabling decoherence-free interactions. We extend the squeezing-amplified interaction to a novel quantum platform combining giant atoms with traveling-wave parametric waveguides based on $χ^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. By exploiting destructive interference between different coupling points, the interaction between giant atoms is not only significantly enhanced but also becomes immune to squeezed noise. Unlike conventional waveguide quantum electrodynamics without a squeezing pump, the giant emitters exhibit both exchange and pairing interactions, making this platform particularly suitable for simulating many-body quantum physics. More intriguingly, the strengths of these interactions can be smoothly tuned by adjusting the squeezing and coupling parameters. Our architecture thus provides a versatile and scalable platform for quantum simulation of strongly correlated physics and paves the way toward robust quantum control in many-body regimes."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "The common envelope (CE) interaction between an expanding giant star and a compact companion typically leads to a rapid orbital decay, ending in either a merger or the formation of a close binary. However, the existence of post-red giant and post-asymptotic giant branch binaries with separations of 100 to 800 Rsun challenges this standard picture, as these systems appear to have experienced strong interactions without undergoing a classic CE inspiral. In this work, we investigate the effect of high mass ratio, q = M2/M1, on the CE inspiral using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM. The primary is a 0.88 Msun, 90 Rsun red giant branch star, while the companion masses span q = 0.68 to 1.5. Higher mass ratios lead to wider post-CE separations, with a maximum of approximately 40 Rsun. The pre-CE mass transfer phase is longer for larger companion masses, and for q greater than or equal to 1 the inspiral becomes significantly more stable, broadly consistent with analytical expectations. This phase is not fully converged with respect to numerical resolution, and higher resolution simulations are expected to further increase its duration and stability. Although higher q systems show enhanced mass loss through the L2 and L3 Lagrange points, we find that circumbinary discs are more likely to form from fallback of bound envelope material. Fallback times are short, of order a few hundred years, and fallback radii lie well outside the binary, between 0.5 and 5 au, where discs are expected to spread efficiently through viscous torques. While high mass ratio systems produce wider post-interaction separations, these remain smaller than those observed. In contrast, fallback-formed discs have properties consistent with observed circumbinary discs."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations."

Short-range interactions within the two-body subsystems included microscopic np, nd, n4He, and n3He scattering matrices, as well as phenomenological d3He models that allow for the coupling of the elastic channel with the d3He reaction channel. The roles of the d3He models and the Coulomb interaction between the 3He and T nuclei are briefly discussed. The resulting three-body reaction matrix was then utilized to estimate the role of a muon in the process 3He+(Ty-)\\to n+p+4He+y- involving a Ty- atom, where y- in [e-,mu-]. It is demonstrated that the effect of cross-section enhancement induced by the muon's presence in the reaction zone is governed by a phase factor and persists in the first Born approximation for the exact four-body scattering matrix."

For the first time, we develop a data-driven model of the Martian induced magnetospheric magnetic field using Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) combined with MAVEN observations and physical laws. Trained under varying solar wind conditions, including B_IMF, P_SW, and θ_cone, the data-driven model accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional magnetic field configuration and its variability in response to upstream solar wind drivers. Based on the PINN results, we identify key dependencies of magnetic field configuration on solar wind parameters, including the hemispheric asymmetries of the draped field line strength in the Mars-Solar-Electric coordinates. These findings demonstrate the capability of PINNs to reconstruct complex magnetic field structures in the Martian induced magnetosphere, thereby offering a promising tool for advancing studies of solar wind-Mars interactions."

By considering noncommutative entry functions on matrix structures, Woronowicz introduced corepresentations of compact quantum groups, namely Woronowicz's $C^*$-algebras (also known as compact matrix pseudogroups). We demonstrate that every nontrivial finite sequence of random variables admits a maximal distributional symmetry determined by a Woronowicz $C^*$-algebra. This establishes a probabilistic framework for classifying compact quantum groups. Furthermore, we classify all de Finetti-type theorems for *-random variables that are invariant under distributional symmetries arising from compact matrix quantum groups in both classical and free probability settings. Our results show that only finitely many types of de Finetti theorems exist in these contexts, and the associated categories of (quantum) groups are the easy (quantum) groups introduced by Banica and Speicher."

On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenböck torsion plays a crucial rôle. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories."

A Galactic census of pulsars will, in addition, will yield the discovery of dozens of relativistic pulsar systems, including potentially pulsar -- black hole binaries, which can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the ``no-hair'' theorem. Aspects of gravitation to be explored include tests of strong equivalence principles, gravitational dipole radiation, extra field components of gravitation, gravitomagnetism, and spacetime symmetries.

Thus far, 345 radio pulsars have been found in globular clusters. These can be used as precision probes of the structure, gas content, magnetic field, and dynamic history of their host clusters; some of them are also highly interesting in their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios as well as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity; one of them (PSR~J0514$-$4002E) might even be the first pulsar - black hole system known. Deep searches with SKA-MID and SKA-LOW will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be done during early commissioning of the telescope, before an all-sky pulsar survey using hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. Even a conservative approach predicts new discoveries only with the core of SKA-MID AA*, and the full AA* and eventually AA4 is expected to increase the number of discoveries even more, leading to more than doubling the current known population. This offers a great opportunity for early SKAO pulsar science, even before all the collecting area is in place. On the other hand, a more optimistic prediction calls for a 4-5 times growth of the population, leading to a total of about 1700 pulsars to be detectable with SKA-MID AA4 configuration in all Galactic GCs visible by SKA telescopes. Thus, a dedicated search for pulsars in globular clusters will fully exploit the best possible natural laboratories to study many branches of physics and astrophysics, including properties of dense matter, stellar evolution, and the dynamical history of the Galactic globular cluster systems."

Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method."

The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %.

In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks.

    "abstract": "The Bank of Korea (BoK) regularly publishes the Economic Outlook, offering forecasts for key macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment rates. This study examines whether the BoK's inflation forecasts exhibit bias, specifically a tendency to align with its inflation target. We extend the Holden and Peel (1990) test to incorporate state-dependency, defining the state of the economy based on whether realized inflation falls below the target at the time of the forecast. Our analysis reveals that the BoK's inflation forecasts are biased under this state-dependent framework. Furthermore, we examine a range of bias correction strategies based on AR(1) and mean error models, including their state-dependent variants. These strategies generally improve forecast accuracy. Among them, the AR(1)-based correction exhibits relatively stable performance, consistently reducing the root mean square error."

We introduce an invariant-flow formulation for extracting fundamental frequencies of integrable Hamiltonian systems. By treating invariants as generators of commuting Hamiltonian flows, the frequencies are obtained from time-of-flight parameters along these flows, providing a direct alternative to action-angle constructions and spectral methods based on long time series. The approach yields an explicit numerical procedure that extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using the McMillan map, where machine-precision accuracy is achieved."

Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x."

What am I looking at?, etc.). These devices will sense an egocentric view of the world around us to observe all human- relevant signals across space and time to construct and maintain a user's personal context. This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications. However, designing a wearable system to support contextual AI is a daunting task because of the system's complexity and stringent power constraints due to weight and battery restrictions. To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems."

Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems."

Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance."

    "abstract": "A non-uniform channel input distribution is key for achieving the capacity of arbitrary channels. However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution. In these simulations, we found that generalized ESS improves the maximum transmission rate by 0.0425 bit/symbol at a frame error rate below 10^{-4} compared to CCDM."

    "abstract": "Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific \"stabilizer-testing\" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\\mathrm{cl}}^* \\leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality."

Exciting trapped ions to high-lying electronic Rydberg states provides a promising route to overcome these limitations by enabling strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions that support much faster multi-qubit operations. Here, we introduce the first scheme for implementing a native controlled-controlled-Z gate with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions by optimizing a single-pulse protocol that accounts for the finite Rydberg-state lifetime. The resulting gate outperforms standard decompositions into one- and two-qubit gates by achieving fidelities above 97% under realistic conditions, with execution times of about 2 microseconds at cryogenic temperatures. To explore the potential of trapped Rydberg ions for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, and to illustrate the utility of three-qubit Rydberg-ion gates in this context, we develop and analyze a proposal for fault-tolerant, measurement-free quantum error correction using the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code. Our simulations confirm that quantum error correction can be performed in a fully fault-tolerant manner on a linear Rydberg-ion chain despite its limited qubit connectivity. These results establish native multiqubit Rydberg-ion gates as a valuable resource for fast, high-fidelity quantum computing and highlight their potential for fault-tolerant quantum error correction."

    "abstract": "Subset sampling (also known as Poisson sampling), where the decision to include any specific element in the sample is made independently of all others, is a fundamental primitive in data analytics, enabling efficient approximation by processing representative subsets rather than massive datasets. While sampling from explicit lists is well-understood, modern applications -- such as machine learning over relational data -- often require sampling from a set defined implicitly by a relational join. In this paper, we study the problem of \\emph{subset sampling over joins}: drawing a random subset from the join results, where each join result is included independently with some probability. We address the general setting where the probability is derived from input tuple weights via decomposable functions (e.g., product, sum, min, max). Since the join size can be exponentially larger than the input, the naive approach of materializing all join results to perform subset sampling is computationally infeasible. We propose the first efficient algorithms for subset sampling over acyclic joins: (1) a \\emph{static index} for generating multiple (independent) subset samples over joins; (2) a \\emph{one-shot} algorithm for generating a single subset sample over joins; (3) a \\emph{dynamic index} that can support tuple insertions, while maintaining a one-shot sample or generating multiple (independent) samples. Our techniques achieve near-optimal time and space complexity with respect to the input size and the expected sample size."

However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability."

The regularity of the solution to the Hamiltonian system is obtained, including the derivatives with respect to the initial state and the Malliavin derivatives. The connection between the Hamiltonian system and the value function is subsequently proven, enabling us to derive regularity properties of the value function via probabilistic techniques. Finally, by the dynamic programming principle, the value function is verified to be the unique classical solution to the HJB equation and the optimal feedback control is provided.

Because the scams are inherently text-based, they raise urgent questions about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both current and future automation. We investigate this intersection by interviewing 145 insiders and 5 scam victims, performing a blinded long-term conversation study comparing LLM scam agents to human operators, and executing an evaluation of commercial safety filters. Our findings show that LLMs are already widely deployed within scam organizations, with 87% of scam labor consisting of systematized conversational tasks readily susceptible to automation. In a week-long study, an LLM agent not only elicited greater trust from study participants (p=0.007) but also achieved higher compliance with requests than human operators (46% vs. 18% for humans). Meanwhile, popular safety filters detected 0.0% of romance baiting dialogues.

However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as judges (LaaJ) in code generation pipelines. While attractive for scalability, LaaJs tend to overlook domain specific issues raising concerns about their reliability in critical evaluation tasks. To better understand these limitations in practice, we examine LaaJ behavior in a concrete industrial use case: legacy code modernization via COBOL code generation. In this setting, we find that even production deployed LaaJs can miss domain critical errors, revealing consistent blind spots in their evaluation capabilities. To better understand these blind spots, we analyze generated COBOL programs and associated LaaJs judgments, drawing on expert knowledge to construct a preliminary taxonomy. Based on this taxonomy, we develop a lightweight analytic checker tool that flags over 30 domain specific issues observed in practice. We use its outputs as analytic hints, dynamically injecting them into the judges prompt to encourage LaaJ to revisit aspects it may have overlooked. Experiments on a test set of 100 programs using four production level LaaJs show that LaaJ alone detects only about 45% of the errors present in the code (in all judges we tested), while the analytic checker alone lacks explanatory depth. When combined, the LaaJ+Hints configuration achieves up to 94% coverage (for the best performing judge and injection prompt) and produces qualitatively richer, more accurate explanations, demonstrating that analytic-LLM hybrids can substantially enhance evaluation reliability in deployed pipelines. We release the dataset and all used prompts."

A transition between disordered and ordered states occurs on spheres as well as on oblate and prolate spheroids. As the deviation from sphericity increases, the transition point shifts to higher alignment strengths, and swarming localizes to an equatorial belt away from the poles, indicating that curvature heterogeneity influences the emergence of the polar-ordered state."

However, the hard reset mechanism employed in spiking neurons leads to information degradation due to its uniform handling of diverse membrane potentials. Furthermore, the utilization of overly simplified neuron models that disregard the intricate biological structures inherently impedes the network's capacity to accurately simulate the actual potential transmission process. To address these issues, we propose a dendrite-soma-axon (DSA) neuron employing the soft reset strategy, in conjunction with a potential change-based perception mechanism, culminating in the change-perceptive dendrite-soma-axon (CP-DSA) neuron. Our model contains multiple learnable parameters that expand the representation space of neurons. The change-perceptive (CP) mechanism enables our model to achieve competitive performance in short time steps utilizing the difference information of adjacent time steps. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the CP-DSA model and the functional characteristics of its internal parameters. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on various datasets substantiate the significant advantages of the CP-DSA model over state-of-the-art approaches."

Yet in Latin America, there is no consolidated, region wide integration of quantum computing into secondary education, and the feasibility conditions for doing so remain largely unexamined. This paper proposes a qualitative, comparative framework to assess academic readiness for quantum education across six countries - Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia - grounded in the relationship between curriculum compatibility and enabling conditions spanning institutional capacity, teacher preparation, infrastructure, and equity. Using official curricula, policy documents, national statistics, and educational reports, we apply structured qualitative coding and a 1-5 ordinal scoring system to generate a cross country diagnosis. The findings reveal substantial regional asymmetries: among the six countries studied, Chile emerges as the most institutionally prepared for progressive quantum education integration, while the remaining countries exhibit varying combinations of curricular gaps and fragmented but promising enabling conditions. Building on this diagnosis, we propose a country sensitive, regionally coordinated roadmap for staged implementation, beginning with teacher development and pilot centers, leveraging open source platforms and local language resources, and scaling toward gradual curricular integration. This work establishes a baseline for future quantitative and mixed method studies evaluating learning outcomes, motivation, and scalable models for quantum education in Latin America."

These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities."

Recognizing the computational cost of advancing neural rerankers, we analyze techniques for enhancing efficiency, notably knowledge distillation for creating competitive, lighter alternatives. Furthermore, we map the emerging territory of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking, examining novel prompting strategies and fine-tuning tactics. This survey seeks to elucidate the fundamental ideas, relative effectiveness, computational features, and real-world trade-offs of various reranking strategies.

This research addresses the critical question: How can AI-powered systems integrate family history data with clinical imaging to enhance dermatological diagnosis while supporting clinical trial validation and real-world implementation? We developed a comprehensive multi-modal AI framework that combines deep learning-based image analysis with structured clinical data, including detailed family history patterns. Our approach employs interpretable convolutional neural networks integrated with clinical decision trees that incorporate hereditary risk factors. The methodology includes prospective clinical trials across diverse healthcare settings to validate AI-assisted diagnosis against traditional clinical assessment. In this work, validation was conducted with healthcare professionals to assess AI-assisted outputs against clinical expectations; prospective clinical trials across diverse healthcare settings are proposed as future work. The integrated AI system demonstrates enhanced diagnostic accuracy when family history data is incorporated, particularly for hereditary skin conditions such as melanoma, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Expert feedback indicates potential for improved early detection and more personalized recommendations; formal clinical trials are planned. The framework is designed for integration into clinical workflows while maintaining interpretability through explainable AI mechanisms."

To design frequentist studies that leverage robust analysis methods, suitable sample sizes to achieve desired power are often found by estimating sampling distributions of p-values via intensive simulation. Moreover, most sample size recommendations rely heavily on assumptions about a single data-generating process. Consequently, robustness in data analysis does not by itself imply robustness in study design, as examining sample size sensitivity to data-generating assumptions typically requires further simulations. We propose an economical alternative for determining sample sizes that are robust to multiple data-generating mechanisms. Applying our theoretical results that model p-values as a function of the sample size, we assess power across the sample size space using simulations conducted at only two sample sizes for each data-generating mechanism. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our methodology to study design based on M-estimators in both experimental and observational settings through a varied set of clinical examples."

Then, we introduce Lookahead PArallel Decoding LoPA, a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm, to identify a superior TFO and hence accelerate inference. LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence. We apply LoPA to the state-of-the-art D2F model and observe a substantial enhancement in decoding efficiency. Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline. Furthermore, to facilitate this unprecedented degree of parallelism, we develop a specialized multi-device inference system featuring Branch Parallelism (BP), which achieves a single-sample throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second under multi-GPU deployment.

    "abstract": "Lifeline infrastructure underpins the continuity of daily life, yet conventional criticality assessments remain largely asset-centric, inferring importance from physical capacity or network topology rather than actual behavioral reliance. This disconnect frequently obscures the true societal cost of disruption, particularly in underserved communities where residents lack service alternatives. This study bridges the gap between engineering risk analysis and human mobility analysis by introducing functional criticality, a human-centered metric that quantifies the behavioral indispensability of specific facilities based on large-scale visitation patterns. Leveraging 1.02 million anonymized mobility records for Harris County, Texas, we operationalize lifeline criticality as a function of visitation intensity, catchment breadth, and origin-specific substitutability. Results reveal that dependence is highly concentrated: a small subset of super-critical facilities (2.8% of grocery stores and 14.8% of hospitals) supports a disproportionate share of routine access. By coupling these behavioral scores with probabilistic flood hazard models for 2020 and 2060, we demonstrate a pronounced risk-multiplier effect. While physical flood depths increase only moderately under future climate scenarios, the population-weighted vulnerability of access networks surges by 67.6%. This sharp divergence establishes that future hazards will disproportionately intersect with the specific nodes communities rely on most. The proposed framework advances resilience assessment by embedding human behavior directly into the definition of infrastructure importance, providing a scalable foundation for equitable, adaptive, and human-centered resilience planning."

To address these issues, we introduce NGCAPTCHA, a Next Generation CAPTCHA framework that integrates a lightweight client side proof of work (PoW) mechanism with an AI resistant visual recognition challenge. In NGCAPTCHA, a browser must first complete a small hash based PoW before any challenge is displayed, throttling large scale automated attempts by increasing their computational cost. Once the PoW is solved, the user is presented with a human friendly yet model resistant image selection task that exploits perceptual cues current vision systems still struggle with.

Rapid mass flows, including landslides and avalanches, cause several thousand deaths across a wide range of environments, often travelling many kilometres from their source. The wide range of source conditions and material properties governing these flows makes their runout difficult to anticipate, particularly for downstream communities that may be suddenly exposed to severe impacts. Accurately predicting runout at scale requires models that are both physically realistic and computationally efficient, yet existing approaches face a fundamental speed-realism trade-off. Here we train a machine learning model to predict geohazard runout across representative real world terrains. The model predicts both flow extent and deposit thickness with high accuracy and 100 to 10,000 times faster computation than numerical solvers. It is trained on over 100,000 numerical simulations across over 10,000 real world digital elevation model chips and reproduces key physical behaviours, including avulsion and deposition patterns, while generalizing across different flow types, sizes and landscapes. Our results demonstrate that neural emulation enables rapid, spatially resolved runout prediction across diverse real world terrains, opening new opportunities for disaster risk reduction and impact-based forecasting. These results highlight neural emulation as a promising pathway for extending physically realistic geohazard modelling to spatial and temporal scales relevant for large scale early warning systems."

Our goal is to develop robust numerical methods capable of uncovering diverse stationary solutions in such NLS models. Specifically, and in line with recent theoretical and experimental interest, we focus on ultracold quantum droplets in Bose mixtures influenced by the Lee Huang Yang quantum fluctuation correction and study these systems in one and two dimensional settings. To this end, we deploy several numerical techniques. The homotopy grid method allows systematic refinement from coarse to fine spatial discretizations in one dimension, while the dimension by dimension homotopy approach extends one-dimensional solutions to two-dimensional domains. These methods effectively detect broad families of stationary states, many of which have not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, they enable the monitoring of solution continuation and bifurcation phenomena. During our investigation, we encounter unusual bifurcation events, including nonstandard pitchforks and saddle-center bifurcations, which exhibit novel stability transitions. For example, we identify continuous pathways connecting vortex and dark soliton stripe branches, absent in the standard cubic defocusing model. Overall, the presence of competing mean-field and quantum fluctuation interactions leads to a richer bifurcation structure than in traditional cubic NLS systems. These findings suggest that similar complex bifurcation and stability phenomena may appear in other settings, including higher-dimensional systems or models with competing nonlinearities such as cubic-quintic interactions, highlighting the importance of further theoretical and numerical exploration."

Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise.

In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks.

This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \\emph{explicit}, and \\emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities.

    "abstract": "We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data."

    "abstract": "Color centers hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for single-photon emission and coherent spin-photon interfaces that underpin quantum communication and quantum networking technologies. As a wide-bandgap van der Waals material, hBN can host individual optically active quantum defects emitting across the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, but existing color centers often show broad phonon sidebands (PSBs), unstable emission, or inconvenient wavelengths. Here, we show a simple, scalable oxygen-plasma process that reproducibly creates oxygen-related single quantum emitters in hBN with blinking-free zero-phonon lines spanning the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum from 700-960 nanometers. These emitters demonstrate room-temperature operation, high brightness, and ultra-sharp cryogenic linewidths in the few-gigahertz range under non-resonant excitation. Analysis of the PSBs shows weak electron-phonon coupling and predominant zero-phonon-line emission, while first-principles calculations identify plausible oxygen-related defect configurations. These emitters provide a promising platform for indistinguishable NIR single photons towards free-space quantum networking."

This study investigates the origins of binding energy shifts and satellite peaks formation observed during plasma XPS measurements across conductive, dielectric, and gas phase systems. Using a standard laboratory based ambient pressure XPS apparatus coupled with an alternating current driven capacitively coupled plasma source, we show that metastable surface species, such as transient Au oxides, can be detected during plasma exposure, revealing chemical states hardly accessible using conventional ultrahigh vacuum XPS. In dielectric samples, we observe pressure- and plasma type dependent BE shifts up to 50 eV, attributed to X ray induced and plasma mediated surface charging. These shifts are mitigated at higher pressures plasmas or in electronegative plasmas, the latter due to enhanced charge compensation mechanisms involving slow negative ions. For gas phase species, AC plasma excitation leads to spectral broadening and the emergence of satellite peaks with a few eV energy separations, linked to oscillating local plasma potentials in the probing volume. These findings highlight the important and complex interplay of plasma parameters, surface charging, and local electric fields in shaping XPS spectra. Overall, plasma XPS emerges as a critical metrological tool for probing transient surface chemistry, with implications for semiconductor processing, material synthesis, and plasma diagnostics."

Accordingly, stMFG is proposed, a multi-scale interactive fusion graph network that introduces layer-wise cross-view attention to dynamically integrate spatial and gene features after each convolution. The model combines cross-view contrastive learning with spatial constraints to enhance discriminability while maintaining spatial continuity. On DLPFC and breast cancer datasets, stMFG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 14% ARI improvement on certain slices."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of cloud-based services, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly accessible through various web platforms. However, this accessibility has also led to growing risks of model abuse. LLM watermarking has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate such misuse and protect intellectual property. Existing watermarking algorithms, however, primarily focus on defending against paraphrase attacks while overlooking piggyback spoofing attacks, which can inject harmful content, compromise watermark reliability, and undermine trust in attribution. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard, the first watermarking algorithm capable of defending against both paraphrase and spoofing attacks. DualGuard employs the adaptive dual-stream watermarking mechanism, in which two complementary watermark signals are dynamically injected based on the semantic content. This design enables DualGuard not only to detect but also to trace spoofing attacks, thereby ensuring reliable and trustworthy watermark detection. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets and language models demonstrate that DualGuard achieves excellent detectability, robustness, traceability, and text quality, effectively advancing the state of LLM watermarking for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Stochastic quantization - introduced by Nelson in 1966 - describes quantum behavior as a conservative diffusion process in which a particle undergoes Brownian-like motion with a fluctuation amplitude set by Planck's constant. While it fully reproduces conventional quantum mechanics, this approach provides an alternative framework that enables the study of dynamical quantities not easily defined within the standard formulation. In the present work, stochastic quantization is employed to investigate tunneling-time statistics for bound states in double-well potentials. Using first-passage time theory within the stochastic quantization framework, both the mean tunneling time, $\\barτ$, and the full probability distribution, $p(τ)$, are computed, and the theoretical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations of stochastic trajectories for the two potentials considered as representative cases. For the square double-well potential, analytical expressions for $\\barτ$ are derived and show excellent agreement with simulations. In the high-barrier limit, the results reveal a direct relation between the stochastic-mechanical and quantum-mechanical tunneling times, expressed as $τ_{\\mathrm{QM}} = (π/2)\\barτ$, where $τ_{\\mathrm{QM}}$ corresponds to half the oscillation period of the probability of finding the particle in either well. This relation is further confirmed for generic double-well systems through a WKB analysis. As a concrete application, the inversion dynamics of the ammonia molecule is analyzed, yielding an inversion frequency of approximately $24$ GHz, in close agreement with experimental observations. These results highlight the potential of stochastic quantization as a powerful and physically insightful framework for analyzing tunneling phenomena in quantum systems."

The primary goal of PTAs is to study gravitational-wave astronomy at nanohertz frequencies, with secondary goals of undertaking other fundamental tests of physics and astronomy. Recently, compelling evidence has emerged in established PTA experiments for the presence of a gravitational-wave background. To accelerate a confident detection of such a signal and then study gravitational-wave emitting sources, it is necessary to observe a larger number of millisecond pulsars to greater timing precision. The SKAO telescopes, which will be a factor of three to four greater in sensitivity compared to any other southern hemisphere facility, are poised to make such an impact. In this chapter, we motivate an SKAO pulsar timing array (SKAO PTA) experiment. We discuss the classes of gravitational waves present in PTA observations and how an SKAO PTA can detect and study them. We then describe the sources that can produce these signals. We discuss the astrophysical noise sources that must be mitigated to undertake the most sensitive searches. We then describe a realistic PTA experiment implemented with the SKA and place it in context alongside other PTA experiments likely ongoing in the 2030s. We describe the techniques necessary to search for gravitational waves in the SKAO PTA and motivate how very long baseline interferometry can improve the sensitivity of an SKAO PTA. The SKAO PTA will provide a view of the Universe complementary to those of the other large facilities of the 2030s."

Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $γ_{i\\in\\{1,2\\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $γ_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $γ_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters."

The analysis examines co usage trends, domain specific deployments, and empirical benchmarking practices using standard suites such as TPCx Kafka and the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, as well as custom workloads. The study highlights significant inconsistencies in configuration disclosure, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility that limit cross study comparison and practical replication. By providing a unified taxonomy, pattern benchmark matrix, and actionable decision heuristics, this work offers practical guidance for architects and researchers designing reproducible, high performance, and fault tolerant Kafka based event streaming systems."

Here we follow the light-induced fragmentation of Br$_2$ using a coincidence-based multi-messenger approach. A UV pulse prepares the dissociative state, and strong-field ionization probes the evolving system. Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling. Supported by semiclassical modelling, the results show that the stretched Br$_2$ molecule behaves as a two-centre interferometer in which the loss of coherence between atomic centres encodes the coupled evolution of electrons and nuclei. Our work establishes a general framework for imaging ultrafast electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules."

It computes the exact pairing eigenvalues and eigenvectors directly from the general nuclear pairing Hamiltonian, represented using SU(2) quasi-spin algebra with basis vectors in binary representation, at zero temperature for both odd and even deformed nucleon systems. In this initial release, the sparsity and symmetry of the pairing matrix are exploited for the first time to quickly construct the pairing matrix. The ARPACK and LAPACK packages are employed for the diagonalization of large- and small-scale sparse matrices, respectively. In addition, the calculation speed for odd nucleon systems is significantly improved by employing a novel technique to accurately identify the block containing the ground state in odd configurations. To ensure the high numerical stability, the Kahan compensation algorithm is employed. The current version of the EP code can efficiently expand the computational space to handle up to 26 doubly folded (deformed) single-particle levels and 26 nucleons on a standard desktop computer in approximately $10^2$ seconds with double precision. With sufficient computational resources, the code can process up to 63 deformed single-particle levels, which can accomodate from 1 to 63 nucleon pairs.

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting."

The core of this protocol involves continuous-variable Bell measurements performed by an untrusted third party. However, in high-speed systems, spectrum broadening causes Bell measurements to deviate from the ideal single-mode scenario, resulting in mode mismatches, reduced performance, and compromised security. Here, we introduce temporal modes (TMs) to analyze the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios. The mismatch between Bob's transmitting mode and Bell measurement mode has a more significant effect on system performance compared to that on Alice's side. When the Bell receiver is close to Bob and the mismatch is set to just 5%, the transmission distance drastically decreases from 87.96 km to 18.50 km. In comparison, the same mismatch for Alice reduces the distance to 86.83 km. This greater degradation on Bob's side can be attributed to the asymmetry in the data modification step. Furthermore, the mismatch in TM characteristics leads to a significant reduction in the secret key rate by 83% when the transmission distance is set to 15 km, which severely limits the practical usability of the protocol over specific distances. These results indicate that in scenarios involving continuous-mode interference, such as large-scale MDI network setups, careful consideration of each user's TM characteristics is crucial. Rigorous pre-calibration of these modes is essential to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency."

The contribution of singlet channel involving the new non-perturbative gluon form factor of virtual photon $B(q^2)$ is systematically taken into account. The detailed analysis of its dependence on photon virtuality $q^2$ relying on the available data for meson transition fomfactors is performed. It is shown that B has quite a nontrivial structure at $q^2 \\sim 1 GeV^2$ which may be a signal of the existence of pseudoscalar glueball with a mass about 1.5-2 GeV. The calculation of the decay to $ν\\bar ν$ pairs leads to the compatibility with the result of Arnellos, Marciano and Parsa of 1982, when pion decay is considered neglecting the mixing effects. The account for these effects results, however, in the enhancement of pion branching ratio by a factor of 3, while that for eta decay is larger by several orders of magnitude. It is stressed, that dependence on the pair invariant mass is entirely defined by QCD and coincides with that of the meson transition form factor.

    "abstract": "To establish a self-consistent effective one-body (EOB) theory that describes the dynamical evolution of binary systems based on the post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation, where the Hamiltonian, radiation reaction force, and waveforms are derived from an effective metric, the primary objective is to obtain the effective metric. Given that third generation gravitational wave detectors require at least fifth-order PM accuracy, in this paper we constructed an effective metric in the EOB theory of binaries up to fifth PM order. The effective metric is of type D, allowing for the derivation of decoupled and variable-separable equations for the null tetrad component of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor. This presents a basis for us to establish a self-consistent EOB theory up to 5PM order."

    "abstract": "Education literature recommends many different strategies for structuring student group work in labs. Many of these strategies, however, have not been sufficiently evaluated for their effects on student outcomes. One prior study suggested that sharing roles, rather than splitting roles, in lab groups can boost students' physics interest and self-efficacy. Here, we expand upon this literature by evaluating the effects of a broader range of role distributions across several student outcomes from a large sample at two different institutions. We developed a survey item to probe the ways students distribute their roles in lab groups. The item asks for the percent of time in lab they spent working together on lab roles (sharing), working alone on roles but rotating each session (rotating), and working alone in the same role throughout the semester (splitting). We employed hierarchical linear modeling to measure the effects of these role distributions on student critical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived agency, belonging, and sense of recognition based on survey items specific to physics lab contexts. We found that role distributions did not differentially impact student critical thinking. We also found that sharing roles tended to have a positive impact on student attitudes; splitting had a negative effect on attitudes; and rotating fell in between. Statistical significance varied across these attitudinal outcomes. Our findings invite further research and controlled studies to better understand the apparent benefits of sharing, rotating, and splitting roles in introductory physics labs."

Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability."

MgO HNTs were synthesized through an electrodeposition process and characterized by scanning electron microscopy to confirm successful surface modification. Growth experiments using Heirloom Cherry Tomato and Golden Tomato seeds were conducted under hydroponic and soil based conditions and subsequently extended to lunar and Martian regolith simulants. A response surface methodology approach based on a Box Behnken design was used to evaluate the effects of temperature, MgO HNT concentration, and light duration on multiple growth responses. Seedling length and the root length stress tolerance index were identified as the most responsive indicators of MgO HNT treatment. Optimal conditions consisting of 25 C, 12 h light exposure, and 100 mg per L MgO HNTs produced the greatest increases in root and shoot length in Earth soil simulants. Validation experiments in extraterrestrial regolith analogs showed that MgO HNTs supported germination, root penetration, and overall seedling vigor under nutrient limited and high stress conditions. Lunar regolith exhibited maximal root development at 100 mg per L, whereas Martian regolith showed optimal growth at 10 mg per L, reflecting differences in mineral composition and oxidative characteristics. These findings demonstrate that MgO HNTs can enhance early plant development across both terrestrial and extraterrestrial substrates and support their potential use as nanomaterial based amendments for sustainable plant cultivation in Earth and space environments."

While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \\toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \\toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

We show that those are essentially the only limitations on the existence of good locally testable codes (LTCs). That is, there are good $2$-query LTCs on any alphabet with more than $2$ letters, and good $3$-query LTCs with a binary alphabet. Similarly, there are good $3$-query $\\mathbb{F}$-linear LTCs, and for every $\\mathbb{F}$-vector space $V$ of dimension greater than $1$, there are good $2$-query LTCs with alphabet $V$ whose tester is $\\mathbb{F}$-linear.

Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models."

This paper thus propose an improved design, BondMM-A, which supports lending activities of any maturity.

Experimental results show that BondMM-A performs excellently in terms of interest rate stability and financial robustness."

    "abstract": "The performance of modern software systems is critically dependent on their complex configuration options. Building accurate performance models to navigate this vast space requires effective sampling strategies, yet existing methods often struggle with multi-objective optimization and cannot leverage semantic information from documentation. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivates the central question of this work: Can LLMs serve as effective samplers for multi-objective performance modeling? To explore this, we present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the capabilities and characteristics of LLM-driven sampling. We design and implement LLM4Perf, a feedback-based framework, and use it to systematically evaluate the LLM-guided sampling process across four highly configurable, real-world systems. Our study reveals that the LLM-guided approach outperforms traditional baselines in most cases. Quantitatively, LLM4Perf achieves the best performance in nearly 68.8% (77 out of 112) of all evaluation scenarios, demonstrating its superior effectiveness. We find this effectiveness stems from the LLM's dual capabilities of configuration space pruning and feedback-driven strategy refinement. The effectiveness of this pruning is further validated by the fact that it also improves the performance of the baseline methods in nearly 91.5% (410 out of 448) of cases. Furthermore, we show how the LLM choices for each component and hyperparameters within LLM4Perf affect its effectiveness. Overall, this paper provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of LLMs in performance engineering and offers concrete insights into the mechanisms that drive their success."

We study four different types of reoptimization for (weighted) SetCover: adding a set, removing a set, adding an element to the universe, and removing an element from the universe. A few of these cases are known to be easier to approximate than the classic SetCover problem. We show that all the other cases are essentially as hard to approximate as SetCover. The reoptimization problem of adding and removing an element in the unweighted case is known to admit a PTAS. For these settings we show that there is no EPTAS under common hardness assumptions via a novel combination of the classic way to show that a reoptimization problem is NP-hard and the relation between EPTAS and FPT."

This is independent of potential shape or kinetic structure and rules out broad classes of canonical and non canonical models, leaving only near Lambda CDM behavior or fully decoupled fields as viable late time scalar dark energy, thereby leaving cosmological constant and minimally coupled scalar field models as the most consistent dark energy regimes. We also use results from Lunar Laser Ranging and photon trajectories to further strengthen our the depth of our constraints."

We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available."

Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control."

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems."

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/"

Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation.

    "abstract": "Natural language (NL) to temporal logic (TL) translation enables engineers to specify, verify, and enforce system behaviors without manually crafting formal specifications-an essential capability for building trustworthy autonomous systems. While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\\%$, a $1.4\\times$ improvement over SOTA."

    "abstract": "Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful seismic imaging technique used to estimate high-resolution physical properties of subsurface structures by minimizing the misfit between observed and modeled seismic data. FWI is inherently a highly non-linear and ill-posed inverse problem. Extended-source approaches, such as the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method, are employed to improve solution convexity and robustness. A key component of this formulation is the penalty parameter, which controls the trade-off between data fitting and satisfaction of the wave-equation constraint, strongly influencing convergence in the presence of noise. The main challenge lies in selecting the penalty parameter. Traditional strategies such as the Discrepancy Principle (DP) require an accurate estimate of the noise level, which is often unknown or poorly characterized. Moreover, trial-and-error tuning requires repeatedly solving the inverse problem, making it computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations and develop a parameter-free, computationally efficient extended-source FWI algorithm, we integrate two data-driven parameter-selection strategies--the Residual Whiteness Principle (RWP) and a stable variant of Generalized Cross-Validation (RGCV)--within a multiplier-oriented AL framework. Specifically, we adopt a dual-space AL formulation, which allows the background wave-equation operator to remain fixed and requires only a single LU factorization per frequency, significantly improving efficiency. This design enables dynamic adjustment of the parameter at negligible cost during iterations, making the algorithm scalable for large-scale applications. Numerical experiments on acoustic and elastic FWI with white and colored noise show that, combined with the dual-space formulation, RWP provides strong noise robustness, resulting in a reliable automated solution for large-scale seismic inversion."

    "abstract": "The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new near-infrared time-domain survey instrument installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of the recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for near-infrared photometry without cryogenic cooling. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a >1 degree-squared field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory."

    "abstract": "We investigate the statistical correlation between the first-reaction time of a diffusing particle and its boundary local time accumulated until the reaction event. Since the reaction event occurs after multiple encounters of the particle with a partially reactive boundary, the boundary local time as a proxy for the number of such encounters is not independent of, but intrinsically linked to, the first-reaction time. We propose a universal theoretical framework to derive their joint probability density and, in particular, the correlation coefficient. To illustrate the dependence of these correlations on the boundary reactivity and shape, we obtain explicit analytical solutions for several basic domains. The analytical results are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations, which we employ to examine the role of interior obstacles on correlations in disordered media. Applications of these statistical results in chemical physics are discussed"

These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system."

    "abstract": "With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation."

In this case $(S,T,U)$ is called a TPP triple of $G$ and $|S||T||U|$ is called the size of the triple. The triple product ratio of $G$ can be defined as the quantity $ρ(G) := \\frac{β(G)}{|G|}$, where $β(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$, and a special case of this, the subgroup triple product ratio, is the quantity $ρ_0(G) := \\frac{β_0(G)}{|G|}$, where $β_0(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$ composed only of subgroups. There is a conjecture that $ρ(G) \\leq \\frac{4}{3}$ if $G$ contains a cyclic subgroup of index $2$. This note proves a version of this conjecture for subgroups by showing that $ρ_0(G) \\leq \\frac{p^2}{2p-1}$ if $G$ is any group which contains an abelian normal subgroup of prime index $p$."

    "abstract": "In an ultrafast optical-pump terahertz-probe measurement, the photoinduced material response can be modulated on a timescale shorter than the extent of the THz pulse. In this situation, the measured time-frequency response deviates from a simple time-dependent linear response. When full two-dimensional time-frequency maps are measured, this yields complex features that can be incorrectly assigned to a photoexcited coherent response. We investigate this experimentally via the measured response of photoexcited SnSe, whereby photoinduced phase change dynamics lead to ultrafast changes of the charge carrier and lattice optical conductivity response. Two-dimensional time-frequency THz transmission maps subsequently show unexpected time-frequency features at early pump-probe delay times. These features are reproduced in both finite-difference time-domain simulations of the THz experiment and in an extension of non-equilibrium response function theory, demonstrating their systematic origin. This work improves the understanding of systematic effects in high time resolution optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy, and explores the conditions in which they are likely to appear."

However, radio surveys searching for pulsations have not yet revealed bulge millisecond pulsars. Identifying promising bulge millisecond pulsar candidates is key to motivating pointed radio pulsation searches. Candidates are often selected among steep-spectrum or polarized radio sources, but multiwavelength information can also be exploited: The aim of this work is to pinpoint strong candidates among the yet unidentified X-ray sources. We investigated the multiwavelength counterparts of sources detected by the Chandra X-ray observatory that have spectral properties expected for millisecond pulsars in the Galactic bulge. We considered that ultraviolet, optical, and strong infrared counterparts indicate that an X-ray source is not a bulge pulsar, while a radio or a faint infrared counterpart makes it a promising candidate. We identify a large population of more than a thousand X-ray sources without optical, ultraviolet, or strong infrared counterparts. Among them, five are seen for the first time in unpublished radio imaging data from the Very Large Array. We provide the list of promising candidates, for most of which follow-up pulsation searches are ongoing."

Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available."

    "abstract": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) with neural posterior estimation (NPE) provides rapid X-ray spectral fitting in both Gaussian and Poisson regimes by learning approximate parameter posteriors from simulations. We investigate auto-encoders for compressing high-resolution X-ray spectra, motivated by newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU), and use likelihood-based importance sampling to refine NPE outputs. Our auto-encoder maps spectra to a low-dimensional latent space and is trained with a custom loss equal to the Cash statistic (C-stat) between simulated and reconstructed spectra. A neural density estimator is then trained on the latent representations. Both models are trained in multiple rounds: at each round, new simulations are drawn from a truncated proposal concentrated around the observation, improving efficiency as the proposal contracts. After NPE convergence, we apply likelihood-based importance sampling to correct the learned posterior. To assess information retention, we train a diagnostic network that predicts the original spectral parameters from the latent space, and we also train a network to learn the likelihood directly to accelerate importance sampling. On X-IFU-like simulations, the auto-encoder and multi-round NPE outperforms PCA and hand-crafted spectral summaries in accuracy and robustness. After importance sampling, the resulting posteriors are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with nested sampling. On a standard laptop, the full pipeline (simulation, compression, inference, correction) delivers 10x speedups. We further demonstrate the approach on XRISM/Resolve and on lower-resolution NICER and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data, confirming applicability across instruments and resolutions. Overall, NPE on compressed spectra paired with likelihood-based importance sampling offers an exact yet efficient alternative for Bayesian X-ray spectral fitting."

Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems."

This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches."

However, nonlocality is a statement about static correlations only. It does not take into account dynamics, i.e. time evolution of those correlations. Consider a dynamic situation where the correlations remain local for all times. Then at each moment in time there exists a local hidden-variable (LHV) model reproducing the momentary correlations. Can the time evolution of the correlations then be captured by evolving the hidden variables? In this light, we define dynamical LHV models and motivate and discuss potential additional physical and mathematical assumptions. Based on a simple counter example we conjecture that such LHV dynamics does not always exist. This is further substantiated by a rigorous no-go theorem. Our results suggest a new type of nonlocality that can be deduced from the observed time evolution of measurement statistics and which generically occurs in interacting quantum systems."

Through Friedrich Wintgen interference, the losses of a two port cavity are tuned until achieving critical coupling, yielding narrowband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) with a quality factor of 140. Additionally, by coupling two distinct resonators, we observe the emergence of an EP, where both eigenvalues simultaneously coalesce and vanish, resulting in narrowband unidirectional absorption.

Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous. In this article, we study in this framework how a Hawking particle moves in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime by computing its propagator.

To quantitatively assess agreement with Earth elevation data, we compile a large dataset of topographic profiles of islands (N=131,063 with the range of areas covering 8+ orders of magnitude) and obtain four estimates for the Hurst exponent of Earth's surface by fitting four statistical laws from the theory of self-affine surfaces concerning islands: (i) distribution of areas, (ii) volume-area relationship, (iii) perimeter-area relationship, and (iv) maximum height-area relationship.

It is well known, however, that it is not mechanically strong against delamination in the direction normal to its surface due to its intrinsic layered structure. Therefore, conductor delamination is one of the major design challenges for REBCO magnet coils. As a part of the development of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL), a dry-wound resistive-insulation-nested-coils (RINC) was designed to reach 25.8 T. It used surface-treated stainless-steel tape as a co-wind to control the turn-to-turn contact resistance, and was fabricated and tested in a liquid helium bath. During the test, two of the double pancake modules exhibited resistive transitions at a current significantly lower than the designed value. The postmortem inspection of the REBCO conductor of these modules by reel-to-reel magnetization at 77 K found sections of very low critical current. Further investigations of one section by chemical etching, visual inspection, and electron microscopy revealed that conductor of this section was delaminated. We present the detailed findings of these postmortem characterizations. The implication of this type of delamination for future magnet designs will be discussed."

Herwig 7 provides a flexible and systematically improvable framework for the simulation of high-energy lepton and hadron collisions, with particular emphasis on QCD and EW effects. Hard scattering processes are generated within the automated Matchbox framework, which integrates external amplitude providers, supports tree-level, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and loop-induced matrix elements, and implements subtraction schemes, multi-channel phase-space sampling, dynamic scale choices and both POWHEG- and MC@NLO-type matching algorithms. Consistent multijet merging at LO and NLO is provided, enabling precise predictions across a wide range of SM processes. Parton radiation is simulated using two complementary showers: an angular-ordered shower incorporating QCD coherence and the heavy-quark dead-cone effect, and a dipole shower optimised for NLO matching and multijet merging. Higher-order corrections are included through matrix-element corrections and dedicated reweighting techniques, while QED and EW radiation are treated using a YFS formalism and EW showering algorithms. The modelling of non-perturbative physics employs an advanced cluster hadronization framework with improved cluster formation, fission and decay, as well as colour reconnection models, heavy-quark effects and interfaces to alternative hadronization schemes. An extended eikonal multiple-partonic-scattering model, incorporating semi-hard and soft components together with diffractive interactions, enables realistic descriptions of minimum-bias and underlying-event data. Herwig 7 thus represents a versatile event generator, providing a coherent, modular and extensible platform for Standard Model and beyond-the-Standard-Model collider phenomenology at current and future facilities."

    "abstract": "To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The high-radiation regions of the the CE, where fluences between $1\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses of up to 2\\,MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of $3\\,ab^{-1}$, will be equipped with silicon pad sensors. This includes the entire electromagnetic as well as parts of the hadronic section of the CE. The silicon sensors are processed on 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300\\,\\textmu m, 200\\,\\textmu m and 120\\,\\textmu m and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the full wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor, several small test structures (e.g. pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5°C and 60°C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model."

    "abstract": "This study examines the complex interplay between inertia and time delay in regular rotor networks within the framework of the second-order Kuramoto model. By combining analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate that intrinsic time delays -- arising from finite information transmission speeds - induce multistability among fully synchronized phase-locked states. Unlike systems without inertia, the presence of inertia destabilizes these phase-locked states, reduces their basin of attraction, and gives rise to nonlinear phase-locked dynamics over specific inertia ranges. In addition, we show that time delays promote the emergence of turbulent chimera states, while inertia enhances their spatial extent. Notably, the combined influence of inertia and time delay produces dynamic patterns reminiscent of partial epileptic seizures. These findings provide new insights into synchronization phenomena by revealing how inertia and time delay fundamentally reshape the stability and dynamics of regular rotor networks, with broader implications for neuronal modeling and other complex systems."

However, when computational resources are severely limited, as in battery-powered tools with embedded processors, existing approaches struggle to meet real-time requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of real-time torque control for impact wrenches, where high-frequency control updates are necessary to accurately track the fast transients occurring during periodic impact events, while maintaining high-performance safety-critical control that mitigates harmful vibrations and component wear. The key novelty of the approach is that we combine data-driven model augmentation through Gaussian process regression with neural network approximation of the resulting control policy. This insight allows us to deploy predictive control on resource-constrained embedded platforms while maintaining both constraint satisfaction and microsecond-level inference times. The proposed framework is evaluated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments on a custom impact wrench testbed. The results show that our approach successfully achieves real-time control suitable for high-frequency operation while maintaining constraint satisfaction and improving tracking accuracy compared to baseline PID control."

We present and analyse an efficient strategy for our setting and guarantee a competitive ratio of less than 9.12725 in the worst case and also prove a lower bound of at least 9.06357 for any strategy. Thus the given strategy is almost optimal, the gap is less than 0.06368.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA"

However, traditional protective structures typically suffer from limitations such as excessive thickness and inadequate load-bearing capacity. Guided by the design concepts of debris-cloud deflection and hierarchical energy dissipation, this study proposes a trajectory-planning lattice protective structure. First, the lattice parameters and geometry were designed according to the functional relationship between the incident angle and the transmitted/ricochet trajectory angles. Subsequently, multi-angle hypervelocity impact experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed lattice protection structure. In combination with post-impact CT three-dimensional reconstruction and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations, the protective mechanisms of the lattice structure were systematically characterized and clarified. The results demonstrate that, for three oblique incidence conditions, the lattice structure remained intact and significantly deflected the debris-cloud momentum direction while effectively dissipating its kinetic energy. The angled plates with gradient designs enabled continuous changes in the momentum direction and stepwise kinetic energy dissipation through multiple cycles of debrisation, dispersion, and trajectory deflection. This research presents a novel, engineering-ready approach for spacecraft MMOD protection and validates the potential of trajectory-planning lattice structures for hypervelocity impact defense."

Although future fusion devices essentially need to incorporate strategies to minimise disruption occurrence, complete avoidance remains unattainable. Consequently, assessing and characterising unmitigated disruption consequences is fundamental for the design and qualification of next-generation fusion power plants. This work supports the pre-conceptual design of ST-E1, a low aspect-ratio Tokamak Fusion Power Plant developed by Tokamak Energy Ltd., by presenting a comprehensive disruption modelling approach applied across different design stages. The methodology integrates both physics and engineering considerations to evaluate the impact of disruptions on machine performance and structural integrity. From an engineering perspective, several ST-E1 layout options were analysed to investigate the electromagnetic response of key components under disruption-induced loads, enabling comparison between alternative design solutions. On the physics side, a broad set of disruption scenarios was explored, scanning operational space parameters, plasma-material interactions, and associated thermal loads. Furthermore, the study examined variations in disruption behaviour arising from different reference equilibria, focusing on a range starting from Double Null to Single Null configurations, reflecting the increasing up-down asymmetry consequences. The results reveal significant contrasts in plasma dynamics and structures electromagnetic behaviour between configurations, highlighting the importance of disruption modelling in guiding design choices. These analyses have proven instrumental in shaping ST-E1 development, offering critical insights for mitigating risks and optimising future fusion reactor designs."

    "abstract": "Wildfires pose an increasingly severe threat to air quality, yet quantifying their causal impact remains challenging due to unmeasured meteorological and geographic confounders. Moreover, wildfire impacts on air quality may exhibit heterogeneous effects across pollution levels, which conventional mean-based causal methods fail to capture. To address these challenges, we develop a Quantile-based Latent Spatial Confounder Model (QLSCM) that substitutes conditional expectations with conditional quantiles, enabling causal analysis across the entire outcome distribution. We establish the causal interpretation of QLSCM theoretically, prove the identifiability of causal effects, and demonstrate estimator consistency under mild conditions. Simulations confirm the bias correction capability and the advantage of quantile-based inference over mean-based approaches. Applying our method to contiguous US wildfire and air quality data, we uncover important heterogeneous effects: fire radiative power exerts significant positive causal effects on aerosol optical depth at high quantiles in Western states like California and Oregon, while insignificant at lower quantiles. This indicates that wildfire impacts on air quality primarily manifest during extreme pollution events. Regional analyses reveal that Western and Northwestern regions experience the strongest causal effects during such extremes. These findings provide critical insights for environmental policy by identifying where and when mitigation efforts would be most effective."

As a result, we arrive at the expression for anomaly, which has a rich general structure, typical for the dimensions $D \\geq 4$.

Joel Mokyr has argued that self-sustained modern economic growth originated from a feedback loop between propositional (theoretical) and prescriptive (applied) knowledge, which turned positive in the eighteenth century during the \"Industrial Enlightenment\". While influential, this thesis has never been directly tested. This paper provides the first quantitative evidence by estimating the impact of knowledge spillovers between propositional and prescriptive knowledge on innovation in England, 1600-1800. For this, it introduces two new text-based measures for 1) the innovativeness of publications and 2) knowledge spillovers. The paper finds strong evidence that a feedback loop between propositional and prescriptive knowledge became positive during the second half of the eighteenth century. It also documents that this process had positive effects on the real economy as measured through patents. Overall, the findings provide empirical support for Mokyr's original hypothesis."

It has been studied for several classes of finitely generated groups, including free groups, linear groups and virtually abelian groups. In this paper, we focus on $\\text{RF}_G$ for the class of nilpotent groups, leading to three different results. First, we demonstrate that this function does not change when taking finite index subgroups within this class, so it forms a commensurability invariant. Next, we introduce a similar function on nilpotent Lie rings and show that every group corresponds to a nilpotent Lie ring with an equivalent residual finiteness growth. Finally, we define a new residual finiteness growth function by restricting to normal subgroups $N$ such that $G^p \\subset N \\subset G$ for some prime number $p$. After computing this new function for all finitely generated nilpotent groups, we show that it is equal to the earlier upper bound for $\\text{RF}_G$ established in the literature and which was conjectured to be exact."

Existing methods typically construct sparser views by randomly perturbing the original interaction graph, as they have no idea about the authentic user preferences. Owing to the sparse nature of recommendation data, this paradigm can only capture insufficient semantic information. To address the issue, we propose InfoDCL, a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework for recommendation. Rather than injecting randomly sampled Gaussian noise, we employ a single-step diffusion process that integrates noise with auxiliary semantic information to generate signals and feed them to the standard diffusion process to generate authentic user preferences as contrastive views. Besides, based on a comprehensive analysis of the mutual influence between generation and preference learning in InfoDCL, we build a collaborative training objective strategy to transform the interference between them into mutual collaboration. Additionally, we employ multiple GCN layers only during inference stage to incorporate higher-order co-occurrence information while maintaining training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that InfoDCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our InfoDCL offers an effective solution for enhancing recommendation performance and suggests a novel paradigm for applying diffusion method in contrastive learning frameworks."

When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence.

Within applied measurement theory, the preservation of symmetries in transformation groups acting on score frequency distributions ensure invariance in transformed distributions, with implications for validity, comparability, and conservation of information. A simulation study demonstrates how breaks in measurement symmetry affect score distribution symmetry and break effect size comparability. Practical applications are considered, particularly in meta analysis, where the standardized mean difference (SMD) is shown to remain invariant across measures only under specific symmetry conditions derived from the Lie group model. These results underscore symmetry as a unifying principle in measurement theory and its role in evidence based research."

This study explores ML to predict the size of Cu NPs from microwave-assisted polyol synthesis using a small data set of 25 in-house performed syntheses. Latin Hypercube Sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space while creating the experimental data set. Ensemble regression models, built with the AMADEUS framework, successfully predict particle sizes with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.74$), outperforming classical statistical approaches ($R^2 = 0.60$). Overall, this study highlights that, for lab-scale synthesis optimization, high-quality small datasets combined with classical, interpretable ML models outperform traditional statistical methods and are fully sufficient for quantitative synthesis prediction.

In this work, we develop a low-complexity framework that integrates the Woodbury (WB) formula with adaptive randomized singular value decomposition (arSVD) to efficiently update the Gram matrix inverse as the satellite moves along its orbit. By leveraging low-rank perturbations, the WB formula reduces inversion complexity, while arSVD dynamically extracts dominant singular components, further enhancing computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves computational savings of up to 61\\% compared to conventional RZF precoding with full matrix inversion, while incurring only a modest degradation in sum-rate performance.

We evaluated our approaches with quantitative metrics, such as Flesch-Kincaid grade level, SMOG Index, SARI, and BERTScore, G-Eval, as well as with qualitative metric, more precisely 5-point Likert scales for simplicity, accuracy, completeness, brevity. Results showed a superior performance of gpt-4o-mini and an underperformance of FT approaches. G-Eval, a LLM based quantitative metric, showed promising results, ranking the approaches similarly as the qualitative metric."

Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon."

However, such transitions have so far been restricted to spatial crystals, relying solely on energy band gaps and spatial interfaces. Here, we transcend this conventional framework and report, for the first time, spatiotemporal topological phase transition in photonic spacetime crystals - structures that are periodically modulated in both space and time. Using a dynamically modulated transmission line metamaterial, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate complete spatiotemporal topological phase transitions characterized by the closing and reopening of both energy and momentum band gaps, alongside changes in spatiotemporal topological invariants and topological phases. Furthermore, in a genuine photonic spacetime crystal that possesses a complete energy-momentum band gap, we directly observe a space-time topological event that localizes in both space and time, exhibiting relativistic-causality-governed excitation and robustness against spatiotemporal disorders. Our findings reveal the interplay among space, time, and topology, establishing a unified framework that provides a comprehensive picture of the emerging topological space-time physics and opening new avenues for robust spatiotemporal topological wave manipulations."

We propose a framework for algorithmic monetary policies that navigates this tradeoff in repeated participation games. Agents, characterized by type (capability) and stake, choose to participate or abstain at each round; the policy (probabilistically) selects high-type agents for task execution (maximizing throughput) while distributing rewards to sustain decentralization. We analyze equilibria under two agent behaviors: myopic (short-term utility maximization) and foresighted (multi-round planning). For myopic agents, performance-centric policies risk centralization, but foresight enables stable decentralization with some volatility to the token value. We further discuss virtual stake--a hybrid of type and stake--as an alternative approach. We show that the initial virtual stake distribution critically impacts long-term outcomes, suggesting that policies must indirectly manage decentralization."

The radial harmonic oscillator problem with position-dependent mass is shown to exhibit a deformed shape invariance property in a deformed supersymmetric framework. The inverse point canonical transformation then provides some exactly-solvable rational extensions of the radial harmonic oscillator with position-dependent mass associated with $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III. The extended potentials of type I and II are proved to display deformed shape invariance. The spectrum and wavefunctions of the radial harmonic oscillator potential and its extensions are shown to go over to well-known results when the deforming parameter $α$ goes to zero."

    "abstract": "In condensed-matter physics, long-range correlations introduce quantum states of matter that challenge intuition. For instance, supersolids combine symmetry-breaking crystalline structure, i.e. density order, and frictionless superfluid flow. Envisioned over fifty years ago, supersolids have proven to only exist under very stringent conditions, with experimental evidence limited to few observations. Many-body phases with supersolid properties in fact reduce to a few recent observations for weakly interacting Bose gases. Here, we demonstrate a new framework to realize supersolid crystals in the strong interaction regime, by confining dipolar bosons in a lattice with long-range hopping. We study dipolar excitons that genuinely realize this lattice model. At fractional lattice fillings - 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 - we report mesoscopic quantum solids, across over 100 sites, spontaneously breaking translational symmetry. At the same time, we show that off-diagonal long-range order is induced by long-range hopping, such that exciton solids are superfluids. State-of-the-art numerical methods quantitatively confirm that supersolidity builds up in the ground-state of the lattice Hamiltonian. Our studies of strongly-correlated supersolid crystals open new frontiers for exploration in condensed matter physics."

Our work removes the existing theoretical gap between the classical solution of the Maxwell equations for guided fields and the intuitive understanding of photons in waveguides.

    "abstract": "The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW."

Then we introduce a new family of graphs called the extended Hamming graph, denoted by $EH(n,2^n)$, which is constructed from the well-known Hamming graph $H(n,2^n)$. The graph $EH(n,2^n)$ shares the same vertex set as $H(n,2^n)$ but includes additional edges, called complementary edges, connecting each $n$-tuple vertex $u$ to its complement $u^c$, where $u^c$ is defined such that the sum of each two corresponding coordinates of $u$ and $u^c$ equals $2^n-1$. We investigate several algebraic and structural properties of this new family of graphs. Specifically, we show that the diameter of $EH(n,2^n)$ is $n$. We prove that $EH(n,2^n)$ is a Cayley graph, but we demonstrate that it is not a distance regular graph. Finally, we determine the spectrum of $EH(n,2^n)$, showing that its eigenvalues are $λ_i\\pm 1$, where $λ_i$ are the eigenvalues of the underlying Hamming graph $H(n,2^n)$. The multiplicity of each eigenvalue is explicitly calculated."

    "abstract": "Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research."

Assuming the existence of the critical point, this reduces its possible range. The proof relies on a modification of the usual Glauber dynamics of the model, which enables stochastic bounds of FK measures between two inhomegenous percolations. We also prove uniqueness of the infinite-volume measure in our extended ranges. Most of our results are valid in any dimension $d \\geq 2$ and beyond hypercubic lattices."

Traditional approaches for identifying clusters of survival curves often rely on computationally intensive bootstrap techniques to approximate the null hypothesis distribution. While effective, these methods impose significant computational burdens. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the k-means and log-rank test to efficiently identify and cluster survival curves. Our method eliminates the need for computationally expensive resampling, significantly reducing processing time while maintaining statistical reliability. By systematically evaluating survival curves and determining optimal clusters, the proposed method ensures a practical and scalable alternative for large-scale survival data analysis. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves results comparable to existing bootstrap-based clustering methods while dramatically improving computational efficiency. These findings suggest that the log-rank-based clustering procedure offers a viable and time-efficient solution for researchers working with multiple survival curves in medical and epidemiological studies."

We find that Hawking radiation is generated dynamically near the black hole horizon and freely propagates out to null infinity, resulting in an outgoing energy flux that builds up from zero at early retarded times before the black hole forms. This resolves the long-standing issue of pre-Hawking radiation, suffered by calculations based on a static approximation to the stress tensor in an Unruh state, and paves the way towards four-dimensional black hole evolution with semiclassical back-reaction included."

Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed. Extensive simulations validate the proposed joint aRIS deployment and beamforming framework, demonstrating substantial UWA channel capacity improvements-up to 265% and 170% in shallow-sea and deep-sea scenarios, respectively."

However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \\href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years."

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the superior capabilities of large language models in natural language understanding and generation, Embeddings-as-a-Service (EaaS) has emerged as a successful commercial paradigm on the web platform. However, prior studies have revealed that EaaS is vulnerable to imitation attacks. Existing methods protect the intellectual property of EaaS through watermarking techniques, but they all ignore the most important properties of embedding: semantics, resulting in limited harmlessness and stealthiness. To this end, we propose SemMark, a novel semantic-based watermarking paradigm for EaaS copyright protection. SemMark employs locality-sensitive hashing to partition the semantic space and inject semantic-aware watermarks into specific regions, ensuring that the watermark signals remain imperceptible and diverse. In addition, we introduce the adaptive watermark weight mechanism based on the local outlier factor to preserve the original embedding distribution. Furthermore, we propose Detect-Sampling and Dimensionality-Reduction attacks and construct four scenarios to evaluate the watermarking method. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular NLP datasets, and SemMark achieves superior verifiability, diversity, stealthiness, and harmlessness."

    "abstract": "Four decades after Richard Feynman's famous remark, we have reached a stage at which nature can be simulated quantum mechanically. Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired approaches for scaling to larger molecular systems and for future applications in chemistry and materials science."

    "abstract": "Inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks such as parameter estimation are computationally demanding whenever dealing with physics-based models, and typically require repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers. When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations. This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."

Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning."

Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity."

We address these challenges by proposing a noise and reverberation-augmented training strategy to improve tokenizer robustness.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches."

We derive the full 3D effective action and show that, for the observed Higgs mass $m_{h}=125$ GeV, the radion potential admits a stable minimum, near-zero vacuum energy. By imposing the non-supersymmetric AdS instability conjecture as a quantum gravity consistency requirement, we obtain a model independent bound on the heavy Higgs sector, finding that the additional scalar states must satisfy $M_{H}\\gtrsim 680$ GeV to avoid an unstable AdS$_{3}$ vacuum. Our results demonstrate how Swampland inspired constraints can yield sharp, phenomenologically testable predictions for extended Higgs sectors."

The resulting empirical likelihood-based prediction-powered inference (EPI) estimator is asymptotically normal, has asymptotic variance no larger than the fully supervised estimator, and attains the semiparametric efficiency bound when the auxiliary functions span the predictable component of the supervised score. For hypothesis testing and confidence sets, empirical likelihood ratio statistics admit chi-squared-type limiting distributions. As a by-product, the empirical likelihood weights induce a calibrated empirical distribution that integrates supervised and prediction-based information, enabling estimation and uncertainty quantification for general functionals beyond parameters defined by estimating equations. We present two practical implementations: one based on basis expansions in the predictions and covariates, and one that learns an approximately optimal auxiliary function by cross-fitting. In simulations and applications, EPI reduces mean squared error and shortens confidence intervals while maintaining nominal coverage."

Here, we note that the combination of ELT and a space-based starshade would provide the contrast needed to observe potentially tens of Earth analogs, as well as other planets. This would yield the scientific basis needed for addressing central scientific questions regarding the frequency and distribution of habitability and life in the Universe. The huge aperture of ELT, combined with a contrast otherwise only reachable in space, opens up scientific avenues that are unmatched by any other existing or foreseen facility. ESO could conceivably collaborate with ESA (and others) to facilitate a starshade mission suitable for synergy with the ELT, as well as to prepare the ELT instrumentation in order to maximize its potential for synergy with a starshade."

Our proof is purely structural and, therefore, it can be generalised to counting appearances of integers in residue classes of arbitrary arithmetic progressions generated by $k$ different primes using the determinant of a matrix of ones having those $k$ primes on its diagonal. The revealed structure also offers a fast way of calculating such determinants."

    "abstract": "The hazard function is central to the formulation of commonly used survival regression models such as the proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models. However, these models rely on a shared baseline hazard, which, when specified parametrically, can only capture limited shapes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general class of parametric survival regression models obtained by modelling the hazard function using autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Covariate information is incorporated via transformed linear predictors on the parameters of the ODE system. Our framework capitalises on the interpretability of parameters in common ODE systems, enabling the identification of covariate values that produce qualitatively distinct hazard shapes associated with different attractors of the system of ODEs. This provides deeper insights into how covariates influence survival dynamics. We develop efficient Bayesian computational tools, including parallelised evaluation of the log-posterior, which facilitates integration with general-purpose Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. We also derive conditions for posterior asymptotic normality, enabling fast approximations of the posterior. A central contribution of our work lies in the case studies. We demonstrate the methodology using clinical trial data with crossing survival curves, and a study of cancer recurrence times where our approach reveals how the efficacy of interventions (treatments) on hazard and survival are influenced by patient characteristics."

    "abstract": "Generic absoluteness refers to the stability of the set-theoretic universe under forcing expansions. A result by Kripke asserts that every complete Boolean algebra can be completely embedded into a countably generated one. In terms of forcing, this means that every forcing expansion of the universe is contained in one derived by a collapse forcing. The central question of this article is whether some level of generic absoluteness for collapse forcings is equivalent to the same kind of absoluteness for any forcing notion. We solve this question affirmatively under natural determinacy hypotheses, which follow from the existence of large cardinals. The long proof, which combines many set-theoretic techniques, estabilishing new connections within the field. For instance, we generalise the famous proof of Projective Determinacy by Martin and Steel to the context of homogeneity relative to an inner model, as well as giving a new proof of Neeman's optimal Projective Determinacy result."

    "abstract": "We investigate entropy of electron-positron pair production in time-dependent Sauter pulse electric field. Both cases of pair longitudinal momentum only and full momentum consideration are examined. We further examine three types of entropy, one is the usual entanglement entropy $S_{\\text{E}}$, the other two extensions are thermal distribution entropy $S_{\\text{Th}}$, and that with the chemical potential correction, $S_{\\text{Th,CP}}$. For short pulse, $S_{\\text{E}}$ is higher than $S_{\\text{Th}}$ and vice versa for long pulse. The chemical potential causes the single-particle average thermal distribution entropy $\\frac{S_{\\text{Th,CP}}}{N}$ to exhibit non-monotonic behavior, similar to the single-particle average entanglement entropy $\\frac{S_{\\text{E}}}{N}$ in the short-pulse range. In the full momentum case, we calculate the thermal distribution entropy $S_{\\text{Th, U}}$ via introducing the Unruh temperature as the local effective temperature. We find that both $S_{\\text{Th, U}}$ and $S_{\\text{E}}$ saturate asymptotically to the constant while the former has a larger asymptotic value. The results presented in this study reveals that the different entropies have some delicate relationships among them."

The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing."

Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking. Finally, we outline research directions, establishing GOST as a transformative twinning paradigm to guide the development of SAGSIN."

Under a simple discrete orthogonality condition, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an inverse kernel lambda_3 (triangular of the same order) giving the inversion formula x^n = sum_{b=0}^{floor(n/m)} lambda_3(n,b) f_{n-mb}(x). This reindexing principle yields explicit change-of-basis relations between two families, including the case of distinct step sizes m_1 and m_2, with connection coefficients obtained from a universal triangular sum once lambda_3 is known. On the algebraic side, lambda_1 defines a lower Hessenberg matrix M_(n,k) (the algebraic expansion matrix) whose determinant governs inversion, providing closed determinantal expressions for lambda_3(n,k). We introduce a class of lambda-recursive sequences of order m, specified by a principal factor (p_n) and auxiliary factors (h_(n,k)), for which det(M_(n,k)) satisfies a recurrence enabling direct computation of inverse-kernel and basis-change coefficients. Classical families (e.g., Chebyshev, Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre, Fibonacci, Lucas) fit naturally into this framework, unifying their connection coefficients via the same triangular-array computations and supporting structured Clenshaw-type schemes and related applications."

Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving."

First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements.

Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks.

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset."

These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the \"blacks\" label operates partially as a general \"racism detector\" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage."

    "abstract": "Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation."

It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states."

In this work, we construct a Gaussian version of this channel that, given $n$ copies of a bosonic passive Gaussian state, prepares $n$ copies of one of its randomly chosen Gaussian purifications. The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups."

    "abstract": "The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants."

Our method uses simulation-based inference combined with the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) algorithm and cross-correlation-based statistics to compress the data into a vector that is robust to model misspecification and small enough to be amenable to neural posterior estimation with normalizing flows. By leveraging this compressed data representation, our method enables the robust use of the anisotropic and non-Gaussian information in the foreground fields to more accurately separate the CMB polarization signal from these contaminants. Using an idealized ground-based experimental setup inspired by the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes, we demonstrate improved statistical constraining power for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compared to the (constrained) NILC algorithm and improved robustness to complex foregrounds compared to other techniques in the literature. Trained on a relatively simple semi-analytical foreground model, the method yields unbiased $r$ results across a range of PySM Galactic foreground simulations, including the high-complexity d12 model, for which we obtain $r=(1.09 \\pm 0.27)\\cdot 10^{-2}$ for input $r=0.01$ and sky fraction $f_{\\mathrm{sky}} = 0.21$. We thus demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a complete, maps-to-parameters, simulation-based analysis of large-scale CMB polarization for current ground-based observatories."

    "abstract": "Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire."

We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement.

While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications"

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

In parallel, the content of the initiatives is studied through semantic networks based on co-occurrences extracted from short descriptions, and topics by party and period are identified using a stochastic block model for weighted networks, with additional comparison using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. In addition, a Bayesian sociability model is applied to detect terms with robust connectivity and to summarize discursive cores.

    "abstract": "Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content. We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes."

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average."

During such events, the radiative energy of the star is primarily concentrated in the optical and X-ray bands, with the X-ray flux potentially increasing by tens or even hundreds of times. Einstein Probe (EP) detected a new X-ray transient EP J2322.1-0301 on 27 September 2024. Its spatial localization shows a high positional coincidence with the nearby high proper motion K-type star PM J23221-0301. Follow-up X-ray observations confirmed the flux enhancement of the source, while optical spectroscopic monitoring revealed time-variable features, particularly the disappearance of the H-alpha emission line. This X-ray flare is consistent with a characteristic fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) light curve, with a rise timescale of 1.4 ks, a decay timescale of 5.7 ks, and a total duration of about 7.1 ks. The peak luminosity in the 0.5-4.0 keV energy band reached about 1.3 x 10^31 erg s^-1, with a total energy release of about 9.1 x 10^34 erg, consistent with the empirical energy correlations observed in magnetic-reconnection-driven stellar flares, as inferred from the multitemperature plasma structure and H-alpha-X-ray energy correlation.

Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \\(f\\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization.

Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically.

The purpose of RM is to measure the Bragg peak (BP) position for each contributing beam, and detect any changes. Currently, there is no consensus on a clinical RM method, the use of which would improve the safety and consistency of treatment. The prototype filtered IVI (fIVI) Range Monitoring System is the first system to apply large-area and high-rate-capable silicon detectors to IVI. Two layers of these detectors track prompt secondary fragments for use in RM. This device monitored 16 cm and 32 cm diameter cylindrical plastic phantoms irradiated by clinical carbon ion beams at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center. Approximately 20 different BP depths were delivered to each phantom, with a minimum depth difference of 0.8 mm and a maximum depth difference of 51.9 mm and 82.5 mm respectively. For large BP range differences, the relationship between the true depth difference and that measured by fIVI is quadratic, although for small differences, the deviation from a linear relationship with a slope of 1 is negligible. RM performance is strongly dependent on the number of tracked particles, particularly in the clinically-relevant regime. Significant performance differences exist between the two phantoms, with millimetric precision at clinical doses being achieved only for the 16 cm phantom. The performance achieved by the prototype fIVI Range Monitoring System is consistent with previous investigations of IVI, despite measuring at more challenging shallow BP positions. Further significant improvements are possible through increasing the sensitive area of the tracking system beyond the prototype, which will both allow an improvement in precision for the most intense points of a scanned treatment plan and expand the number of points for which millimetric precision may be achieved."

    "abstract": "We analyze enhanced optical transmission through subwavelength aper- tures using a modal formulation for the two fundamental polarizations, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM). Within this frame- work, the fields inside the aperture are described in terms of guided modes whose excitation and interference govern the transmission process. By ex- amining the near-field energy transport through the time-averaged Poynt- ing vector, we show that resonant transmission is accompanied by a pro- nounced reorganization of the energy flow in the vicinity of the aperture. As the wavelength is varied across resonance, the energy transport un- dergoes a topological transition characterized by vortical and saddle-type flow structures, localized backflow regions, and efficient energy funneling through the aperture. These features correlate with strong phase gradi- ents and phase singularities associated with the excited modal fields. The modal approach provides a unified and physically transparent interpre- tation of enhanced transmission in both slits and channels, applicable to perfect conductors and beyond plasmonic regimes."

Data sets obtained using E/A=69-MeV 9C and 13O beams on a Be target have been further analyzed to extend the level scheme of 8B for Ex<10 MeV. New levels were observed in the 2p+6Li, p+3He+alpha, and the p+7Be+gamma exit channels. Momentum correlations between the decay fragments were also investigated in order to deduce the decay pathways and whether the decays are prompt or sequential. This nucleus and its mirror were also investigated in the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model. Correspondence between the newly observed and predicted levels were made based on the level energy and the decay modes. For positive parity levels with J<=3, all predicted levels can be connected to an experimental counter part (as least tentatively) for Ex<8.4 MeV."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {à} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\\subset\\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\\mathbb{H}\\subset\\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\\mathrm{H}\\subset \\mathrm{U}$."

    "abstract": "Epitaxial strain provides a powerful, non-chemical route to tune the properties of functional materials by manipulating the coupling between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials."

In this work, we build on a well-established ePSF modelling framework and its commonly used open-source Python implementation and demonstrate that several simple but effective modifications to existing ePSF modelling routines can significantly improve model accuracy. We use synthetic ePSFs to generate simulated datasets of stellar images, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy of ePSF models and determine the scale of the pixel-phase errors in resulting flux and position measurements. We systematically investigate how specific modelling choices affect ePSF accuracy, and evaluate the influence of oversampling, interpolation, gridpoint estimation, smoothing, star-sample distribution, and dithering on photometric precision. We apply our refined ePSF modelling routine to images from the Global Jet Watch observatories, demonstrating its improved ability to recover an accurate ePSF for real astronomical images. Our findings highlight the importance of tailoring the modelling approach to the specific characteristics of the instrument and detector, as well as to the nature of the available imaging data used to construct the ePSF model. These results provide practical guidance for optimising ePSF construction, thereby improving the reliability of photometric and astrometric measurements."

    "abstract": "The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases."

    "abstract": "Progress in quantum computing and networking depends on codesign across abstraction layers: device-level noise and heterogeneous hardware, algorithmic structure, and distributed classical control. We present QuantumSavory, an open-source toolkit built to make such end-to-end studies practical by cleanly separating a symbolic computer-algebra frontend from interchangeable numerical simulation backends. States, operations, measurements, and protocol logic are expressed in a backend-agnostic symbolic language; the same model can be executed across multiple backends (e.g., stabilizer, wavefunction, phase-space), enabling rapid exploration of accuracy-performance tradeoffs without rewriting the model. Furthermore, new custom backends can be added via a small, well-defined interface that immediately reuses existing models and protocols. QuantumSavory also addresses the classical-quantum interaction inherent to LOCC protocols via discrete-event execution and a tag/query system for coordination. Tags attach structured classical metadata to quantum registers and message buffers, and queries retrieve, filter, or wait on matching metadata by wildcards or arbitrary predicates. This yields a data-driven control plane where protocol components coordinate by publishing and consuming semantic facts (e.g., resource availability, pairing relationships, protocol outcomes) rather than by maintaining rigid object graphs or bespoke message plumbing, improving composability and reuse as models grow. Our toolkit is also not limited to qubits and Bell pairs; rather, any networking dynamics of any quantum system under any type of multipartite entanglement can be tackled. Lastly, QuantumSavory ships reusable libraries of standard states, circuits, and protocol building blocks with consistent interfaces, enabling full-stack examples to be assembled, modified, and compared with minimal glue code."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as epistemic partners in everyday reasoning, yet their errors remain predominantly analyzed through predictive metrics rather than through their interpretive effects on human judgment. This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous. The study provides implications for LLM assessment, digital literacy, and the design of trustworthy human AI communication."

    "abstract": "We study portfolio selection with a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint under distribution shift and serial dependence. While Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) offers tractable protection via an ambiguity ball around empirical data, choosing the ball radius is delicate: large radii are conservative, small radii risk violation under regime change. We propose a shift-aware Gaussian-supremum (GS) validation framework for Wasserstein-DRO CVaR portfolios, building on the work by Lam and Qian (2019). Phase I of the framework generates a candidate path by solving the exact reformulation of the robust CVaR constraint over a grid of Wasserstein radii. Phase II of the framework learns a target deployment law $Q$ by density-ratio reweighting of a time-ordered validation fold, computes weighted CVaR estimates, and calibrates a simultaneous upper confidence band via a block multiplier bootstrap to account for dependence. We select the least conservative feasible portfolio (or abstain if the effective sample size collapses). Theoretically, we extend the normalized GS validator to non-i.i.d. financial data: under weak dependence and regularity of the weighted scores, any portfolio passing our validator satisfies the CVaR limit under $Q$ with probability at least $1-β$; the Wasserstein term contributes a deterministic margin $(δ/α)\\|x\\|_*$. Empirical results indicate improved return-risk trade-offs versus the naive baseline."

The detection of the post-merger gravitational-wave signal from a binary neutron star merger would additionally provide access to finite-temperature properties of the EoS which contain more information about the composition and the interactions of dense matter than the cold EoS alone. In particular deconfined quark matter may be probed by its characteristic finite temperature effects. This is especially the case for color-superconducting phases, in which the quasiparticle contribution to the thermal pressure is exponentially suppressed at low temperatures. Here we develop a new finite $T$ framework to model the thermal EoS for dense quark matter based on the cold quark matter EoS which is useful for numerical relativity simulations. We test the validity of the framework against a three-flavor NJL mean-field calculation, both with and without diquark pairing. We find that even for the complicated phase diagram of the NJL model including multiple different phases the framework is accurate to the few percent level for temperatures up to $T\\sim 50\\,$MeV."

Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency."

We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps."

Its structural evolution versus temperature has been investigated by combining in-situ X-ray and neutron diffraction (XRD and NPD) with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments.Upon heating, the deuteride undergoes a reversible order-disorder transition from an ordered monoclinic structure to a disordered cubic structure between 320 and 380 K.Then, a multipeak thermal desorption occurs between 400 and 550 K, which can be explained by the transitions between different cubic deuterides separated by two-phase ranges. After controlled partial D desorption of TbFe$_{2}$D$_{4.2}$ , the XRD patterns of several TbFe$_{2}$D$_{x}$ deuterides were measured ex-situ using synchrotron radiation at room temperature, revealing the formation of different phases with cubic or monoclinic structures separated by two phase ranges.A tetragonal superstructure was observed for a phase with $x$ = 2.

The latter immediately implies the unconditional stability of the scheme. Based on the comparison principle we prove the convergence of the scheme to the viscosity solution of obstacle mean curvature flow. Moreover, using the minimizing movements interpretation, we show convergence of a spatially discrete model. Finally, we present numerical experiments for a physical model that inspired this work."

Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of deep neural networks (DNNs) across several domains has led to increasing concerns regarding intellectual property (IP) protection and model misuse. Trained DNNs represent valuable assets, often developed through significant investments. However, the ease with which models can be copied, redistributed, or repurposed highlights the urgent need for effective mechanisms to assert and verify model ownership. In this work, we propose an efficient and resilient white-box watermarking framework that embeds ownership information into the internal parameters of a DNN using chaotic sequences. The watermark is generated using a logistic map, a well-known chaotic function, producing a sequence that is sensitive to its initialization parameters. This sequence is injected into the weights of a chosen intermediate layer without requiring structural modifications to the model or degradation in predictive performance. To validate ownership, we introduce a verification process based on a genetic algorithm that recovers the original chaotic parameters by optimizing the similarity between the extracted and regenerated sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results show that the embedded watermark remains detectable after fine-tuning, with negligible loss in model accuracy. In addition to numerical recovery of the watermark, we perform visual analyses using weight density plots and construct activation-based classifiers to distinguish between original, watermarked, and tampered models. Overall, the proposed method offers a flexible and scalable solution for embedding and verifying model ownership in white-box settings well-suited for real-world scenarios where IP protection is critical."

    "abstract": "Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of \"agreement/execution\" versus \"refusal/safety\" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency."

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI."

These bounds extend previous work on error bounds in the total variation distance, and are the first step towards a generalization to continuous-time Markov processes with continuous state spaces. A Wasserstein matrix norm is used to bound the error caused by the lower-dimensional approximation of the dynamics. In order to control the propagation of the accumulated error, we rely on the concept of coarse Ricci curvature of a Markov chain. The practical applicability of the presented bounds depends strongly on the curvature of the chain. Examples for CTMCs taken from the literature (where we added a metric on the state space) show that a negative curvature results in exponentially exploding bounds. On the other hand, certain CTMCs which we call translation-invariant always have non-negative curvature. When measuring the error in the total variation distance (a special case of the Wasserstein distance with the discrete metric), the curvature is also always non-negative. If it is strictly positive, the bounds presented in this paper are an improvement over previous work."

Their implementation, however, suffered a significant drawback: GCs were approximated from models based on discrete-time stroboscopic sampling of local VOU processes, which is not only computationally inefficient, but more seriously, unfeasible on regions of phase space where local dynamics are unstable, leaving \"holes\" in the GC maps. We solve these problems by deriving an analytical expression for GC rates associated with a VOU process which, under quite general conditions, yields a meaningful solution even in the unstable case. Applied to GC maps, this not only \"fills in the holes\", but also furnishes a computationally efficient method of calculation devolving to solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations which, in the case of a univariate source, become simple quadratic equations. We show, furthermore, that the GC rate for VOU processes is invariant under rescaling of the overall fluctuations intensity, so that GC maps may effectively be calculated for deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems, with a residual \"ghost of noise\" represented by a variance-covariance map."

By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions."

A light state resembling a many-body condensate with slow motion is linked to the high-temperature phase. This novel state of radiation may coexist with nuclear or quark matter in a neutron star's core, increasing its compactness and influencing its stability."

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."

    "abstract": "In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ θ= 60^\\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \\le B_0/b_{rms} \\le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\\widetilde{T_θ}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\\widetilde{T_θ}$ changes sign around 60$^\\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics."

Here we develop the curvature Atlas into a classification tool for integrable and near-integrable rigid-body regimes. We show that all classical integrable heavy-top cases (Euler, Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) correspond to specific degenerate curvature signatures of Kgeo. In each case the inertia tensor imposes a simple algebraic structure on the inertial curvature field: vanishing of one component, symmetric curvature pairs, or orthogonal curvature splitting. We formulate and prove a curvature classification theorem describing these signatures and their relation to integrability. We then single out the mixed anisotropic ratio 2:2:1 as a minimally nondegenerate curvature-balanced regime: it destroys algebraic integrability while preserving an exact curvature balance, giving rise to pure precession for the heavy top. Finally, we introduce a curvature deviation functional measuring the distance to the nearest integrable curvature signature, describe near-integrable regimes in a neighbourhood of 2:2:1, and present an integrability map."

Here we describe an analogous electron-hydrodynamic instability that produces similar running waves in Dirac materials such as graphene mono- and multilayers. It arises when carrier kinetics near charge neutrality make current dissipation strongly density-dependent. As the flow velocity $u$ exceeds a critical value, the system transitions to a state with coupled spatial and temporal oscillations. Experimentally, the instability should manifest as (i) a nonanalytic behavior characteristic of a second-order transition--an abrupt increase in time-averaged current--and (ii) narrow-band emission at the characteristic ``washboard'' frequency $f=u/λ$, where $λ$ is the modulation wavelength. This behavior parallels the AC and DC transport of sliding charge-density waves, but here it originates from a distinct, intrinsic mechanism unrelated to disorder. Estimates indicate that the emission frequency $f$, tunable by current, spans a broad range, highlighting Dirac bands as a promising platform for high-frequency electron-fluid dynamics."

Alternative formulations of the vacuum polarization density and their relation is discussed.

In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model."

    "abstract": "Recently, calculations of the ground states of the lightest nuclei have been performed using highly accurate data on realistic internucleon forces. In this paper, these results were used to describe the properties of nuclei with nucleon numbers $A>4$. Taking into account tensor forces leads to the conclusion that the four subsystems in the nucleus with zero nucleon orbital momenta are combined predominantly into the $^1S_0$ cluster. Subsystems with nonzero orbital momenta also combine into clusters with lower potential energy. This approach allows us to consistently explain the lifetime of the $^8$Be nucleus, the Hoyle state, the sequential mechanism of the reaction with the emission of $α$ particles, the shift of the reaction threshold, and more. The assumption of the existence of a one-dimensional effective interaction of nucleons in the nucleus leads to the conclusion that the nucleus contains a \"power center\" and, accordingly, nucleons have orbital angular momenta relative to this \"power center.\" Our approach does not predict the presence of such a \"power center\" in the nucleus."

SPIs that possess local `memory' qubits in addition to the optically coupled `communication' qubit can improve remote entanglement fidelities through brokered entanglement schemes and entanglement purification. In these schemes, it is critical to protect the memory qubit from decoherence during entanglement operations on the communications qubit. Silicon, a platform with mature microelectronic and nanophotonic fabrication, is host to the T centre, an SPI with emission in the telecommunications O-band that directly integrates with silicon nanophotonics. Cavity-coupled T centres are a platform for brokered entanglement distribution in silicon photonic circuits and over long-distance optical fibre links. The T centre's electron and nuclear spin qubits are an intrinsic register of communication and memory qubits respectively, with anisotropic hyperfine coupling. In this work we determine the T centre's hydrogen hyperfine coupling tensor. We also introduce schemes to protect against dephasing or eliminate relaxation of the T centre's hydrogen memory qubit during optical excitation. These results address a key challenge for practical T centre quantum networks."

    "abstract": "With recent advances in terahertz (THz) sources and detection, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which allows to probe nonlinear responses in a two-frequency plane, now reaches the meV regime relevant for quasiparticle excitations in magnetic materials. This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets."

Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents."

We show how the considered modulated system is connected to the Hofstadter model via the Harper equation. By adiabatically varying spatial modulation parameters, we demonstrate controllable quantum transport and verify the topological nature of these effects through Wannier center displacement and bulk invariant calculations. We also propose an experimentally feasible realization of such a system using optically controlled three-level atoms.

To raise concerns about the reliability and safety of such metrics, we propose a method for finding a single adversarial text in the discrete space that is consistently evaluated as high-quality, regardless of the test cases, to identify the vulnerabilities in evaluation metrics. The single hub text found with our method achieved 79.1 COMET% and 67.8 COMET% in the WMT'24 English-to-Japanese (En--Ja) and English-to-German (En--De) translation tasks, respectively, outperforming translations generated individually for each source sentence by using M2M100, a general translation model.

The SCM consists of a student network with $N$ input units and $K$ hidden units trained to reproduce the output of a teacher network with $M$ hidden units. We introduce a reduced set of macroscopic order parameters that yields a unified description valid from the conventional regime $K \\ll N$ to the ultra-wide limit $K \\ge N$. The control parameter $α$, proportional to the ratio of training samples to adjustable weights, serves as an effective measure of dataset size. For small $γ= M/N$, we recover a continuous phase transition at $α_{c} \\approx 2π$ from an unspecialized, permutation-symmetric state to a specialized state in which student units align with the teacher. For finite $γ$, the transition disappears and the generalization error decreases smoothly with dataset size, reaching a low plateau when $γ=1$. In the asymptotic limit $α\\to \\infty$, the error scales as $\\varepsilon_{g} \\propto 1/α$, independent of $γ$ and $K$. The results highlight the central role of network dimensions in SCM learning and provide a framework extendable to other activations and quenched analyses."

During the first week, the larger spherical shell, the S-shell, forms the photosphere. As the shell expands and becomes increasingly transparent, the photosphere moves inward along the mass coordinate, although it grows in size. When the photosphere reaches the long axis of the elongated inner shell, the E-shell begins to contribute to the photosphere, ultimately comprising the entire photosphere. The simple toy model explains the transition of Rph(t) from being concave (decreasing slope) to convex (increasing slope). A single-shell model predicts only concave behavior. The structure of a spherical shell with an inner elongated shell is motivated by the morphologies of several CCSN remnants whose structures have been attributed to multiple pairs of jets in the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The deduced multiple-shell ejecta of SN 2024ggi in this study, and of SN 2023ixf in an earlier study, as well as studies of the polarization of SN 2024ggi, are better compatible with the JJEM than with the neutrino-driven mechanism. Our study supports the growing evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe."

We identify three distinct quartic band types: Mexican-hat-shaped (MHS), purely quartic, and non-MHS quartic bands, and determine the conditions under which each arises. We find that a staggered honeycomb lattice supports all three classes of quartic dispersion, whereas its planar counterpart yields only purely quartic and non-MHS forms.

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference."

To replicate the information set available to forecasters in real time, we construct a new dataset combining daily financial variables with first-release macroeconomic indicators and use nowcasting techniques to address publication lags. Within this real-time environment, we evaluate the predictive accuracy of a broad set of univariate, multivariate, and factor-augmented models, comparing their performance with two industry benchmarks: survey expectations and futures-spot spread models. Results show that although short-run metal price movements remain difficult to predict, medium-term horizons display substantial forecastability. Indicators of manufacturing activity tied to primary metals -- such as new orders and capacity utilization -- significantly improve forecasting accuracy for aluminum and copper, with more moderate gains for zinc and limited improvements for nickel. Futures and survey forecasts generally underperform the real-time econometric models. These findings highlight the value of incorporating timely macroeconomic information into forecasting frameworks for industrial metal markets."

The spectrogram magnitude is computed via the pseudo-inverse mel transform, then converted to the cepstrum by applying DCT. In this domain, the cepstral peak is shifted without having to estimate its position and the modified mel is recomputed by applying IDCT and mel-filterbank. These pitch-shifted mel-spectrogram features can be converted to speech with any compatible vocoder. The proposed method is validated experimentally with objective and subjective metrics on various state-of-the-art neural vocoders as well as in comparison with traditional pitch modification methods."

Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories."

VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness.

Fundamental-frequency averaged dq simulations (50 MW block, short-circuit ratio (SCR) = 1.5, 0.5 p.u. three-phase dip for 150~ms) show zero unserved information-technology (IT) energy (0.00000 MWh vs.0.00208 MWh for a momentary-cessation benchmark), a 0.57 p.u. peak inverter current (vs. 1.02 p.u. for a synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) baseline), a nonzero mean fault-window grid draw of 0.20~p.u. (vs.approx 0 for momentary cessation), and an improved settled point-of-common-coupling (PCC) voltage minimum of 0.79 p.u. after one cycle (vs. 0.66 p.u.). A forced-oscillation case study applies a 1 Hz pulsed load (+/- 0.25 p.u.) and shows that the normal-operation shaping filters the oscillation seen by the grid while the UPS-BESS buffers the pulsing component."

Here, we examine the formation of ultrathin Ti-silicide on Si(100) using a combination of non-destructive in-situ and ex-situ ion scattering techniques capable of resolving composition and structure at the nanoscale. In-situ Time-of-Flight Low-Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-LEIS) indicates intermixing after annealing at 350 °C, with further compositional changes after annealing at 500 °C, including the emergence of a Si terminating layer at the surface. Consecutive ex-situ Time-of-Flight Medium-Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-MEIS) reveals a Ti-rich polycrystalline surface layer and a Si-rich interface layer exhibiting strong ordering along the Si [100] axis. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) images confirm these findings, revealing a $\\approx$1.5 nm thick epitaxial silicide layer at the interface. The presence of an epitaxial interface is particularly promising for minimizing contact resistivity in ultrathin contact layers, where interfacial order can dominate electronic performance. In addition, both ToF-MEIS and HR-TEM unveil significant variations in the thickness of the silicide layer, with a substantial interface roughness but no translation of this roughness to the surface."

Rubin Observatory promises to be the defining survey of the next decade, supplying unprecedented access to the night sky to static science- and time-domain science-focused researchers alike. Maximizing the output of the broad remit of Rubin Observatory science requires a non-trivial survey strategy. For time-domain science, the most promising strategy designed so far is a rolling survey strategy, whereby a subset of the full LSST survey area is observed at higher rate compared with the nominal rate dictated by weather conditions and the observatory's technical constraints. This strategy is now the baseline approach for the LSST as a whole. Focusing on static science (galaxy clustering and weak lensing), we study how these time-domain-optimized rolling strategies affect the depth uniformity at intermediate years of the survey. We characterize the amount of survey area at high risk of being lost in static-science analyses of a baseline rolling LSST dataset due to an insufficient combination of survey contiguity and uniformity. At intermediate data releases, nearly half of the survey could be lost for static science, decreasing the Dark Energy figure of merit by approximately 40\\%. We describe additional metrics focused on key analysis tasks, such as photometric redshifts and galaxy clustering. We propose a new strategy that returns the survey to uniformity at key release years, enabling use of the full survey area and restoring our metrics to the values they would have in a non-rolling cadence without loss of time domain data relative to a rolling survey with the same number of rolling cycles. This work has informed the third round of optimization of the survey strategy, and the new uniform rolling strategies have been incorporated into the baseline strategy."

Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements.

Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems.

This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token."

Here, we analyze administrative records from over 2.7 million Chilean students (2021-2024) to map post-secondary trajectories across the entire education system. Using machine learning, we identify seven distinct student archetypes and introduce the Educational Space, a two-dimensional representation of students based on academic performance and family background. We show that, despite comparable academic abilities, students follow markedly different enrollment patterns, career choices, and cross-regional migration behaviors depending on their socioeconomic origins and position in the educational space. For instance, high-achieving, low-income students tend to remain in regional institutions, while their affluent peers are more geographically mobile. Our approach provides a scalable framework applicable worldwide for using administrative data to uncover structural constraints on educational mobility and inform policies aimed at reducing spatial and social inequality."

TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence."

E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%.

Extracting this information from the analysis of the post-merger waveforms remains challenging due to the high-frequency limitations of current detectors. Future third-generation observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and NEMO, will have the sensitivity required to resolve post-merger signals with high fidelity. In this work, we apply CLAWDIA, our recently developed sparse dictionary learning (SDL) framework, to classify different EOS models using only the post-merger gravitational-wave emission of simulated BNS mergers available in the CoRe database. Our dataset comprises five EOS models representative of a broad range of neutron star properties. The SDL framework is optimised under realistic detection conditions by injecting signals into simulated noise matching the sensitivity curves of ET and NEMO. Our results show that classification is primarily driven by the dominant post-merger frequency, $f_2$, which encodes EOS-dependent information. At a modest signal-to-noise ratio of 5, our method achieves $F_1$ scores of $0.76$ for ET and $0.70$ for NEMO, with performance improving for higher signal-to-noise ratios. The reliability and generalisation capabilities of the model are assessed with additional tests, including the classification of an EOS not included in the training dataset and the analysis of detector-specific biases."

We present a coherent visibility plane direction-dependent imaging, calibration and mosaicing framework. Our simulations and application to real MeerKAT data show that this joint deconvolution and primary beam correction approach, coupled with direction-dependent calibration, allows for deeper mosaics with greater fidelity and increased accuracy of recovered flux densities and spectral indices, especially beyond the half-power beam width. Our best-case mosaic produces precise flux values within a 6% uncertainty and spectral indices within 20\\% throughout the imaged area, and is fully complete out to twice the radii and half the flux density than the image plane equivalent. The application to archival wideband MeerKAT 1283 MHz data produces the deepest high-resolution image of the Shapley Supercluster Core, with a sensitivity of 3.6 $μ$Jy/beam within the primary beam at a 7$^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution, constituting a $\\sim$ 50% increase in dynamic range over the image plane counterpart, and a fluxscale that is consistent within 10% across the entire field of view. The compute time for the direction-dependent visibility plane mosaic was comparable to the sum of the times needed to perform direction-dependent calibration on the individual pointings. Our results suggest that visibility plane mosaicing with its capability for deeper deconvolution could improve the efficiency of deep and wide surveys, particularly for on-the-fly mapping and studies of low surface brightness sources, and could form the basis of future calibration pipelines for SKA-scale instruments."

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components."

The $σ$-$δ$ mixing softens the nuclear symmetry energy and pressure around twice the saturation density, which enables relatively small neutron-star radii and tidal deformabilities while keeping the nuclear EoS sufficiently stiff at high densities to support $2M_{\\odot}$ neutron stars.

    "abstract": "Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains."

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline."

Furthermore, it is found that combining group-based flavor symmetries underlying non-invertible selection rules with CP symmetry naturally leads to a generalized CP transformation. We also demonstrate the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in this framework and discuss its implications for Yukawa textures."

    "abstract": "It's a practical approach using the ground-aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures."

The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem.

Furthermore, we propose preemptive optimization of the reference force given to the LQR that accounts for the performance of the LQR and generates the optimal reference for the closed loop extrusion dynamics and machine constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the improved tracking performance and response time. Experiments on a Fused Filament Fabrication 3D printer showcase a root mean square error improvement of 39.57% compared to tracking the unmodified reference as well as an 83.7% shorter settling time."

    "abstract": "The dipole response of a nuclear system, characterized by its photon strength function (PSF), is a key ingredient of many applications of nuclear structure, ranging from nuclear reactor design and nuclear waste transmutation to astrophysical models of nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. While the majority of those applications require the knowledge of PSF of mid-mass and heavy nuclei, there is now renewed interest in $E1$ strength distributions of light nuclei in the framework of the PANDORA project, which aims at an understanding of the mass distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic radiation (UHECR).UHECR is of extragalactic origin and its interaction along the travel path is dominated by photoabsorption of cosmic background radiation boosted to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) energy region in the center-of-mass system. Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40. Theoretical predictions are compared to available data and to existing predictions from phenomenological and microscopic models. Finally, the impact of using of CI-SM PSF on the predicted propagation of a $^{40}$Ca UHECR source is studied."

    "abstract": "Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost. Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference."

    "abstract": "Channel prediction is a key technology for improving the performance of various functions such as precoding, adaptive modulation, and resource allocation in MIMO-OFDM systems. Especially in high-mobility scenarios with fast time-varying channels, it is crucial for resisting channel aging and ensuring communication quality. However, existing methods suffer from high complexity and the inability to accurately model the temporal variations of channels. To address this issue, this paper proposes CPMamba -- an efficient channel prediction framework based on the selective state space model. The proposed CPMamba architecture extracts features from historical channel state information (CSI) using a specifically designed feature extraction and embedding network and employs stacked residual Mamba modules for temporal modeling. By leveraging an input-dependent selective mechanism to dynamically adjust state transitions, it can effectively capture the long-range dependencies between the CSIs while maintaining a linear computational complexity. Simulation results under the 3GPP standard channel model demonstrate that CPMamba achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy across all scenarios, along with superior generalization and robustness. Compared to existing baseline models, CPMamba reduces the number of parameters by approximately 50 percent while achieving comparable or better performance, thereby significantly lowering the barrier for practical deployment."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of measurements of diurnal variations in the single electron count rate arising from dark photon conversion at the cathode of a gas proportional counter. Three experimental series were conducted, each consisting of 4 runs lasting approximately 60 days per run. One can expect an excess in the single electron count rate above the average level if the polarization vector of dark photons in the region traversed by the Sun forms an angle between 20 and 50 degrees with the Earth's rotational axis. Such an effect was observed in the first series (significance 6 sigma) and the second series (significance 4 sigma). However, in the third series, which employed two identical detectors simultaneously, the effect was not observed on either detector. This result practically excludes the possibility that the effect observed earlier was purely instrumental. The results of the three series may be interpreted as a possible effect arising from the Sun's passage through regions of dark matter characterized by different orientations of the dark photon polarization vector."

In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \\textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \\textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable.

When applied to high time-resolution pulsar search data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), mRAID demonstrates excellent performance in identifying RFI over short timescales, thereby enhancing the efficiency of pulsar and fast radio burst (FRB) searches. Since the computation of the CCM and the eigenvalue decomposition for each time sub-integration and frequency channel are independent, the process is fully parallelisable. As a result, mRAID offers a significant computational advantage over commonly used RFI detection methods."

However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation."

(ii) An SC/cAFM/cAFM$^\\prime$/SC junction, where two cAFM layers with different in-plane order orientations, under an out-of-plane Zeeman exchange field, produces significant diode effect and anomalous phase shifts.

Previous work has mainly considered perturbations on a Minkowski background, and here these results are extended to the case that the background is a general, non-vacuum, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Expressions are obtained for GW damping and the consequent heating of the fluid, and implemented in computer code. The results are applied to astrophysical scenarios: Core collapse supernovae, the post-merger signal from a binary neutron star merger, and matter accreting at a binary black hole merger. It is found that, compared to the Minkowski case, the damping and heating effects increase, in some cases by several orders of magnitude. It is possible for a GW signal to be completely damped, and for the heating to be such that a gamma-ray burst occurs."

Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \\textbf{S}harpness-aware f\\textbf{E}derated gr\\textbf{A}ph \\textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants."

    "abstract": "Empirical Bayes (EB) improves the accuracy of simultaneous inference \"by learning from the experience of others\" (Efron, 2012). Classical EB theory focuses on latent variables that are iid draws from a fitted prior (Efron, 2019). Modern applications, however, feature complex structure, like arrays, spatial processes, or covariates. How can we apply EB ideas to these settings? We propose a generalized approach to empirical Bayes based on the notion of probabilistic symmetry. Our method pairs a simultaneous inference problem-with an unknown prior-to a symmetry assumption on the joint distribution of the latent variables. Each symmetry implies an ergodic decomposition, which we use to derive a corresponding empirical Bayes method. We call this methodBayesian empirical Bayes (BEB). We show how BEB recovers the classical methods of empirical Bayes, which implicitly assume exchangeability. We then use it to extend EB to other probabilistic symmetries: (i) EB matrix recovery for arrays and graphs; (ii) covariate-assisted EB for conditional data; (iii) EB spatial regression under shift invariance. We develop scalable algorithms based on variational inference and neural networks. In simulations, BEB outperforms existing approaches to denoising arrays and spatial data. On real data, we demonstrate BEB by denoising a cancer gene-expression matrix and analyzing spatial air-quality data from New York City."

    "abstract": "We develop a unified multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) framework based on discrete Hermite polynomials (Hermite matrices) for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations (NCDEs), using multispeed rectangular lattice (rD$d$Q$b$) models. For NSEs, the proposed MRT-LB model simulates incompressible and compressible isothermal flows in both single-phase and multiphase systems. Macroscopic moment equations are derived from the MRT-LB model via the direct Taylor expansion method. By selecting appropriate fundamental moments, the target NSEs and NCDE are recovered from these moment equations. Critically, the elimination of spurious terms and/or the recovery of the desired terms relies on specific auxiliary moments: the second-order auxiliary moment ($\\mathbf{M}_{2G}$) of the source term distribution function (SDF) and the third-order auxiliary moment ($\\mathbf{M}_{30}$) of the equilibrium distribution function (EDF) for NSEs, as well as the first-order auxiliary moment ($\\mathbf{M}_{1G}$) of the SDF and the second-order auxiliary moment ($\\mathbf{M}_{20}$) of the EDF for NCDE. Furthermore, using the weighted orthogonality of Hermite matrices, we establish essential relations for weight coefficients and construct several multispeed rectangular lattice models, including rD2Q25 and rD3Q53, with subgroup models rD2Q21, rD2Q17, rD2Q13, rD3Q45, and rD3Q33. A generalized third-order equilibrium distribution function is derived. We emphasize that for rectangular lattices, specific elements of the Hermite matrix corresponding to third-order discrete Hermite polynomials require correction to satisfy weighted orthogonality."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools in science, technology, and society, enabling transformative advances across diverse fields. However, errors or outdated information within these models can undermine their accuracy and restrict their safe deployment. Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications."

This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression."

The scheme enhances communication security by maximizing the secrecy capacity and the detection error probability (DEP). Under a worst-case scenario for covert communications, we consider that the eavesdropper can optimally adjust the detection threshold to minimize the DEP. Accordingly, we derive closedform expressions for both average minimum DEP (AMDEP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC). To balance AMDEP and ASC, we propose a new performance metric and design an algorithm based on generative diffusion models (GDM) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The algorithm maximizes data rates under user mobility while ensuring high AMDEP and ASC by optimizing power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and superior performance compared to conventional deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods, thereby validating its effectiveness in balancing security and capacity performance."

An alternative mechanism, termed pair-breaking scattering interference (PBSI), was proposed to produce gap modulations without finite-momentum pairing. Here we investigate signatures of PBSI in bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy with superconductive tips, enabling enhanced energy resolution and Josephson tunneling. Subsurface magnetic scatterers with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states are identified in FeSe, around which we observe particle-hole symmetric gap modulations accompanied by spatial modulation of the Josephson current. Those modulations have wavevectors consistent with intra-pocket PBSI. We further demonstrate that phase-referenced quasiparticle interference imaging offers an independent and direct probe of PBSI beyond gap mapping. These results establish PBSI as a viable origin of gap modulations in superconductors lacking preexisting charge/spin density wave orders, and motivate further investigation of the intriguing gap modulation phenomenology."

These discrete ellipsoids are entirely composed of planar quadrilaterals and come in pairs of combinatorially dual polyhedra, which together form princpal binets, a discrete counterpart of curvature line parametrizations. They exhibit a variety of algebraic and geometric properties which are classical in the case of their continuous counterparts. In a special case, it is demonstrated that the diagonals of the quadrilaterals of these discrete ellipsoids form two families of closed planar polygons. These polygons may be regarded as the discrete analogues of the classical circular cross sections of an ellipsoid. As in the continuous case, the discrete circles of any family lie in parallel planes and degenerate at the ``boundary'' of the discrete ellipsoids to ``umbilic vertices'' or ``umbilic edges''. Moreover, in analogy with the continuous theory, discrete ellipsoids admit a one-parameter family of deformations that preserve these discrete circles."

    "abstract": "Throughout history, a prevailing paradigm in mental healthcare has been one in which distressed people may receive treatment with little understanding around how their experience is perceived by their care provider, and in turn, the decisions made by their provider around how treatment will progress. Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability."

Originally introduced by Srinivasa Ramanujan, Ramanujan sums serve as powerful tools for extracting periodic components from signals and form the foundation of Ramanujan filter banks. We investigate the perfect reconstruction property of these filter banks and analyze their robustness against erasures for discrete-time signals in a finite-dimensional space $\\mathbb C^N$ . The study is further extended to non-uniform Ramanujan filter banks, showcasing their ability to address the limitations of uniform ones. Employing the reconstruction properties of uniform Ramanujan filter banks, we present an uncertainty principle associated with a tight frame of shifts of Ramanujan sums. This principle establishes representation inequalities in terms of Euler's totient function that provide sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of signals in scenarios where signal information is lost during transmission or corrupted by noise. Finally, we illustrate that utilizing the signal's periodicity information through Ramanujan filter banks significantly improves the efficiency of signal recovery optimization algorithms, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains and more precise reconstruction."

However, the outputs are often unreliable in such critical areas due to the risk of hallucinated outputs from the LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a fact-checking module that operates independently of any LLM, along with a domain-specific summarization model designed to minimize hallucination rates. Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs). We trained the LLM model on the full MIMIC-III dataset. For evaluation of the fact-checking module, we sampled 104 summaries, extracted them into 3,786 propositions, and used these as facts. The fact-checking module achieves a precision of 0.8904, a recall of 0.8234, and an F1-score of 0.8556. Additionally, the LLM summary model achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 0.5797 and a BERTScore of 0.9120 for summary quality."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, Probability theory was dealing with limit theorems where 'limit\" means that time tends to infinity. Questions about finite time dynamics (evolution) were always considered as, although important for practical applications, but untreatable rigorously (mathematically). The same attitude was in the theory of strongly chaotic dynamical systems, which evolve similarly to stochastic processes. However, a natural question on dependence of the process of escape on a position of a \"hole\" in the state (phase) space, which was never asked in mathematical theory of open dynamical systems, opened up a new direction of research, which was dealing with finite time predictions of evolutions of such systems. It turned out, that transport of orbits in the phase space of the \"most strongly chaotic\" dynamical systems has three different stages. In the first stage there is a hierarchy of the first hitting probabilities, that shows which parts of the phase space the orbits of a system, which is an equilibrium state, will be more likely to visit the first. A principal (and the most important for applications) question was how the length of this interval changes with more refinement observations of the positions of the orbits in the phase space. Surprisingly, it turned out that the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, increases (rather to be shrinking), which, at the first sight, seems to be natural. However, this increase of the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, was rather slow (just linear) with respect to the growth of precision (partition of the phase space) of observations. In the present paper it is proved (by totally different technique) that this growth is actually exponential."

This work studies a class of fractional-order complex-valued bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks and proposes a unified analytical and data-driven framework for synchronization and local stability assessment. Using fractional Lyapunov stability theory together with Mittag-Leffler functions, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of the drive-response systems under a linear error-feedback controller. In addition, an explicit conservative time-to-tolerance estimate is obtained via a standard upper bound on the Mittag-Leffler function. Numerical simulations corroborate the theory and demonstrate rapid decay of synchronization errors in both real and imaginary state components. To complement the model-based guarantees, two trajectory-driven Lyapunov proxies are introduced: (i) micro-ensemble FTLE estimation based on the geometric-mean growth of small perturbations, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) prediction-error index that quantifies local instability through short-term forecast errors. Both proxies reveal oscillatory transient divergence patterns and consistently reflect the stabilizing effect of the designed controller. The proposed integration of fractional calculus, synchronization control, and data-driven Lyapunov diagnostics provides a robust methodology for complex-valued fractional-order neural networks, with potential applications in secure communications and nonlinear signal processing."

    "abstract": "Most of the pulsar science case with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) depends on long-term precision pulsar timing of a large number of pulsars, as well as astrometric measurements of these using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). But before we can time them, or VLBI them, we must first find them. Here, we describe the considerations and strategies one needs to account for when planning an all-sky blind pulsar survey using the SKA. Based on our understanding of the pulsar population, the performance of the now-under-construction SKA elements, and practical constraints such as evading radio frequency interference, we project pulsar survey yields using two complementary methods for a number of illustrative survey designs, combining SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2 in a variety of ways. A composite survey using both Mid and Low is optimal, with Mid Band 2 focused in the plane. We find that, given its much higher effective area and survey speed, the best strategy is to use SKA1-Low to cover as much sky as possible, ideally also overlapping with the areas covered by Mid. In our most realistic scenario, we find that an all-sky blind survey with Phase 1 of the SKA with the AA* array assembly will detect $\\sim10,000$ slow pulsars and $\\sim 800$ millisecond pulsars (MSPs) if SKA1-Mid covers the region within $5°$ of the plane, while higher latitudes will be covered with SKA1-Low. The yield with AA4 is $\\sim 20\\%$ higher. One could increase these numbers by increasing the range covered by SKA1-Mid Bands 1 and 2, at the cost of a considerably longer survey. The pulsar census will enable us to set new constraints on the uncertain physical properties of the entire neutron star population. This will be crucial for addressing major SKA science questions including the dense-matter equation of state, strong-field gravity tests, and gravitational wave astronomy."

    "abstract": "Social media platforms, while enabling global connectivity, have become hubs for the rapid spread of harmful content, including hate speech and fake narratives \\cite{davidson2017automated, shu2017fake}. The Faux-Hate shared task focuses on detecting a specific phenomenon: the generation of hate speech driven by fake narratives, termed Faux-Hate. Participants are challenged to identify such instances in code-mixed Hindi-English social media text. This paper describes our system developed for the shared task, addressing two primary sub-tasks: (a) Binary Faux-Hate detection, involving fake and hate speech classification, and (b) Target and Severity prediction, categorizing the intended target and severity of hateful content. Our approach combines advanced natural language processing techniques with domain-specific pretraining to enhance performance across both tasks. The system achieved competitive results, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-task learning for this complex problem."

    "abstract": "Medical report generation (MRG) aims to automatically derive radiology-style reports from medical images to aid in clinical decision-making. However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured \"thinking report\" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training."

Driven by a topologically pumping dual-frequency waveform, the droplets exhibit alternating active (walking) and dormant (bouncing) phases, producing intermittent azimuthal motion. Tracking individual droplets reveals pseudolaminar chaotic dynamics in the time series of particle's angular position, characterized by laminar plateaus that are interrupted by short irregular bursts of activity. Increasing the driving amplitude induces a qualitative change in the active particle's intermittent dynamics, arising from a symmetry-breaking transition in its Faraday-wave field environment: continuous SO(2)-symmetric \"channelling\" waves give way to discrete \"trapping\" patterns. These findings demonstrate how environmental symmetry and spatiotemporal structure modulate motility and intermittency in synthetic active matter."

In this work, by using the microscopic EP+IPM (exact pairing plus the independent-particle model) for the nuclear level density (NLD) and extended EP+PDM (exact pairing plus phonon damping model) for the $γ$-ray strength function (gSF), we re-evaluate the substantial enhancement of $^{60}$Fe production recently reported in {\\it A. Spyrou et al., Nat. Comm. {\\bf 15}, 9608 (2024)}, which was attributed to an unexpectedly large Maxwellian-averaged cross section (MACS). Our analysis demonstrates that this enhancement indeed originates from the choice of NLD, which, despite being constrained to reproduce the total NLD and gSF data, lacks a reliable spin dependence, a critical input for Hauser-Feshbach calculations of nuclear reaction rate. In contrast, our predictions yield a significantly lower MACS, calling the claimed enhancement into question. In particular, our approach highlights the microscopic nature of the low-energy enhancement of the gSF, the so-called upbend resonance, which arises from strong particle-particle ($pp$) and hole-hole ($hh$) excitations that emerge only at finite temperature, thereby further reinsisting on the invalidity of the Brink-Axel hypothesis in this low-energy region. Overall, our study reopens the question on the long-standing problem of $^{60}$Fe production in massive stars."

Assuming that the centred martingale approximation of $S_n$ lies in the domain of attraction of a strictly $α$-stable law with $α\\in(1,2)$, and that the transition operator satisfies a spectral-gap condition, we determine the asymptotic behaviour of $P_x(τ_y>n)$. In particular, we show the existence of a strictly positive $Q^+$-harmonic function $V_α(x,y)$ such that $$n^{1-ρ} L(n)\\, P_x(τ_y>n) \\longrightarrow V_α(x,y),$$ where $L$ is slowly varying and $ρ$ is the positivity parameter of the limiting $α$-stable process.

We investigated the impact of this selection bias on the energy function through simulations and then applied our analysis to the particular case of FRB 20220912A. Our simulations show that, in the sample of bursts observed by the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), assuming a unimodal intrinsic energy distribution, the band selection effect alone is insufficient to produce a bimodal energy distribution; only the bimodal central frequency distribution can achieve this. The bursts' energy of FRB 20220912A that primarily fell within the observing band showed no significant correlation with the central frequency. In contrast, bursts with higher central frequency tend to exhibit narrower bandwidth and longer duration. The distribution of the intrinsic energy can be modeled as a log-normal distribution with a characteristic energy of $8.13 \\times 10^{37}$ erg, and a power-law function with the index of $1.011 \\pm 0.028$. In contrast to the initial energy function reported by \\cite{2023ApJ...955..142Z}, the low-energy peak vanishes, and the high-energy decline becomes steeper, which implies the low-energy peak is an observational effect. The bimodality of the energy distribution seems to originate from the intrinsic radiation mechanism."

Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

Specifically, the estimation is performed first on a user group basis and then at the individual user level with reduced complexity and latency.We also develop a nonlinear iterative multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm that utilizes a detection window for each user to identify interfering symbols and estimate MUI on a slot-by-slot basis, followed by maximum \\textit{a-posteriori} probability detection of user signals.Simulations demonstrate that our scheme achieves bit error rates comparable to scenarios with transmission delays known and signal detection perfectly synchronized."

Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation."

The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision.

    "abstract": "In this article, we initiate the study of the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional relativistic Euler equations in a low-regularity setting. By introducing good variables--a rescaled velocity, logarithmic enthalpy, and an appropriately defined vorticity, we reformulate the equations into a coupled wave-transport system. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions when the initial logarithmic enthalpy $h_0$, rescaled velocity $\\bv_0$, and vorticity $\\bw_0$ satisfy $(h_0, \\bv_0, \\bw_0, \\nabla \\bw_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac32+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times L^8(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. By using Strichartz estimates and semiclassical analysis, a relaxed well-posedness result holds when $(h_0, \\bv_0, \\bw_0, \\nabla \\bw_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac32}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times L^8(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. Both results are valid for the general state function $p(\\varrho)=\\varrho^A$ ($A \\geq 1$). Secondly, in the special case where $p(\\varrho)=\\varrho$, the acoustic metric reduces to the standard flat Minkowski metric. We can establish the well-posedness of solutions when $(h_0, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{w}_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{1+}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. The regularity exponents for the log-enthalpy and rescaled velocity correspond to those in Smith and Tataru \\cite{ST}, while the vorticity regularity corresponds to Bourgain and Li \\cite{BL}. Moreover, if the stiff flow is irrotational, we can prove the local well-posedness for $(h_0, \\mathbf{v}_0) \\in H^{1+}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, and global well-posedness for small initial data $(h_0, \\bv_0) \\in \\dot{B}^{1}_{2,1}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$."

Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients.

    "abstract": "In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training."

Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis.

However, when these exemplars contain sensitive information, reliable privacy-preserving mechanisms are essential to prevent unintended leakage through model outputs. Many privacy-preserving methods are proposed to protect the information leakage in the context, but there are less efforts on how to audit those methods. We introduce ContextLeak, the first framework to empirically measure the worst-case information leakage in ICL. ContextLeak uses canary insertion, embedding uniquely identifiable tokens in exemplars and crafting targeted queries to detect their presence. We apply ContextLeak across a range of private ICL techniques, both heuristic such as prompt-based defenses and those with theoretical guarantees such as Embedding Space Aggregation and Report Noisy Max. We find that ContextLeak tightly correlates with the theoretical privacy budget ($ε$) and reliably detects leakage. Our results further reveal that existing methods often strike poor privacy-utility trade-offs, either leaking sensitive information or severely degrading performance."

Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning."

    "abstract": "Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning."

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves (GWs) are unique messengers as they travel through the Universe without alteration except for gravitational lensing. Their long wavelengths make them susceptible to diffraction by cosmic structures, providing an unprecedented opportunity to map dark matter substructures. Identifying lensed events requires the analysis of thousands to millions of simulated events to reach high statistical significances. This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$σ$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible. Although GW231123 exposes the challenges of claiming the first GW lensing detection, our deep-learning methods have demonstrated to be powerful enough to enable the upcoming discovery of lensed GWs."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training."

    "abstract": "Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning."

However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io"

In this work, we develop an approach based on mixed-integer linear programming for deciding whether and when core-stable committees are guaranteed to exist. In contrast to SAT-based approaches popular in computational social choice, our method can produce proofs for a specific number of candidates independent of the number of voters. In addition to these computational gains, our program lends itself to a novel duality-based reformulation of the core stability problem, from which we obtain new existence results in special cases. Further, we use our framework to reveal previously unknown relationships between core stability and other desirable properties, such as notions of priceability."

    "abstract": "Can we obtain a Brownian CRT of mass $1/2$ from a CRT of mass $1$ by cutting certain branches? In this paper, we will answer that question in the much more general setting of self-similar Markov trees. Self-similar Markov trees (ssMt) are random decorated trees that encode the genealogy of a system of particles carrying positive labels, and where particles undergo splitting and growth depending on their labels in a self-similar fashion. Introduced and developed in the recent monograph (Bertoin-Curien-Riera, 2024), they provide a broad generalization of Brownian and stable continuum random trees and arise naturally in various models of random geometry such as the Brownian sphere/disk. The law of a ssMt is characterized by its quadruplet $(\\mathrm{a}, σ^2, \\boldsymbolΛ; α)$, which specifies the features of the underlying growth-fragmentation mechanism, together with the initial decoration $x>0$. In this work, we focus on special cases of ssMt in which the trees started from different initial values $x>0$ can be coupled into a continuous, increasing family of nested subtrees. In the case of the Brownian and stable continuum random trees, this yields surprisingly simple novel dynamics corresponding to the scaling limit of the leaf-growth algorithms of Luczak-Winkler and Caraceni-Stauffer."

We identify the trapped agent state as a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically by a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and quantum superconductivity."

    "abstract": "A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models."

    "abstract": "To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning."

To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = κ_{xx,xy} / (T σ_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range."

Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks."

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks."

However, the sensitive nature of data (e.g., eye-tracking) used in these systems raises significant privacy concerns, as adversaries can exploit these data and models to infer and leak personal information through membership inference attacks (MIA) and re-identification (RDA) with a high success rate. Researchers have proposed various techniques to mitigate such privacy attacks, including differential privacy (DP). However, AI XR datasets often contain numerous features, and applying DP uniformly can introduce unnecessary noise to less relevant features, degrade model accuracy, and increase inference time, limiting real-time XR deployment. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework combining explainable AI (XAI) and DP-enabled privacy-preserving mechanisms to defend against privacy attacks. Specifically, we leverage post-hoc explanations to identify the most influential features in AI XR models and selectively apply DP to those features during inference. We evaluate our XAI-guided DP approach on three state-of-the-art AI XR models and three datasets: cybersickness, emotion, and activity classification. Our results show that the proposed method reduces MIA and RDA success rates by up to 43% and 39%, respectively, for cybersickness tasks while preserving model utility with up to 97% accuracy using Transformer models. Furthermore, it improves inference time by up to ~2x compared to traditional DP approaches. To demonstrate practicality, we deploy the XAI-guided DP AI XR models on an HTC VIVE Pro headset and develop a user interface (UI), namely PrivateXR, allowing users to adjust privacy levels (e.g., low, medium, high) while receiving real-time task predictions, protecting user privacy during XR gameplay."

    "abstract": "The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation."

The 2-loop virtual amplitudes are implemented using analytical approximations in different kinematic regions, while all other parts of the calculation are exact. This implementation allows to freely modify all input parameter, such as the three Higgs coupling, the masses of the top quark and the Higgs boson, and the top-quark mass renormalization scheme."

    "abstract": "Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we introduce a process tensor framework that enables the computation of the full numerically exact quantum work statistics of driven open quantum systems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices."

    "abstract": "Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character."

    "abstract": "Topological matter provides natural platforms for robust, non-local information storage, central to quantum error correction. Yet, while the relation between entanglement and topology is well established, little is known about the role of nonstabilizerness (or magic), a pivotal concept in fault-tolerant quantum computation, in topological phases. We introduce the concept of topological magic response, the ability of a state to spread over stabilizer space when perturbed by finite-depth non-Clifford circuits. Unlike a topological invariant or order parameter, this response function probes how a phase reacts to non-Clifford perturbations, revealing the presence of non-local quantum correlations. In Ising-type spin chains, we show that symmetry-broken and paramagnetic phases lack such a response, whereas symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases always display it. To capture this, we utilize a combination of stabilizer Rényi entropies that, in analogy with topological entanglement entropy, isolates non-locally stored information. Using exact analytic computations and matrix product states simulations based on an algorithmic technique we introduce, we show that SPT phases doped with $T$ gates support robust topological magic response, while trivial phases remain featureless."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates two distinct types of block errors - undetected errors (confusions) and erasures - in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with error-bounded block decoders operating in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR."

    "abstract": "The search for sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be significantly advanced through a multi-messenger approach, which seeks to detect the gamma rays that accompany neutrinos as they are produced at their sources. Multi-messenger observations have so far provided the first evidence for a neutrino source, illustrated by the joint detection of the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 in highenergy (HE, E > 1 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma rays in coincidence with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A, identified by IceCube. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), namely FACT, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, continue to conduct extensive neutrino target-of-opportunity follow-up programs. These programs have two components: followup observations of single astrophysical neutrino candidate events (such as IceCube-170922A), and observation of known gamma-ray sources after the identification of a cluster of neutrino events by IceCube. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of follow-up observations of high-energy neutrino events observed by the four IACTs between September 2017 (after the IceCube-170922A event) and January 2021. Our study found no associations between gamma-ray sources and the observed neutrino events. We provide a detailed overview of each neutrino event and its potential counterparts. Furthermore, a joint analysis of all IACT data is included, yielding combined upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux."

    "abstract": "Recently, two unusual features were theoretically predicted for the Raman response of out-of-plane phonons in magnetic two-dimensional materials hosting massive Dirac fermions. First, the phase difference between certain Raman tensor elements was found to be quantized to $\\pm π/2$, sensitive only to the sign of the Dirac fermion mass. Second, a selection rule was identified in the Raman intensity under circularly polarized light, which generalizes the well-known optical valley selection rule. These predictions were based on a low-energy effective model in the continuum approximation. Here, we test the robustness of those results for more realistic theoretical approaches. First, we calculate the Raman tensor for an electronic tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice with broken time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Second, we compute the Raman tensor from density functional theory (DFT) for a monolayer of ferromagnetic 2H-RuCl$_2$. Both calculations corroborate the analytical results found in the continuum model, thereby theoretically confirming the peculiar behaviour of the Raman tensor for two dimensional massive Dirac fermion systems."

    "abstract": "This work investigates structural and computational aspects of list-based graph coloring under interval constraints. Building on the framework of analogous and p-analogous problems, we show that classical List Coloring, $μ$-coloring, and $(γ,μ)$-coloring share strong complexity-preserving correspondences on graph classes closed under pendant-vertex extensions. These equivalences allow hardness and tractability results to transfer directly among the models. Motivated by applications in scheduling and resource allocation with bounded ranges, we introduce the interval-restricted $k$-$(γ,μ)$-coloring model, where each vertex receives an interval of exactly $k$ consecutive admissible colors. We prove that, although $(γ,μ)$-coloring is NP-complete even on several well-structured graph classes, its $k$-restricted version becomes polynomial-time solvable for any fixed $k$. Extending this formulation, we define $k$-$(γ,μ)$-choosability and analyze its expressive power and computational limits. Our results show that the number of admissible list assignments is drastically reduced under interval constraints, yielding a more tractable alternative to classical choosability, even though the general decision problem remains located at high levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Overall, the paper provides a unified view of list-coloring variants through structural reductions, establishes new complexity bounds for interval-based models, and highlights the algorithmic advantages of imposing fixed-size consecutive color ranges."

    "abstract": "Density-functional theory with on-site $U$ and inter-site $V$ Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$+$V$) is a powerful and accurate method for predicting various properties of transition-metal compounds. However, its accuracy depends critically on the values of these Hubbard parameters. Although they can be determined empirically, first-principles methods provide a more consistent and reliable approach; yet, their results can vary, and a comprehensive comparison between methods is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic comparison of two widely used approaches for computing $U$ and $V$, namely linear-response theory (LRT) and the Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism, applied to a representative set of oxides (MnO, NiO, CoO, FeO, BaTiO$_3$, ZnO, and ZrO$_2$). We find that for partially occupied transition-metal $d$ states, these two methods yield consistent $U$ values, but they differ for nearly empty or fully filled $d$ shells. For O-$2p$ states, LRT always predicts large $U$ values ($\\sim$10 eV), whereas the pseudohybrid formalism produces system-dependent values depending on the level of localization and hybridization for the electronic states. Even larger differences are found for the inter-site $V$: the former predicts consistently small values ($<1$ eV), while the latter produces larger values ($\\sim3$ eV), reflecting its explicit dependence on relative charge redistribution. Our results show that while parallels between these two methods exist, they rely on distinct assumptions for determining $U$ and $V$, leading to variations in predictions of material properties."

    "abstract": "An excess emission has been observed by Spitzer in the [3, 5] micron range of the SNR 1987A spectrum. It is generally argued that this excess could be due to the presence of warm amorphous carbon dust in the equatorial ring (ER) around the supernova, but the proposed models all have problems. This prompted us to present an alternative view on the interpretation of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of SNR 1987A from the near-IR wavelengths to the radio frequencies (from 3 micron up to 1.4 GHz), between 6000 and 8000 days after outburst. We argue that the origin of that excess could be attributed instead to a free-free emission. We show that under very specific conditions (the free-free is self-absorbed at a cut-off frequency imposed by the mass of the emitting region), it could be produced by collisional heating of the gas. We then discuss the time evolution of the various components of the SED. We establish a linear relationship between the growth of the warm carbon dust mass and that of the silicates dust during the analyzed period. Finally, we build the Spitzer light curves and we show that our models reproduce the observations pretty well, although our study clearly favors the free-free case. In conclusion, we argue that the free-free model provides a formally very good description of the data, however the model does require some very specific parameter choices, and results in an unusually low temperature for the ionized gas."

    "abstract": "Objective Interaction vertex imaging (IVI) is used for range monitoring in carbon ion radiotherapy, detecting depth differences between Bragg peak positions. Online range monitoring, which provides feedback during beam delivery, is particularly desirable, creating an opportunity to detect range errors before the treatment fraction is completed. Incorporating online range monitoring into clinical workflows may therefore improve the safety and consistency of radiotherapy. Approach The data analysis system was broken into a task-parallel pipeline approach, to allow multiple analysis stages to occur concurrently, beginning during acquisition. Computationally-expensive operations were further parallelized to reduce bottleneck effects. Data collected from irradiation of homogeneous plastic phantoms was replayed at the same rate it was initially acquired, to mimic data acquisition, and the time required to determine a range shift was measured. Main Results With an optimized pipeline, the delay between the end of irradiation and the determination of a range shift is consistently less than 200 ms. The majority of this time is associated with the final range shift determination, with a minor effect from the time required to analyze the last data packet. The most significant contribution to an optimized analysis workflow is the formation of clusters, requiring almost 50% of compute time. Significance This system is the first IVI implementation to achieve clinically-relevant online analysis times. The 200 ms time required to determine a range shift is less than the time required to accelerate a new spill in a synchrotron, and is comparable to the time required for reacceleration if multiple energies are delivered in the same spill. Clinical implementation of online range monitoring would allow treatment to be quickly paused or aborted if significant range errors are detected."

We use it to construct stationary superflows close to the superfluid-normal phase boundary, and examine their stability. We obtain an exact expression for Landau's critical velocity and show that the standard Newtonian profiles (such as the near-vortex condensate depletion or the boundary-layer decay) persist unmodified in the relativistic setting. We further analyse a genuinely relativistic configuration in which an accelerated superfluid develops a phase boundary induced by Tolman temperature gradients."

To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables. The detection system is found to operate at rates up to 1.3 MHz, with a negligible fraction of events being affected by pileup. The efficiency of hit reconstruction is high, with a timestamp resolution of 6.25 ns, and a coincidence window of 31.25 ns, as is required for clinical event rates. With these settings, over 90% of particle interactions are able to reconstruct unique hit positions and contribute to track formation. This device is the first system using large-area, high-resolution detectors which meets the demanding count rate requirements associated with clinical radiotherapy."

These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acousto-optical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straight-forward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback. The system is capable of stable real-time waveform streaming of arrays with up to 50 x 50 tweezers with minimal time resolution of 1.4 ns (700 MS/s) and a peak latency below 257 microseconds for execution of newly requested patterns. Reactive, real-time 2D multibeam laser patterning and scanning with strict intensity matching will substantially benefit parallelization and increasing data rates in materials processing, microscopy, and optical tweezers."

    "abstract": "A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available."

The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving has long relied on modular \"Perception-Decision-Action\" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems."

The core assumption is that mutants behave similarly to real faults, an assumption well established in traditional software systems but largely unverified for DL. This study presents the first empirical comparison of pre-training and post-training mutation approaches in DL with respect to realism. We introduce a statistical framework to quantify their coupling strength and behavioral similarity to real faults using publicly available bugs datasets: CleanML, DeepFD, DeepLocalize, and defect4ML. Mutants are generated using state-of-the-art tools representing both approaches. Results show that pre-training mutants exhibit consistently stronger coupling and higher behavioral similarity to real faults than post-training mutants, indicating greater realism.

Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

    "abstract": "Recent selective state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba and Mamba-2, have demonstrated strong performance in sequence modeling owing to input-dependent selection mechanisms. However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design."

    "abstract": "We present new visible-wavelength spectroscopic observations of the Patroclus-Menoetius binary system in the Jupiter Trojan population. Motivated by previously published spectra from different instruments that showed evidence of significant longitudinal variability, we obtained two spectra spanning 440-680 nm at near-opposite rotational phases with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope during the late 2024 apparition. The same solar analog was used for both observations to remove one source of inconsistency. We measured spectral slopes of 2.51% $\\pm$ 0.05%/100 nm and 8.13% $\\pm$ 0.05%/100 nm at the two different rotational phases. The first of these measurements was serendipitously obtained during an occultation of Menoetius by Patroclus. Although the statistical significance of the spectral slope discrepancy persists even after considering possible systematic errors stemming from differences in slit position angles and air masses between the asteroid and solar analog exposures, we consider this report of variability to be tentative. We briefly explore several scenarios that could explain the measured spectral slope variability. Additional follow-up observations are necessary to definitively confirm and characterize any inhomogeneities across the surface, which will have major implications for the 2033 flyby of Patroclus-Menoetius by the Lucy spacecraft."

    "abstract": "The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales <2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex."

    "abstract": "Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are being developed at a rapid pace, promising closer and closer approximation to ab initio accuracy. This unlocks the possibility to simulate much larger length and time scales. However, benchmarks for these MLIPs are usually limited to ordered, crystalline and bulk materials. Hence, reported performance does not necessarily accurately reflect MLIP performance in real applications such as heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we systematically analyze zero-shot performance of 80 different MLIPs, evaluating tasks typical for heterogeneous catalysis across a range of different data sets, including adsorption and reaction on surfaces of alloyed metals, oxides, and metal-oxide interfacial systems. We demonstrate that current-generation foundational MLIPs can already perform at high accuracy for applications such as predicting vacancy formation energies of perovskite oxides or zero-point energies of supported nanoclusters. However, limitations also exist. We find that many MLIPs catastrophically fail when applied to magnetic materials, and structure relaxation in the MLIP generally increases the energy prediction error compared to single-point evaluation of a previously optimized structure. Comparing low-cost task-specific models to foundational MLIPs, we highlight some core differences between these model approaches and show that -- if considering only accuracy -- these models can compete with the current generation of best-performing MLIPs. Furthermore, we show that no single MLIP universally performs best, requiring users to investigate MLIP suitability for their desired application."

Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \\emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \\emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures. We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \\emph{reflexive competence}, \\emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \\emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \\emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \\emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education."

We conducted deep radio observation and follow-up campaigns with MeerKAT, the Murriyang and the Green Bank telescopes towards 9 X-ray candidate sources. We here report the detection of two new millisecond pulsars, including a black widow candidate, towards the Galactic bulge: PSRs J1740-2805 and J1740-28.

By employing Pauli propagation, it is possible to derive a symbolic representation of observables as analytic functions of a circuit's parameters. Although the number of terms in such functional representations grows rapidly with circuit depth, suitable choices of ansatz and controlled truncations on Pauli weights and frequency components yield accurate yet tractable estimators of the target observables. With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems. This also enables a form of classical pre-training through gradient-based optimization prior to deployment on quantum hardware. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for obtaining the ground state of a spin model, showing that accurate results can be achieved with a scalable and computationally efficient procedure."

However, almost all elements beyond lead, occupying the 6p~to~5f atomic orbitals, lack stable isotopes, hence molecules containing them are referred to as radioactive molecules. Among those, radium monofluoride has seen particular interest, but to date, research on radioactive molecules has mainly been limited to large-scale nuclear facilities. Here, we present a scheme that allows efficient and fast harvest of radioactive ions (including short-lived Ra), and show ion gas-phase reaction studies of singly and doubly charged Ra, Po, and Pb ions with SF$_6$ gas inside an ion trap. Our results show that the chemical reaction rate of Ra$^+$ is in line with trends of other alkaline earth elements, further support by quantum chemical computations. The reaction Ra$^{2+}$ + SF$_6$ $\\rightarrow$ RaF${^+}$ + SF$_5^{+}$ achieves an almost unity conversion efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the application for studies in physics beyond the standard model. The scheme enables future decentralized research avenues with short-lived radioactive molecules for fundamental physics research at laboratories without the need for local nuclear reactors or accelerators."

To quantify deviations from Markovian dynamics, we employ a non-Markovianity measure based on information backflow, allowing a direct comparison between the structured reservoirs and the Markovian limit. Our results reveal clear signatures of memoryless-induced modifications in the transmission spectrum and demonstrate how specific reservoir profiles enhance or suppress non-Markovian effects."

    "abstract": "The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society."

While analog techniques remain prevalent for phase noise characterization of single-frequency lasers, the phase noise characterization of optical frequency combs presents a greater challenge. This complexity arises from different number of phase noise sources affecting an optical frequency comb.

The main contribution of the paper is a detailed nonlinear stability analysis of this family of solutions. For $d \\geq 2$, we consider radial data, while in $d=1$ we allow for general perturbations. After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation."

Next to an electric autonomous vehicle fleet, in the literature, a weighted-sum objective function, which combines the classic routing cost-oriented objective with a user-oriented objective function, has usually been considered. The user-oriented objective function minimizes the total excess user ride time. In this work, we treat them as two separate objective functions, which are optimized concurrently. In order to address the resulting bi-objective E-ADARP, we develop a novel exact framework (called fragment-based checker), whose core part is a smart ``select-and-check\" algorithm that iteratively constructs feasible solutions using fragments. Several enhancements are proposed to enforce the computational efficiency of the proposed method. In the computational experiments, we evaluate several variants of our checker algorithm by leveraging a previously developed branch-and-price algorithm. We benchmark the checker-based framework against state-of-the-art criterion space frameworks as well as a generalized branch-and-price algorithm. Numerical results on both bi-objective DARP and E-ADARP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With our proposed approaches, 21 out of 38 instances are solved optimally, where small-to-medium-sized instances are solved within seconds. On larger-scale instances, especially those requiring high battery end levels are computationally challenging to solve, our approaches provide high-quality approximations of the Pareto frontiers. Efficient solutions with varying energy restrictions are compared and we obtain valuable managerial insights for different kinds of service providers."

The approach generalizes across 4B and 80B models and can also induce targeted refusals when desired.

We combine the two steps and self-consistently extract the nuclear and BSM parameters. We show that the data are consistent with vanishing BSM coupling and extract robust exclusion bounds.

Accessing soliton states is also not trivial due to the thermal effect. Though an auxiliary laser was utilized to compensate for the thermal effect, deterministic single soliton generation is still elusive, especially for broadband operation. In this work, dispersion management is performed for a 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) multi-mode microring resonator, benefiting from the submicron-confinement waveguide layout. The fundamental transverse electric (TE) mode is engineered to anomalous dispersion for two dispersive waves generation over an octave span. While a higher order TE mode is engineered to normal dispersion to accommodate the auxiliary light for thermal compensation. The normal dispersion prevents modulation-instability Kerr comb generation, allowing for a large soliton existence range. We achieve microring resonators with Q up to 5.8 million and sub-milli-watt-threshold Kerr comb generation. Combining the dispersion-managed design and high Q device, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a single soliton comb spanning beyond an octave with a low on-chip power of 60 mW. Our demonstration paves the way to realize chip-scale, turn-key, self-referenced frequency combs."

The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted \"counter\" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines."

Annealing at temperatures around 1100 K produces a sharp emission line, $X_L$, red-shifted by approximately 80 meV from the neutral exciton and exhibiting a linewidth below 200 $μ$eV.

While strong-field-induced Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) has emerged as a powerful tool for probing molecular stereochemistry in momentum-space, reconstructing the original three-dimensional structure of polyatomic molecules remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherent complexity of multidimensional inversion. Here, we introduce a deep learning framework that bridges this gap by directly recovering position-space molecular structures from Coulomb explosion momentum patterns. Our approach combines CEI simulations with a neural network trained to establish the mapping between momentum-space Newton plots and real-space geometries. The trained model demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing the structure of CHF$_3$ from experimental CEI data. This generalizable framework can not only be extended to other molecular systems but also opens avenues for time-resolved structural analysis of molecular dynamics."

Using a combination of analytic arguments and N-body simulations including equilibrium tides and general relativistic precession, we find the boundary in parameter space where an inner companion can remain dynamically stable. We find that survival requires a periastron separation exceeding roughly 14 mutual Hill radii at closest approach. Below this threshold, secular eccentricity exchange, orbit crossing, and/or tidal evolution can lead to the destruction of the inner planet. We apply our methodology to the current exoplanet sample and find that none of the known systems containing a short-period giant and an inner companion could have assembled via high-eccentricity tidal migration. However, warm Jupiters with larger periastron distances ($q_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim 0.05-0.08$ AU, corresponding to final observed semi-major axis values $a_{\\mathrm{out}} \\sim 0.10-0.16$ AU) can allow the survival of short-period inner planets while potentially also circularizing on $\\lesssim 1$ Gyr timescales.

The coils have many disparate engineering requirements from structural to power electronics, as well strict limits placed on the system by the high temperature superconducting (HTS) cables. Simultaneously, the coils must be able to contain multiple plasma scenarios from inception, through ramp up, to flat top, and ramp down, all whilst applying a large, controlled, inductive voltage to drive current. In addition, we wish to optimize divertor separatrices to increase the likelihood of designing a suitable divertor strikepoint. Lastly, the physical limits of the entire tokamak must be taken into account and space reserved for support structures, access for maintenance schemes, and installation limits. The method outlined here uses a combined simulated annealing method to find optimal coil sizes and positions with a constrained quadratic or quartic optimization for the coil currents. The method is designed to optimize coils for multiple scenarios simultaneously, including ramp-ups, to avoid over optimization of a single design point. A key enabler is the efficient implementation that allows millions of evaluations to be performed in a few hours with modest computational power. This optimization method is part of a larger, iterative workflow which enables further, detailed design work to feedback on the optimization."

A subset - non-isolated CGs - are embedded within major structures. Using multi-band S-PLUS data, we analyse galaxies in 122 non-isolated CGs within more massive systems such as larger groups and clusters. We compare them to galaxies in the host structures, hereafter surrounding group galaxies. Structural parameters were obtained with MorphoPLUS, a pipeline for multi-wavelength Sérsic profile fitting. Dividing galaxies into early (ETG), transition, or late types (LTG), we find: (1) Non-isolated CGs host higher quenched fractions and more ETGs, especially for stellar masses $\\log(M/M_\\odot) > 10.2$, than surrounding groups. (2) Sérsic indices increase with wavelength for all morphological types in both environments, whereas effective radii show a stronger morphology-dependent behaviour - ETGs become more compact towards redder bands, while LTGs exhibit flatter $Re(λ)$ trends. Environmental differences remain weak, with only a modest enhancement of the gradients for ETGs in non-isolated CGs. (3) Transition galaxies in CGs show a concentrated $R_e$-$n$ distribution and faint-end bimodality, consistent with ongoing morphological transformation absent in surrounding groups. (4) Phase-space analysis indicates that some CGs in clusters are projection artefacts, while others are genuine dense systems at various infall stages, from recent arrivals to ancient remnants. These results show that galaxies in non-isolated CGs follow distinct evolutionary paths compared to their surrounding groups galaxies, suggesting that the compact configuration plays a unique role beyond the influence of the larger-scale environment."

Both methods feature an upwind flux and can handle Manning's and Chezy's friction law. By numerical experiment we demonstrate the discontinuous Galerkin method to be fully second-order accurate for the Barenblatt analytical solution on an inclined plane. In constrast, the finite volume method is only first-order accurate. Further numerical experiments show that three to four mesh refinements are needed for the finite volume method to match the solution of the discontinuous Galerkin method."

We classify the cosmic web into voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters, and find that massive neutrinos affect the environment by decreasing the volume occupied by clusters and voids. We find that increasing the neutrino mass shifts the volume-weighted density distribution towards higher densities and leads to a more narrow density distribution, which we interpret as neutrinos delaying structure formation. We construct the minimum spanning tree (MST) graph from the subhaloes, adopting a number density chosen to match that expected for DESI-like observations. We show that most MST edges lie in filaments, approximately 70% throughout different simulations, which we link to its sensitivity to neutrino mass. We also link the MST's edge length signal at different scales to different cosmic web environments, with clusters dominating the signal at small scales, voids at longer scales, and filaments at intermediate scales. The strong correlation between MST edges and cosmic web environments reinforces the MST's potential to be used as a classifier for large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. We compare the effects of baryonic physics and massive neutrinos and find that each produces distinct signatures in MST edge lengths. This analysis is performed in 3D space, using the true positions of subhaloes and not accounting for redshift space distortions. Nevertheless, these results emphasise the MST's capability to go beyond two-point statistics, motivating future applications to real observational data."

Among the emerging candidates, $^{44}$Sc has attracted significant interest due to its favourable physical properties, including a half-life of $\\sim$4 hours, a pure $β^{+}$ emission profile, and the additional prompt $γ$-emission that enables advanced triple-photon detection schemes. These characteristics make $^{44}$Sc particularly promising for highresolution imaging and novel quantitative methodologies. However, routine clinical and preclinical implementation requires a practical, sustainable, and cost-efficient production route. In this context, we propose a titanium-scandium radionuclide generator as an optimal solution. This study focuses on optimising the synthesis of the long-lived parent isotope, $^{44}$Ti ($T_{1/2}$ = 59.1 years), from which $^{44}$Sc can be selectively eluted in a chemically pure form when needed. An analysis of various production pathways was conducted, including proton and deuteron reactions on scandium, as well as $α$-particle and lithium-induced reactions on calcium, to determine the most efficient reaction parameters, target design, and expected yield. Furthermore, we identify some existing cyclotron facilities suitable for implementing this technology. Results indicate that efficient $^{44}$Ti production is achievable using proton beams in the 20-30 MeV range under extended irradiation conditions. The proposed generator system would enable routine and decentralised $^{44}$Sc supply. Its integration with the novel J-PET scanner may significantly reduce diagnostic costs and improve access to advanced PET imaging in regions with limited medical imaging infrastructure."

With this generalized relaxation time, the non-linear IS equation simplifies to a first-order non-linear expression connecting bulk viscous pressure and energy density, which remains valid in any homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed. Finally, we solve the coupled EIS equations numerically, and show that the model can support a transient Hubble slow-roll expansion phase with a smooth exit to a radiation-dominated universe, which is challenging to obtain in standard inflationary models."

Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality."

We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices."

SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation.

These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics."

    "abstract": "We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium."

    "abstract": "Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases"

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept by which objects find identity and can communicate with each other in a network. One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step."

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the uniform vanishing damping limit of the 2D inviscid Oldroyd-B model with fractional stress tensor diffusion. Firstly, we find that fractional stress tensor diffusion helps to reduce the global regularity of the 2D Oldroyd-B model with damping coefficient $a\\in[0,1]$. By virtue of improved Fourier splitting method, we then prove the optimal time decay rates under the critical regularity for $a=0$. When $a\\in (0,1]$, we establish time decay rates that are uniform with respect to $a$. Combining the time decay rate for $a\\in [0,1]$ and the time integrability, we obtain the uniform damping vanishing rates for the 2D Oldroyd-B model. Using spectral analysis methods, we finally improve the time decay rates for $\\mathrm{tr}τ$ with $a\\in (0,1]$, which ensure the sharp uniform damping vanishing rates of $\\mathrm{tr}τ$."

One such example is the ubiquitous 2D charge order and concomitant Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped YBCO. Here, using magnetotransport and Hall effect measurements, we find signatures of a Fermi surface reconstruction similar to that in pure YBCO indicating the presence of 2D charge order in Pr-YBCO. Additionally, we find that the phase diagrams of Pr-YBCO and YBCO are decidedly symmetric despite the additional disorder in the former and the distinction between hole depletion through Pr substitution and through O reduction. This indicates that while the mechanism of doping differs, the amount of charge carriers in the planes is the most important factor governing the electronic orders in these systems."

The association rate increases significantly with decreasing flux, a trend that persists also at smaller separations ($R<100$ kpc). A two-dimensional cross-correlation analysis confirms significant clustering of LAEs around SBLAs, while no such clustering is seen for spectral regions with $F>0.25$. The correlation appears to also depend on the width of the spectral window used to identify SBLAs, with a larger window yielding a stronger signal. Our analysis confirms that SBLAs serve as probes of the CGM at the interface between the Ly$α$ forest and the optically-thick Lyman limit systems. The significant dependence of the LAE-SBLA cross-correlation on the spectral binning used to select these absorbers motivates future tests of the current SBLA framework as a tracer of halos."

    "abstract": "Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres."

    "abstract": "Democracy relies on making collective decisions through voting. In addition, voting procedures have further applications, for example in the training of artificial intelligence. An essential criterion for determining the winner of a fair election is that all alternatives are treated equally: this is called neutrality. The established Ranked Pairs voting method cannot simultaneously guarantee neutrality and be computationally tractable for election with ties. River, the recently introduced voting method, shares desirable properties with Ranked Pairs and has further advantages, such as a new property related to resistance against manipulation. Both Ranked Pairs and River use a weighted margin graph to model the election. Ties in the election can lead to edges of equal margin. To order the edges in such a case, a tiebreaking scheme must be employed. Many tiebreaks violate neutrality or other important properties. A tiebreaking scheme that preserves neutrality is Parallel Universe Tiebreaking (PUT). Ranked Pairs with PUT is NP-hard to compute. The main result of this thesis shows that River with PUT can be computed in polynomial worst-case runtime: We can check whether an alternative is a River PUT winner, by running River with a specially constructed ordering of the edges. To construct this ordering, we introduce the semi-River diagram which contains the edges that can appear in any River diagram for some arbitrary tiebreak. On this diagram we can compute the River winners, by applying a variant of Prims algorithm per alternative. Additionally, we give an algorithm improve the previous naive runtime of River from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log n)$, where n is the number of alternatives."

    "abstract": "Effective irrigation and nitrogen fertilization have a significant impact on crop yield. However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development."

We develop a theoretical framework using the photoacoustic wave equation to model acoustic wave generation and propagation in metal substrates, enabling systematic optimization of laser parameters. The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $τ^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \\gtrsim \\sqrt{vτd}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies. This enables rational design of minimal LIAD systems for practical applications."

We prove that for almost all graphs $F$ on a given number of vertices, $i_{K_k}(F)$ attains infinitely many values as $k$ varies. For complete partite graphs $F$ (and, more generally, for symmetrizable families of graphs $F$), we prove that $i_H(F)=i_{K_k}(F)$ where $k=χ(H)$, and is attained by a complete $\\ell$-partite graphon $W_{F,k}$, where $\\ell < k$. We determine the part sizes of $W_{F,k}$ for all $k$, whence determine $i(F)$, whenever $F$ is the Turán graph on $s$ vertices and $r$ parts, for all $s \\le 3r+1$, which was recently proved by Liu, Mubayi, and Reiher for $s=r+1$. As a corollary, this determines the inducibility of all Turán graphs on at most $14$ vertices. Furthermore, since inducibility is invariant under complement, this determines the inducibility of all matchings and, more generally, all graphs with maximum degree $1$, of any size. Similarly, this determines the inducibility of all triangle factors, of any size. For complete partite graphs $F$ with at most one singleton part, we prove that $i_{K_k}(F)$ only attains finitely many values as $k$ varies; in particular, there exists $t=t(F)$ such that $i(F)$ is attained by some complete $t$-partite graphon. This is best possible as it was shown by Liu, Pikhurko, Sharifzadeh, and Staden that this is not necessarily true if there are two singleton parts. Finally, for every $r$, we give a nontrivial sufficient condition for a complete $r$-partite graph $F$ to have the property that $i(F)$ is attained by a complete partite graphon all whose part sizes are distinct."

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24."

    "abstract": "Tailoring the nanomorphology of organic photoactive layers through a specialized chain of processing steps is an imperative challenge on the path towards reliable and performant organic electronic manufacturing. This hurdle generally proves delicate to be overcome, as organic materials can be subject to many different phase transformation phenomena that are able to interfere with each other and produce a wide variety of morphological configurations with distinct structural, mechanical, and optoelectronic properties. A typical combination of such mechanisms, which the present systems are often prone to, and which is complex to investigate experimentally at the nanoscale, is the phase separation resulting from the interplay between amorphous demixing and crystallization. In this work, an in-house Phase-Field modeling framework is employed to simulate and, consequently, explain the phenomenological behavior of a photoactive bulk heterojunction during a thermal annealing treatment. The model predictions are validated against available electron microscopy imaging of the nanostructural evolution during the process. It is demonstrated that the simulations can successfully provide a detailed comprehension of crystal nucleation and growth shaped by amorphous spinodal decomposition, so as to yield valuable insights for physically-based morphology control. In addition, this study shows the relevance of extensive thermodynamic and kinetic characterizations of organic semiconductor mixtures (e.g., phase diagram assessments, surface tension measurements, composition-dependent molecular diffusivity evaluations) for the associated field of research."

TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\\mathbf{n}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems.

    "abstract": "Simulating one-dimensional stellar evolution models with MESA, we show that removing the outer inflated envelope of a mass-accreting evolved stripped-envelope star, like a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, substantially moderates the stellar expansion during accretion at high-mass accretion rates. We study the accretion onto a star via an accretion disk, which launches jets that remove the high-entropy outer layers of the inflated envelope. This is the `jetted mass removal accretion scenario.' By manually removing the entire hydrogen-rich envelope from a red supergiant, we build a hydrogen-deficient WR stellar model with a mass of 6.03Mo and a radius of 0.67Ro. We then accrete mass onto it at a high rate. We mimic the real process of simultaneous mass addition near the equatorial plane and jet-induced mass removal from the outer envelope by dividing the accretion period into hundreds of pulses: in the first half of each pulse, we add mass, and in the second, we remove a fraction of this mass. The removal of tens of percent from the added mass decreases the stellar expansion by a factor of about 2-5. Our results show that WR stars can maintain a deep potential well and not expand much while accreting mass at high rates. This allows the formation of an accretion disk and the liberation of large amounts of gravitational energy. Our results strengthen models of intermediate-luminosity optical transients, such as luminous red novae, in which a non-degenerate star accretes at high rates and launches jets that power the transient event."

    "abstract": "International remittances represent a vital source of disaster adaptation finance for households around the world, yet their responsiveness to environmental disasters remains poorly quantified. We reveal a previously unmeasured global macro-financial system of international migrant diasporas remittances response to the occurrence of disasters in the country of origin. We do so by developing a structural model simulating individual remittance decisions, calibrated with global disaster records and bilateral monthly remittances flow data from the period 2010-2019. Our analysis reveals that approximately 332 billion USD (5.46\\% of total remittances) were mobilized specifically in response to earthquakes, floods, storms, and droughts over the decade. Earthquakes triggered the largest remittance responses per person affected, while droughts elicited the smallest. The model also identifies significant variation in diaspora groups' capacity to activate financial support. These findings establish remittances as a substantial yet limited form of disaster finance, highlighting their importance and limitations in building resilience against future environmental shocks."

With the RPKI, owners of Internet resources can make cryptographically backed claims, for example about the legitimate origin of their IP space. Thousands of networks use this information to detect malicious or accidental route hijacks. The RPKI consists out of 100 distributed repositories. However, public reports claim that some of these repositories are unreliable. A current Internet-Draft suggests best practices on how to operate these repositories, with the goal to improve deployment quality. Inspired by this draft, we take a first look at the operational practices of repositories of the RPKI. We mainly focus on the distribution of RPKI information. We find that there is a wide variety in deployment practices, of which some might risk the availability of parts of the information in the RPKI. This study creates a baseline for measuring the maturity of RPKI repositories in the future."

While fixed target sizes suffice in static setups, in mobile settings, frequent posture changes alter viewing distances, which in turn distort perceived size and hinder dwell performance. We address this through GAUI, a Gaze-based Adaptive User Interface that dynamically resizes targets to maximise performance at the given viewing distance. In a two-phased study (N=24), GAUI leveraged the strengths of its distance-responsive design, outperforming the large UI static baseline in task time, and being less error-prone than the small UI static baseline. It was rated the most preferred interface overall. Participants reflected on using GAUI in six different postures. We discuss how their experience is impacted by posture, and propose guidelines for designing context-aware adaptive UIs for dwell interfaces on handheld mobile devices that maximise performance."

We present a study of CIII] emission in galaxies at z=5-7, using publicly available JWST/NIRSpec prism data from programs including CEERS, JADES, RUBIES and CAPERS. We built a sample of 61 CIII]-emitting galaxies, and we classified them as star-forming or active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies using (1) rest-frame UV and optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams, and (2) the presence/absence of broad Balmer emission lines. The UV diagnostics are based on the combination of the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of CIII] versus CIII]/HeII $λ$1640, and the EW of CIV versus CIV/HeII $λ$1640. For optical diagnostics, we employ the OHNO diagram, which combines [OIII] $λ$5007, H$β$, [NeIII] $λ$3869, and [OII] $λλ$3727,3729- and we find it has a low efficiency on separating AGN from SFG. We find that half of the sources in our sample (29 out of 61 galaxies) exhibit at least one secure indication of AGN activity while 13 are potential AGNs based on the CIII] diagnostic. Physical properties, including stellar mass and star formation rate, are derived through spectral energy distribution modeling with Bagpipes. Our analysis reveals that JWST is uncovering a population of strong CIII] emitters at high redshift (5<z<7) with a median EW of 22.8 A. This EW is higher than that of a control sample of CIII] emitters at redshift 3<z<4 with a median EW of 4.7 A. We find that for the same range of Muv, the CIII] EW increases by $\\sim$0.67 dex from 3<z<4 to 5<z<7, indicating strong redshift evolution in the line's strength.

    "abstract": "Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity."

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods."

While behavioral fingerprinting based on network traffic analysis has shown promise, most existing approaches rely on machine learning (ML) techniques applied to fine-grained features of short-lived traffic units (packets and/or flows). These methods tend to be computationally expensive, sensitive to traffic measurement errors, and often produce opaque inferences. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic, lightweight, and explainable alternative to behavioral fingerprinting focusing on the network services (e.g., TCP/80, UDP/53) that IoT devices use to perform their intended functions over extended periods. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We demonstrate that IoT devices exhibit stable and distinguishable patterns in their use of network services over a period of time. We formalize the notion of service-level fingerprints and derive a generalized method to represent network behaviors using a configurable granularity parameter. (2) We develop a procedure to extract service-level fingerprints, apply it to traffic from 13 consumer IoT device types in a lab testbed, and evaluate the resulting representations in terms of their convergence and recurrence properties. (3) We validate the efficacy of service-level fingerprints for device identification in closed-set and open-set scenarios. Our findings are based on a large dataset comprising about 10 million IPFIX flow records collected over a 1.5-year period."

Here we present the Pretrained Battery Transformer (PBT), the first FM for battery life prediction, developed through domain-knowledge-encoded mixture-of-expert layers. Validated on the largest public battery life database, PBT learns transferable representations from 13 lithium-ion battery (LIB) datasets, outperforming existing models by an average of 19.8%. With transfer learning, PBT achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets encompassing various operating conditions, formation protocols, and chemistries of LIBs.

Glitches cause biased and less precise inference for short-duration signals such as massive black hole binaries, but their effect on long-lived sources such as EMRIs has not been quantified. Using simulated LISA observations containing injected EMRIs and streams of shapelet-based glitches drawn from the LISA Pathfinder catalog, we estimate the glitch-induced parameter biases and uncertainties through a Fisher-matrix-based analysis whose accuracy we verify with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo. We find that moderately mitigated glitch streams i.e. ones containing only glitches of up to moderate SNRs ($ρ\\lesssim 90$) induce negligible to minor biases $[\\sim0.04σ,\\sim0.6σ]$ in the inferred EMRI parameters. In contrast, weakly mitigated glitch streams containing higher-SNR events ($ρ\\lesssim 400$) can produce biases nearing $1σ$. These results demonstrate that, when compared to inference of other sources such as massive black hole binaries, EMRI inference is notably more robust to glitches. We stress that at least some amount of glitch modeling and mitigation remains essential for unbiased EMRI analyses in the LISA era."

    "abstract": "Recursion is a fundamental concept in the design of filters and audio systems. In particular, artificial reverberation systems that use delay networks depend on recursive paths to control both echo density and the decay rate of modal components. The differentiable digital signal processing framework has shown promise in automatically tuning both recursive and non-recursive elements given a target room impulse response. This is done by applying gradient descent to loss functions based on energy-decay or spectrogram differences. However, these representations are highly sensitive to background noise, which is ubiquitous in real measurements, producing spurious loss minima and leading to incorrect attenuation. This paper addresses the problem of tuning recursive attenuation filters of a feedback delay network when targets are noisy. We examine the loss landscape associated with different optimization objectives and propose a method that ensures correct minima under low signal-to-noise conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through statistical analysis on 80 individual optimization examples. The results reveal that explicitly modeling the noise restores correct minima. Furthermore, we identify the sensitivity of attenuation filter parameters tuning to perturbations in frequency-independent parameters. These findings provide practical guidelines for more robust and reproducible gradient-based optimization of feedback delay networks."

Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions."

ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

    "abstract": "The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\\,{\\rm M_\\odot} \\leq M \\leq50\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, we find $0.008\\leq e_{\\mathrm{min},10}\\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if ~1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin."

    "abstract": "For non-motile microorganisms, spatial expansion in quiescent fluids is presumed to be limited by diffusion. We report that microbial colonies can explosively circumvent this constraint through a self-amplifying physical process. As non-motile yeast and bacteria metabolize dense nutrients into lighter waste within their fluid environment, they generate buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-Bénard convection, an ubiquitous fluid-dynamical phenomenon that organizes material on scales from chemical reactors to planetary atmospheres. This robust, self-generated flow fragments and disperses cellular aggregates, which seed new growth sites, enhancing total metabolic activity and further strengthening the convective flow in an autocatalytic cycle. The resulting expansion follows accelerating power-law kinetics, quantitatively captured by a physical theory linking metabolic flux to flow velocity, and produces fractal patterns through a flow-focusing instability we term Circulation-Driven Aggregation, the hydrodynamic analogue of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. This `metabolic fireworks' mechanism establishes a canonical instance of proliferating active matter, where cellular metabolic activity self-organizes a physical transport engine--a living Rayleigh-Bénard convection--providing a fundamental, physics-based dispersal strategy."

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of OpenAI's GPT models, specifically examining the differences between reasoning and non-reasoning architectures for translating between Finnish and four low-resource Uralic languages: Komi-Zyrian, Moksha, Erzya, and Udmurt. Using a parallel corpus of literary texts, we evaluate model willingness to attempt translation through refusal rate analysis across different model architectures. Our findings reveal significant performance variations between reasoning and non-reasoning models, with reasoning models showing 16 percentage points lower refusal rates. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working with Uralic languages and contribute to the broader understanding of reasoning model capabilities for endangered language preservation."

    "abstract": "Mixture regression models are powerful tools for capturing heterogeneous covariate-response relationships, yet classical finite mixtures and Bayesian nonparametric alternatives often suffer from instability or overestimation of clusters when component separability is weak. Recent repulsive priors improve parsimony in density mixtures by discouraging nearby components, but their direct extension to regression is nontrivial since separation must respect the predictive geometry induced by covariates. We propose a repulsive g-prior for regression mixtures that enforces separation in the Mahalanobis metric, penalizing components indistinguishable in the predictive mean space. This construction preserves conjugacy-like updates while introducing geometry-aware interactions, enabling efficient blocked-collapsed Gibbs sampling. Theoretically, we establish tractable normalizing bounds, posterior contraction rates, and shrinkage of tail mass on the number of components. Simulations under correlated and overlapping designs demonstrate improved clustering and prediction relative to independent, Euclidean-repulsive, and sparsity-inducing baselines."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach."

Economic growth theories which treat the accumulation of knowledge and its effect on production endogenously remain relevant, yet they have been evolving to explain how the current wave of advancements in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technology will affect productivity and different occupations. The work contributes to current economic discourse by developing an analytical task-based framework that endogenously integrates knowledge accumulation with frictions that describe technological lock-in and the burden of knowledge generation and validation. The interaction between production (or automation) and growth (or knowledge accumulation) is also described explicitly. To study how automation and AI shape economic outcomes, I rely on high-throughput calculations of the developed model. The effect of the model's structural parameters on key variables such as the production output, wages, and labor shares of output is quantified, and possible intervention strategies are briefly discussed. An important result is that wages and labor shares are not directly linked, instead they can be influenced independently through distinct policy levers."

In this work, we develop an atomistic-based approach for describing primary radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7, by coupling Molecular Dynamics and Binary Collision Approximation simulations in a way that makes them complementary. When integrated with Primary Knock-on Atom spectra obtained from Monte Carlo codes, our results establish a framework for multiscale modeling of radiation damage, enabling quantitative estimates of several damage descriptors, such as defect production, defect clustering, and the effective damaged volume for any specific irradiation conditions where collision cascades dominate. This computational approach is suitable for the prediction of irradiation effects in any complex functional oxide, with applications ranging from aerospace to nuclear fusion and high-energy physics."

In this work, we present Sigma-MoE-Tiny, an MoE language model that achieves the highest sparsity compared to existing open-source models. Sigma-MoE-Tiny employs fine-grained expert segmentation with up to 96 experts per layer, while activating only one expert for each token, resulting in 20B total parameters with just 0.5B activated. The major challenge introduced by such extreme sparsity lies in expert load balancing. We find that the widely-used load balancing loss tends to become ineffective in the lower layers under this setting. To address this issue, we propose a progressive sparsification schedule aiming to balance expert utilization and training stability. Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of load balancing in highly sparse MoE models, offering insights for advancing sparsity in future MoE architectures.

    "abstract": "Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets."

    "abstract": "Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods."

The problem is formulated as a distributed online optimization problem in a multi-agent system. At each time step, each agent only observes its own instantaneous objective function and local inequality constraints; agents make decisions online and cooperate to minimize the sum of the time-varying objectives while satisfying the global coupled constraints. To solve the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the primal-dual approach combined with constraint-tracking. Under appropriate assumptions that the objective and constraint functions are convex, their gradients are uniformly bounded, and the path length of the optimal solution sequence grows sublinearly, we analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation are sublinear with time horizon T. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a time-varying economic dispatch problem in power systems using both synthetic data and Australian Energy Market data. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of tracking performance, constraint satisfaction, and adaptation to time-varying disturbances, thereby providing a practical and theoretically well-supported solution for real-time distributed economic dispatch."

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence."

    "abstract": "We investigate the back-action from a spatially pointlike particle detector on a quantum scalar field, as characterised by the expectation value of the field's stress-energy tensor, without conditioning on a measurement of the detector. First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action. We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory."

In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and $\\rm H_{2}$ fractions more than $1$ dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local ($\\rm 0.3\\,cMpc$) to intermediate scales ($\\rm 1.0\\,cMpc$) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about $55\\%$ of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies when they are selected at $z=3$, although up to $55\\%$ experience rejuvenation episodes.

This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020).

Our results identify a chemically programmable molecular platform for interacting SPT physics in one dimension and suggest concrete spectroscopic routes to organic Haldane spin chains for nanoscale quantum devices."

The Bayesian inference is performed on the quantity $\\log_{10}S^{*}(E)$ rather than on $S^{*}(E)$ itself, which naturally accommodates the wide dynamic range of the data and leads to approximately Gaussian uncertainties. The logarithm of the astrophysical factor is parametrized by a quadratic polynomial in energy, and the posterior distribution of the fit coefficients is determined using a weighted Bayesian regression. From this posterior, a global median $S^{*}(E)$ curve is constructed, and the associated covariance matrix is used to define a low/medium/high (LO/MED/HI) band corresponding to a $68\\%$ credible interval. Particular emphasis is placed on the extrapolation below $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}=2~\\mathrm{MeV}$, where the fusion reaction rate is most relevant for stellar carbon burning. At $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}=1.5~\\mathrm{MeV}$, the posterior distribution yields $S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{*}(1.5~\\mathrm{MeV})= \\left(2.13^{+0.01}_{-0.01}\\right)\\times10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{keV\\,b}, $ corresponding to a $68\\%$ credible interval.

Measurements of magnetic structures of the Milky Way are still sparse in far regions of the Galactic disk and halo. Pulsars are the best probes for the three-dimensional structure of the Galactic magnetic field, primarily owing to their highly polarized short-duration radio pulses, negligible intrinsic Faraday rotation compared to the contribution from the medium in front, and their widespread distribution throughout the Galaxy across the thin disk, spiral arms, and extended halo. In this article, we give an overview of Galactic magnetic field investigation using pulsars. The sensitive SKA1 design baseline (AA4) will increase the number of known pulsars by a factor of around three, and the initial staged delivery array (AA*) will probably double the total number of the current pulsar population. Polarization observations of pulsars with the AA* telescopes will give rotation measures along several thousand lines of sight, enabling detailed exploration of the magnetic structure of both the Galactic disk and the Galactic halo."

In this work, we deal with the consensus tracking problem of OMASs suffering these migration-induced adversities, including non-vanishing perturbations in the agent dynamics/state and the repelling antagonistic interactions among agents, over an intermittently disconnected signed digraph. The OMAS is interpreted into a perturbed $M^3D$ system in which unstable subsystems are created when repelling interactions dominate the normal cooperative ones in the OMAS network regardless of its connectivity. To handle the destabilizing effects brought by the repelling interaction as well as the non-vanishing perturbations, we extend the stability theory for $M^3D$ systems and apply it to the OMAS to show that practical consensus tracking can be achieved if the migration-induced switching satisfies the piecewise average dwell time and activation time ratio constraints. Particularly, we indicate that for vanishing perturbations and repelling interactions, asymptotic tracking can be expected under weaker switching constraints."

    "abstract": "We investigate the three-dimensional melting dynamics of an initially spherical particle translating in a warmer liquid using sharp-interface simulations that fully resolve both solid and fluid phases with the Stefan condition. A wide parameter space is explored, spanning initial Reynolds number ($Re_0$), Stefan number ($St$), and Richardson number ($Ri$). In the absence of buoyancy ($Ri= 0$), the interface evolution is governed by canonical wake bifurcations. Four regimes are identified: an axi-symmetric regime ($Re_0<212$) with a rounded front and planar rear; a steady-planar-symmetric regime ($212<Re_0<273$) with an inclined rear plane; a periodic-planar-symmetric regime ($273<Re_0<355$) where vortex shedding emerges in the wake; and a chaotic regime ($Re_0>355$) with fluctuating stagnation points and a more rounded rear. Despite these differences, all regimes exhibit a tendency toward melt-rate homogenisation over time. Besides, we introduce an aspect-ratio-based surface-area formulation that yields a predictive model, accurately capturing volume evolution across regimes. Hydrodynamic loads also reflect the coupling between shape and flow: drag follows rigid-sphere correlations only at moderate $Re_0$; planar rears enhance drag at higher $Re_0$; lift appears only in symmetry-broken regimes and reverses late in time; torque reorients the rear plane toward vertical, consistent with free-body experiments. When buoyancy is included, assisting configurations ($Ri>0$) suppress recirculation and maintain quasi-spherical shapes, whereas opposing or transverse buoyancy ($Ri<0$) destabilises wakes and promotes tilted planar rears. These results provide a unified framework for convection-driven melting across laminar, periodic, and chaotic wakes, with implications for geophysical and industrial processes."

Within this unified chart we derive exact solutions for the complete collapse process, characterize the causal structure, and track horizon formation and evolution. In particular, we identify and analyse a double apparent-horizon phase inside the matter and show that the event horizon stabilizes at the Schwarzschild radius. We further obtain critical parameter relations that govern the dynamics, including a threshold linking initial compactness to immediate horizon formation. The model is geometrically self-consistent within Einstein's equations but exhibits violations of the standard point-wise energy conditions, highlighting known limitations of idealized anisotropic matter models and delineating the boundary where classical descriptions become inadequate. Together, these results provide geometric insights, compact analytic benchmarks and a didactic, coordinate-uniform perspective on collapse and horizon dynamics."

For general linear Lie superalgebras, the Kac--Wakimoto character formula is regarded as a good character formula for a certain class of ``singular'' weights (the so-called Kac--Wakimoto weights). However, the combinatorial factor $\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{atyp}(λ)!}$ makes a direct BGG-type categorification of this formula rather elusive. In this paper we construct, for a certain class of ``generic'' weights, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula of the same flavour as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from taking images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules corresponding to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras via odd reflections. Note that, while the infinite resolution of Kac--Wakimoto simple modules by Kac modules constructed by Brundan--Stroppel~\\cite{brundan2010highestII} does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution, the construction developed here does."

We investigate the anomalous diffusive behavior of VGLWs and analyze it through decomposition into the three fundamental constitutive effects that capture violations of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): the Joseph effect, reflecting long-range increment correlations, the Noah effect, arising from heavy-tailed step-size distributions with infinite variance, and the Moses effect, associated with statistical aging and non-stationarity. Our results show that anomalous diffusion in VGLWs is typically generated by a nontrivial combination of all three effects, rather than being attributable to a single mechanism. Strikingly, we find that within the VGLW framework the Noah exponent $L$, which quantifies the strength of the Noah effect, is unbounded from above, revealing a richer and more extreme landscape of anomalous diffusion than in previously studied Lévy-walk-type models."

This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified.

However, the search for ideal materials has been limited by the inherent trade-off between electrical conductance and optical transmittance. Band engineering offers an effective approach to modulate carrier type and density, enabling concurrent tuning of both conductance and transmittance. In this work, we present a band engineering strategy that enables effective tuning of both infrared transmittance and electrical conductance in topological insulator (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3, bridging the gap and paving the way for applying topological insulators to infrared photoelectric devices. More importantly, with the combination of high carrier mobility and a large optical dielectric constant as suggested by previous report, Sb2Te3 achieves a high electrical conductance (~1000 S/cm) and outstanding infrared transmittance (92.3%) in the wavelength range of 8~13 um, demonstrating strong potential as an infrared transparent conductor. Our findings reveal that concurrent enhancement of both carrier mobility and optical dielectric constant is key to overcoming the conductance-transmittance trade-off.

While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications."

We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722."

    "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) holds immense potential to streamline clinical documentation, such as digitizing handwritten prescriptions and reports, thereby increasing patient throughput and reducing costs in resource-constrained sectors like rural healthcare. However, realizing this utility is currently obstructed by significant technical barriers: strict data privacy constraints, limited computational resources, and severe acoustic domain shifts. We quantify this gap by showing that a robust multilingual model (IndicWav2Vec) degrades to a stark 40.94% Word Error Rate (WER) when deployed on real-world clinical audio (Gram Vaani), rendering it unusable for practical applications. To address these challenges and bring ASR closer to deployment, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation framework. We employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable continual learning from incoming data streams directly on edge devices, ensuring patient data confidentiality. Our strategy yields a 17.1% relative improvement in WER on the target domain. Furthermore, by integrating multi-domain experience replay, we reduce catastrophic forgetting by 47% compared to naive adaptation. These results demonstrate a viable pathway for building reliable, self-improving ASR systems that can operate effectively within the constraints of high-impact real-world environments."

    "abstract": "Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement."

We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks. Our method aligns the captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic region features to detect changes. Experiments on multi-view and two-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements).

We explore *post-hoc watermarking* where an LLM rewrites existing text while applying generation-time watermarking, to protect copyrighted documents, or detect their use in training or RAG via watermark radioactivity. Unlike generation-time approaches, which is constrained by how LLMs are served, this setting offers additional degrees of freedom for both generation and detection. We investigate how allocating compute (through larger rephrasing models, beam search, multi-candidate generation, or entropy filtering at detection) affects the quality-detectability trade-off. Our strategies achieve strong detectability and semantic fidelity on open-ended text such as books. Among our findings, the simple Gumbel-max scheme surprisingly outperforms more recent alternatives under nucleus sampling, and most methods benefit significantly from beam search. However, most approaches struggle when watermarking verifiable text such as code, where we counterintuitively find that smaller models outperform larger ones. This study reveals both the potential and limitations of post-hoc watermarking, laying groundwork for practical applications and future research."

We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed."

This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively."

    "abstract": "Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

    "abstract": "Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design."

While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr of argon gas. Without plasma, the Rydberg-EIT spectra exhibit rf modulation sidebands caused by electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions in the rf drive coil. With the plasma present, the rf modulation sidebands vanish due to screening of the rf drive field from the plasma interior. The lineshapes of the EIT spectra in the plasma reflect the plasma's Holtsmark microfield distribution, allowing us to determine plasma density and collisional line broadening over a range of pressures and rf drive powers. The work is expected to have applications in non-invasive spatio-temporal electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure plasma, plasma sheaths, process plasma and dusty plasma."

In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks."

    "abstract": "We formulate a statistical-mechanical description of a recently introduced random planting model in which plants are represented by growing hard disks. Seedlings of negligible size are introduced at random positions in a field, grow at a prescribed rate, and are harvested upon reaching a fixed maturity diameter. Planting attempts that would lead to an overlap at any time during growth are rejected. Starting from an empty field, this simple dynamical rule drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state in which the mean planting and harvesting rates coincide. We show that the steady state can be mapped onto a nonadditive polydisperse hard-disk fluid and exploit this mapping to develop analytical predictions based on a low-density virial expansion and on scaled particle theory. The resulting description yields an effective adsorption isotherm for the steady-state plant density as a function of the planting rate and compares favorably with numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. At large planting rates, the density approaches the optimal value achieved by desynchronized regular planting, and the data are consistent with an algebraic approach to this limit with an exponent close to 1/3. Beyond density and yield, we show that the spatial organization of the field at high planting rates exhibits clear signatures of the same underlying geometric constraints that characterize optimal desynchronized planting. This connection is revealed through both the conventional radial distribution function and a radius-resolved pair correlation g(z,r) which highlights strong size correlations associated with parent-child seeding events and whose structure can be interpreted as a dynamically broadened precursor of the corresponding ideal mixe--size lattice. Finally, we extend the theory to sigmoidal growth laws and compute the associated virial coefficient."

    "abstract": "In many systems, servers do not turn on instantly; instead, a setup time must pass before a server can begin work. These \"setup times\" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues. Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST."

However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies."

With realistic selection functions applied, ASTRID reproduces observed dual fractions, separations, and host-galaxy properties across redshifts. We predict a substantial population of small-separation (<5 kpc) duals that current surveys fail to capture, indicating that the apparent paucity of sub-kpc systems in COSMOS-Web is driven primarily by selection effects rather than a physical deficit. By following each simulated dual forward in time, we show that dual AGN are robust tracers of MBH mergers: ~30-70% coalesce within $\\lesssim 1$ Gyr, and 20-60% of these mergers produce gravitational-wave signals detectable by LISA. Duals accessible to AXIS and Roman are the progenitors of ~10% of low-redshift LISA events and ~30% of the PTA-band stochastic background. Massive green-valley galaxies with moderate-luminosity AGN, together with massive star-forming hosts containing bright quasars at $z>1$, emerge as the most likely environments for imminent MBH binaries.

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic stability of N$_2$ clathrate hydrates in the sI and sII structures is investigated using density functional theory with several exchange-correlation functionals, explicitly accounting for composition (cage occupancies) and pressure at T = 0 K. Among the tested functionals, revPBE-D3(0) best reproduces experimental lattice parameters and bulk moduli B$_0$ . Energetic analyses confirm the strong impact of large cage double occupancy on sI, whereas the convex-hull results show that sI with single occupancy remains thermodynamically stable up to $\\sim$ 0.8 GPa alongside sII with single occupancy. Increasing pressure then stabilizes sII with double occupancy, consistent with its larger large-cage volume and lower framework strain. These results provide a coherent, first-principles thermodynamic framework for N$_2$ hydrate stability and a baseline for finite-temperature extension."

    "abstract": "In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

The rising class of non-van der Waals (non-vdW) 2D materials derived from non-layered crystals provides a fascinating new platform - greatly expanding the landscape of low-dimensional materials. Current computational models, however, provide limited guidance: existing descriptors are largely tailored to vdW layered systems. Here, we introduce a general framework predicting crystal cleavage and exfoliable 2D subunits directly from bulk structures. At its core is a universal eXfoliation and Cleavage Potential (XCP) enabling large-scale screening of diverse materials at negligible computational cost. Applying this approach, we obtain 37,208 cleavable surfaces and candidate non-vdW 2D materials from which we investigate 2,377 likely exfoliable ones using high-throughput density functional theory. We identify sheets with square and rectangular lattices, semiconducting systems exhibiting an indirect-to-direct band-gap transition upon exfoliation, and first non-vdW 2D metals. Our study thus opens a systematic route to explore and design new 2D materials with unprecedented chemical and structural diversity."

    "abstract": "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for low-lying eigenstates calculation on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity."

    "abstract": "Online Resource Allocation addresses the problem of efficiently allocating limited resources to buyers with incomplete knowledge of future requests. In our setting, buyers arrive sequentially demanding a set of items, each with a value drawn from a known distribution. We study environments where buyers' valuations exhibit complementarities. In such settings, standard item-pricing mechanisms fail to leverage item multiplicities, while existing static bundle-pricing mechanisms rely on problem-specific arguments that do not generalize. We develop a unified technique for online resource allocation with complementarities for three domains: (i) single-minded combinatorial auctions with maximum bundle size $d$, (ii) general single-minded combinatorial auctions, and (iii) a graph-based routing model in which buyers request to route a unit of flow from a source node $s$ to a target node $t$ in a capacitated graph. Our approach yields static and anonymous bundle-pricing mechanisms whose performance improves exponentially with item capacities. For the $d$-single-minded setting with minimum item capacity $B$, we obtain an $O(d^{1/B})$-competitive mechanism, recovering the known $O(d)$ bound for unit capacities ($B=1$) and achieving exponentially better guarantees as capacities grow. For general single-minded combinatorial auctions and the graph-routing model, we obtain $O(m^{1/(B+1)})$-competitive mechanisms, where $m$ is the number of items. We complement these results with information-theoretic lower bounds. We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than $Ω((m/\\ln m)^{1/(B+2)})$ in the general single-minded setting and $Ω((d/\\ln d)^{1/(B+1)})$ in the $d$-single-minded setting. In doing so, we reveal a deep connection to the extremal combinatorics problem of determining the maximum number of qualitatively independent partitions of a ground set."

Real-time motion detection is implemented by imaging the fluorescence photons emitted by the ion onto a knife edge and detecting the transmitted light, a method used so far to cool trapped nanoparticles. The intensity modulation of the fluorescence resulting from the ion motion is used to generate and apply the feedback signal and also to determine the ion temperature. The method benefits from a high rate of detected scattered photons, which can be a challenge, and which we address by using a parabolic mirror for collecting the fluorescence."

The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) concept is designed to probe this gap, enabling continuous observation of compact binaries over months to years prior to coalescence, and detecting sources inaccessible to both space-based mHz detectors and current ground-based >10 Hz facilities. This new GW window fundamentally alters the landscape of time-domain multi-messenger astronomy. Rather than reacting to mergers after the fact, LGWA enables predictive, scheduled electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, transforming how compact-object mergers, their environments, and their astrophysical channels are studied. However, fully exploiting LGWA discoveries requires EM capabilities that do not exist today and are unlikely to be available by the 2030s, particularly for wide-area, rapid, spectroscopically rich follow-up at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This White Paper identifies the key science cases enabled by LGWA that motivate new ground-based capabilities in the 2040s."

    "abstract": "Our group develops a PET/MRI insert for enhanced breast imaging with a 3T clinical whole-body PET/MRI scanner. The small-bore diameter of 175 mm is susceptible to parallax errors, resulting in variable spatial resolution across the field of view. To mitigate this effect, we designed a depth-of-interaction capable PET detector based on a clinical detector platform. The detector employs a 4×4 SiPM array coupled to a stacked crystal block design (crystal pitch 1.6 mm) with ESR reflector. The top and bottom layer consist of 9×9 (length 5.2 mm) and 10×10 (9.8 mm) crystals. Point sources containing Ba-133 (356 keV), Na-22 (511 keV) and Cs-137 (667 keV) were used to obtain floodmaps and energy spectra. Timing performance of the detectors was assessed with a centered Na-22 point source between two aligned detectors facing each other. Furthermore, we centered a point-like volume of F-18 (207.8 MBq) with a distance of 100 mm to each detector to assess stability with respect to count rate by performing measurements at different time points. The detector showed a good crystal identification capability with a peak-to-valley ratio of 3.54 | 3.44 (x | y direction) and an energy resolution of 12.9 | 13.0 % (top | bottom). Comparison of the photopeak positions showed high linearity beyond 511 keV, with R2 values of the corresponding linear fits ≥ 0.997. The block-to-block timing resolution was 310 ps without any correction applied. The performance metrics remained stable for count rates beyond 300 kcps with standard deviations below 0.21 %, 2.5 keV and 13.5 ps for energy resolution, peak position and CTR, respectively. These preliminary evaluations demonstrate the suitability of the clinical detector platform for its use with small crystals in complex configurations for the breast PET/MRI insert. Current work focuses on optimization of operational parameters and implementing corrections to further improve the performance."

    "abstract": "Proton therapy for cancer is believed to offer improved dose precision and sparing of normal tissue due to the dosimetric properties and the Bragg peak. Estimation of accurate proton stopping power ratios (SPR) is a prerequisite for minimizing range uncertainty and treatment margins. Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) can provide more information on the composition of patient tissues, which may improve the SPR and range estimation accuracy. With more than two independent energy measurements, it is possible to decompose a tissue into multiple basis materials and thereby reduce the bias in the tissue model. On the other hand, estimating more independent components from the same data is expected to increase noise. This work aims to investigate the trade-off between bias reduction and noise increase in SPR estimates resulting from higher dimensionalities in material decomposition with PCCT. Using Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, the basis image noise is estimated and propagated to SPR level for 1,2,3, and 4 basis materials. The SPR bias is also evaluated. SPR image volumes corresponding to the calculated statistics are generated for range simulation in RayStation. For the proton energy and test tissue example in this work, the optimal dimensionality for SPR and range is concluded to be 2. The expected accumulation of systematic error and simultaneous averaging of random error in the particle transport suggests that a higher dimensionality may be optimal at greater tissue depths."

In this study, R -value, which is the ratio of high-energy attenuation coefficient to the low-energy attenuation coefficient was used as the physical quantity for the effective atomic number estimation. Based on the dominant photon interactions and their relationships between the effective atomic number, the calibration coefficients for the mathematical model were found. In order to handle the beam hardening effect, a process called thickness binning was conducted. The test of the proposed method was done upon dual-energy xray images acquired using real inspection system. As a result, the proposed method accurately estimated the effective atomic numbers of the objects with arbitrary shapes with small percent differences. The image of the estimated effective atomic number and corresponding pseudocolorized image are given in the paper. We expect the application of the proposed method expands to other various forms of inspection systems."

    "abstract": "During future fuel debris removal at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (1F), the movement of fuel, structural materials, and water will affect the criticality of the melted cores. Inadvertent re-criticality events are undesirable, as they can produce bursts of radiation hazardous to personnel and equipment, and generate additional fission products. To address this, we assess the use of neutron noise measurements to estimate the time-dependent criticality of a subcritical system undergoing reactivity perturbations. Using a water-moderated, UO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> fueled critical assembly, we experimentally demonstrate that certain events-such as flooding-can significantly increase system criticality while simultaneously reducing the neutron count rate at a detector. Neutron noise measurements were conducted with varying numbers of fuel rods during water filling and dumping cycles. Our results highlight the limitations of relying solely on gross neutron count rates to assess criticality, and demonstrate the feasibility of performing neutron noise diagnostics in dynamic, time-varying conditions with changing detector efficiency."

Calibration results demonstrated an energy resolution (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM) of 11.89 % at 662 keV. Imaging experiments with a point source yielded an angular resolution of 8.95° (FWHM) at a scatterer-to-absorber distance of 50 mm. Additionally, successful imaging of a V-shaped tubing phantom confirmed the system's ability to accurately image distributed sources. Future work will focus on optimizing the system design, including studying the effects of temperature and bias on SiPM gain, to enhance the camera's performance for various applications."

Their ability of particle tracking enables analysis of mixed radiation fields useful around accelerators and fusion or fission reactors. These harsh environments require hard materials. The SiC is very perspective semiconductor material providing high radiation hardness and wide temperature operation. The first hybrid pixel detector with SiC sensor, the SiC-Timepix3 detector, was prepared in 2022 [1].

The 4 H-SiC sensor pixelated structure of Schottky electrodes bump-bonded to Timepix3 read-out chip create the depletion regions defining individual detection zones. Their depths increase with reverse biasing of the structure through Timepix3 chip adjusting the active thickness of sensitive epitaxial layer. The capacitance-voltage measurement on single diode detectors from the same 4 H-SiC material have revealed the exact penetration depth of depletion region with applied reverse bias. Half of the layer is depleted with −55 V, for full depletion −220 V is needed. In this paper we examine the detector spectral response to fast neutrons and gamma rays at different detector biasing. The detection efficiency of the 14 MeV neutrons from D-T neutron generator and gamma and X-rays from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{241} \\text{Am}$</tex> with SiC-Timepix3 detector biased to various reverse voltages was in agreement with responsible active thicknesses calculated from capacitance measurements.

    "abstract": "The energy spectrum estimation of an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) source is not only a key indicator for assessing whether the system is operating normally, but also serves as the foundation for further application studies. Spectrum estimation from transmission measurements using the expectation maximization (EM) method has been widely applied for X-ray spectra or Bremsstrahlung spectra. However, for quasi-monochromatic gamma ray spectra of ICS sources, the low rate of change in the attenuation coefficients of materials causes the traditional EM method to converge too slowly, making it ineffective for spectrum reconstruction. We proposed a modified EM method that significantly accelerated the convergence rate. The energy spectra of an ICS gamma ray source were obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical simulations were carried out to test the feasibility of estimating quasi-monochromatic spectra with mean energies of 530 keV (energy spread of 1.1 %) and 2853 keV (energy spread of 1.28 %) under various measurement error conditions. The results demonstrated that the modified EM method can provide better approximations of quasi-monochromatic gamma ray spectra with fewer iterations than the traditional EM method, but the transmission measurement accuracy were required to reach 10-4 and 10-5 respectively."

Accurate measurement of rotational torque plays a crucial role in monitoring efficiency and ensuring optimal performance. This paper presents a novel, non-contact measurement technique based on optical coherent displacement, integrating dual-optical-detector probes for simultaneous rotational torque and speed measurement. A sensing model that links optical coherent signals to change in rotational torque and rotational speed is established. Experiment demonstrates high accuracy of the system, with rotational speed error ranging from 0.25 % to 0.67 %, and rotational torque indication error between 0.03 % and 2.25 %. Furthermore, the experiments proved that the repeatability error is less than 1%, the hysteresis error is less than 1.6%, and the linearity error is in the range of 0.24%~0.57% for rotational torque measurement. The research further evaluates the influence of rotational speed on rotational torque measurement accuracy, revealing minimal impact at higher speeds. The findings suggest that the proposed method offers significant potential for precision measurement in rotating machinery, enabling the simultaneous measurement of both torque and rotational speed. This capability has important implications for improving system efficiency and supporting sustainable industrial practices."

    "abstract": "Series arc fault (SAF) detection is crucial for mitigating electrical fires in building distribution systems and ensuring occupant and property safety. However, existing methods can only detect SAFs in limited or idealized scenarios, often suffering from false alarms and missed detections in more complex real-world systems. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel SAF detection method combining physics-guided feature extraction with an entropy-enhanced weighted decision tree. First, an experimental platform simulating SAFs in building distribution systems is constructed, and the effectiveness of the zero-sequence current coupling signal (ZSCCS) as a detection signal is verified through systematic analysis and comparison. Second, qualitative characteristics of pulses—including positional distribution, amplitude trends, and occurrence frequency—are analyzed, while theoretical correlations between arcing processes and ZSCCS waveform variations are established through RLC-based circuit modeling. Third, four time-frequency domain features are extracted to quantify fault characteristics in ZSCCS, and a detection algorithm is designed based on these features, an entropy-enhanced weighted decision tree, and arc fault decision criteria. Finally, the method’s effectiveness is validated through both offline and online experiments, as well as anti-interference tests. The results show that the proposed method achieves 98.91% detection accuracy (24 960 samples) under complex scenarios involving thirteen loads, four circuit topologies, and two arcgenerating modes, outperforming existing methods. Furthermore, it has been implemented in a self-developed arc fault detection device, demonstrating its potential for engineering applications in building distribution systems."

    "abstract": "Time-of-Flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) has seen substantial advancements over the past decade, largely driven by improvements in detector technology. These next-generation detector designs necessitate adaptations to iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithms in order to fully capitalize on the enhanced information they provide, such as the need for more accurate TOF kernel models. In this work, we investigate the impact of the accuracy of the system matrix model on TOF-PET image reconstruction performance, particularly in the context of systems with fast coincidence time resolution. Monte-Carlo simulations of a Jaszczack digital phantoms were performed to generate datasets with time-of-flight resolution varying from 250 ps to 50ps. TOF-OSEM reconstruction of these datasets were performed using system matrix model of varying accuracy, including Siddon and Joseph projectors, a uniform multi-lines projector, and a multi-lines projector including intra/inter crystal penetration and scattering effects. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the reconstructed images were subsequently conducted. The CRC versus noise trade-off indicates that, although improved timing resolution reduces image noise, it is also associated with a noticeable decline in contrast recovery. However, this degradation is mitigated when employing the most accurate projector models evaluated in this study. Consistent trends were also observed in the qualitative analysis of the rod section and in the resolution recovery measurements These results indicate that integrating more accurate projectors into the system matrix allow to fully leverage the benefits of enhanced timing information in fast TOF PET iterative reconstruction. Future work will investigate the influence of various TOF kernel models and evaluate the reconstruction performance for datasets comprising events with mixed timing resolutions."

    "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a particle reconstruction method using deep learning techniques based on graph neural networks, specifically employing the GravNet architecture and object condensation, for application in future electron-positron collider experiments focused on precision Higgs boson measurements. Traditional pattern recognition methods used in particle flow reconstruction are limited by manual parameter tuning and rigid logic structures, which constrain their ability to handle complex detector responses and to integrate new types of input, such as fine timing information. In this study, we propose a deep learning model that simultaneously performs clustering and energy estimation of particles by learning geometric relationships among detector hits. The network takes as input the position and energy deposition of calorimeter hits and the momentum of charged particle tracks, and maps each hit to a latent point in an abstract coordinate space, enabling hit-level clustering through a learned condensation process. Charged particle tracks are incorporated as fixed reference points to guide the clustering and ensure proper separation of overlapping particle showers. The method is evaluated using simulated data from the International Large Detector concept, including tau lepton decays at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$10 \\sim \\text{GeV}$</tex> and quark jets at the Z boson mass energy. Quantitative comparisons with a widely used conventional method show that the proposed approach yields comparable or improved clustering accuracy for major particle species, particularly for charged pions, which are the dominant component of jets. Energy estimation for charged particles is accurate, whereas neutral particle estimates remain more sensitive to clustering precision. Overall, the method demonstrates the effectiveness of graph-based deep learning in processing high-granularity detector data and motivates further development toward high-resolution jet energy reconstruction in collider environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of high spatial resolution scintillator radiation detectors based on microcapillaries embedded with organic glass scintillators (OGS) for nuclear physics experiments and imaging applications. These detectors offer spatial resolution down to tens of micrometers combined with ultrafast timing response (>2ns) and excellent energy resolution. We demonstrate a novel fabrication technique that achieves uniform and crack-free incorporation of OGS in microcapillaries with diameters as small as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>. Fluorescence imaging confirms effective optical confinement within individual microcapillaries, preserving the high spatial resolution of the capillary structure. Beta particle tracking experiments using 90Sr sources with different collimation configurations validate the detector's ability to resolve spatial details effectively. Additionally, a high spatial resolution Hamamatsu S13552 SiPM array ( <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$230 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> pitch) was employed to simultaneously acquire position, energy, and timing information from OGS sensors, demonstrating its potential for particle tracking in high luminosity nuclear physics experiments. Pulse shape discrimination capabilities with a figure of merit of 2.8 further enhance particle identification. These detectors present significant advantages over current technologies in terms of radiation hardness, timing resolution, and scalability, making them promising candidates for next-generation nuclear physics tracking detectors and beam monitoring applications."

    "abstract": "Low-observable maneuvering targets significantly challenge radar detection due to their low radar cross-section (RCS) and high maneuverability. Within the dechirp-receiving radar system, the conventional dechirp generalized Radon-Fourier transform (DGRFT) method can measure the motion parameters of low-observable maneuvering targets through grid-based matching, which imposes a substantial computational burden. Moreover, this method performs suboptimally when the actual motion parameters deviate significantly from the discrete grid points. To overcome these limitations, this article first introduces a novel frequency-domain formulation, termed fast-frequency DGRFT (FDGRFT), which achieves computational reduction by deriving an efficient frequency-domain filter bank structure for parameter measurement. Furthermore, to address the suboptimal performance of grid-based DGRFT for off-grid parameters and the limitations of prior optimization attempts, a newly developed metaheuristic, the Lévy golden sparrow search algorithm (LGSSA), is proposed and integrated with FDGRFT. This synergistic LGSSA-FDGRFT method enables more accurate and robust measurement of target motion parameters, while further reducing computational complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed detection method for low-observable maneuvering aerial targets is validated through both simulations and measured data."

    "abstract": "The Human Dynamic NeuroChemical Connectome (HDNCC) integrates a dedicated brain PET camera (NeuroSphere) with a 7-T MRI scanner to image dynamic brain processes with high temporal resolution. The 872 LSO+MPPC detector blocks are arranged in a partial sphere with a 32 cm inner diameter, a 25 cm front opening, and a 9 cm rear opening for the RF coil's cable routing. This yields an estimated 70% solid-angle coverage. The spherical gantry consists of 19 parallel rings manufactured using stereolithography 3D printing. Each detector block is pressfitted in position, with a soft silicone cushion protecting the MPPC from vibration. All custom electronics and components employ MR-safe materials and designs that minimize RF noise and ground loops. A dual cooling strategy manages thermal loads. A closed-loop water system, using flexible tubes routed through dedicated channels and encapsulated in thermal silicone on each support ring, maintains the PET modules at a stable temperature (currently set at ~30.5°C). Directed air cooling is used for the readout electronics and power supplies installed behind the PET gantry. 7T MR integration features a custom 16-ch transmit-receive RF coil using a sparse wire layout to reduce photon attenuation. A conforming RF shield, constructed from dielectric Kapton tape sandwiched between conductive Pyralux patches to form a capacitive network, extends to the 3 mm -thick carbon fiber protective enclosure housing the entire PET system. The NeuroSphere's gantry, with all the integrated detectors, readout electronics, and the watercooling system, is now fully assembled. Core PET functionalities are operational. Current efforts are focused on fine-tuning, calibration, and performance characterization. Subsequent steps will involve integrating the carbon fiber shell and conducting the first simultaneous PET/MR imaging tests in phantoms and humans."

    "abstract": "Photon-counting detectors (PCDs) with multiple energy bins have demonstrated significant clinical potential in spectral imaging for medical computed tomography (CT). However, the benefits of PCDs can be compromised by various physical non-idealities, particularly the pulse pileup effect. This effect arises when incident photons arrive in close temporal proximity, especially at clinically relevant high-flux rates, leading to decreased output counting rates, distorted measured spectra, and consequently, degraded image quality. Conventional correction methods employ precise physical detection models, such as the nonparalyzable model, to recover pileup-free counts from pileup-affected counts for individual energy bins; however, these approaches ignore the strong correlations among measured data across different energy bins. In this study, we propose a neural network-based approach to correct the pileup effect on measured counts across multiple energy bins of PCDs. Our method leverages a physics-guided detector model to restore spectral responses unaffected by pileup and to generate training datasets. Promising preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach."

Each position-sensitive detector layer is composed of 48 triangular plastic scintillator strips, and each strip is embedded with two wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers for position readout. By a specially designed encoding module, four fibers are coupled to a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), so that the 96 WLS fibers in a layer are coupled into 24 SiPMs, whose signals are further processed by a front-end electronics module. Therefore, the electronics system for the detector contains eight front-end modules and one coincidence module. One front-end module has 24 independent readout channels, each channel is responsible for digitizing the time and energy information of the detected event. Under the control of the coincidence module, every front-end module transmits the acquired data to the central computer through a network switch. The functions of the electronics system, such as the noise level, the time resolution, and the energy resolution, have been well evaluated. Combined with the detector, the test results show that the cosmic ray test platform achieves a time resolution of 6.5 ns and a position resolution of 1.2 mm, meeting the position requirements of performance evaluation for most detectors."

However, the resolution was limited to around 0.6 mm due to unoptimized crystal pitch and layer design. In this study, following our simulation study presented in IEEE MIC 2024, we developed a new small animal PET scanner to achieve sub- 0.5 mm resolution for mouse brain imaging. The developed small animal PET scanner had a 48 mm inner diameter and 23.4 mm axial FOV. The LYSO crystal array had the pixel pitch of 0.8 mm and total thickness of 11 mm. The PET scanner consisted of 2 rings each of which had 16 DOI detectors. Each DOI detector consisted of a 3-layer staggered LYSO crystal array and 5 × 5 SiPM array with a pixel pitch of 2.4 mm. The SiPM anode signals were multiplexed using a resistive network and then digitized by a custom-made DAQ. The respective measured spatial resolutions at the center and 5 mm radial offset were 0.68 mm and 0.71 mm for the FBP algorithm. The 0.45 mm rod structures of a resolution phantom were resolved using the OSEM algorithm. The in vivo mouse brain imaging showed detailed mouse brain structures, which were barely resolved with conventional preclinical PET scanners. In summary, we successfully developed the new mouse brain PET scanner that can provide sub- 0.5 mm resolution. In the near future, we will use the developed PET for neuroscience research with disease rodent models."

    "abstract": "Characterization via system modeling plays a key role in the design and refinement of spectral computed tomography (CT) systems. Whereas image noise has been effectively modeled using the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) under the unbiased estimator assumption, spectral bias–stemming from hardware/software limitations and quantum noise–continues to be a significant challenge in spectral CT research. To enhance the clinical utility of spectral data, such as the use of iodine as a biomarker, it is essential to minimize bias in clinical imaging protocols. This study introduces a statistical framework for quantifying bias in material decomposition basis domains derived in spectral CT. To demonstrate this method, we utilize a PMMA/iodine phantom to replicate a contrast-enhanced clinical protocol. A realistic x-ray source and two bin photoncounting detector (PCD) is modeled. To estimate the bias, we first generate line projections which deviate ±6 standard deviations from the expected values of each basis function and compute their probability based on the system parameters. The joint likelihood for every pair of biased projections is mapped into the two-dimensional base material space where the expected bias in each material can be measured. By applying the bias metric, system parameters such as bin threshold levels can be optimized to reduce bias either independently or together with noise. Our results highlight the ability to quantify spectral bias and underscore the distinction between bias estimation and the CRLB. Achieving optimal performance in clinical tasks necessitates a trade-off between noise and bias. The proposed bias estimator delivers a robust, quantitative framework for assessing and minimizing bias across various system configurations."

The IC is specifically engineered to meet the stringent performance requirements of large-volume, high-capacitance detectors, such as inverted coaxial point contact (ICPC) high purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors employed in neutrinoless double-beta decay (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0 \\nu \\beta \\beta$</tex>) experiments like LEGEND (Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\beta \\beta$</tex> Decay). The circuit integrates a lownoise charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA), a low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator, and a fully differential output buffer capable of driving analog signals over long transmission lines with minimal distortion or signal degradation. This integration minimizes parasitic elements and enhances signal fidelity while reducing overall system complexity and power consumption. The IC is fabricated using a low power, low-k dielectric, 65 nm CMOS technology well-suited for cryogenic environments. Operated at 80 K, the front-end achieves an equivalent noise charge (ENC) below 100 electrons rms for capacitances as high as 10 pF, satisfying the low noise demands of precision spectroscopy and rare-event detection. Comprehensive characterization of the IC includes detailed measurements of noise spectral density, charge linearity, power efficiency, dynamic range, and long-term stability. Performance metrics are benchmarked against both discrete component-based and other monolithic readout solutions currently in use or under development. The proposed IC offers a compact, scalable, and power-efficient readout solution, paving the way for next-generation germanium-based detector arrays experiments requiring exceptional energy resolution and robust signal integrity."

    "abstract": "In adaptive time-triggered systems, dynamic schedule switching in response to environmental and internal state changes is essential. However, existing approaches relying on offline-generated Multiple Scheduling Graphs (MSGs) often suffer from high memory overhead, whereas online schedule generation incurs adaptation latency. To address both limitations, proactive speculative scheduling with event prediction has emerged as a promising solution. Existing event prediction models rely on single-cycle input, which may lack sufficient temporal context. In this work, we argue that multi-cycle inputs capture richer temporal patterns, particularly periodic relationships, that can significantly improve prediction performance. We propose the Slack Time and Event Prediction Model (SEPM), a novel attention-based model designed to effectively learn from long multi-cycle inputs. Through extensive experiments, we show that SEPM substantially outperforms three baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability. Moreover, we identify that the number of input cycles is a critical hyperparameter. Although exhaustive search yields optimal results, it is computationally expensive. To this end, we introduce a lightweight FFT-based slack time analysis method, which efficiently estimates the effective number of input cycles closely matching those obtained from experiments. On the test dataset, SEPM achieves a median event coverage of 80.02%, significantly outperforming its single-cycle variant at 74.81%, demonstrating the substantial benefit of multi-cycle inputs. These findings validate the advantage of multi-cycle inputs and attention mechanisms in event sequence prediction. This work establishes a practical foundation for building efficient and robust predictive components in adaptive time-triggered systems."

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely used, especially in rural and remote locations where traditional grid access is limited. A major challenge associated with PV systems is their variable power output, which fluctuates due to changes in irradiance and temperature. Additionally, the dynamic nature of load demands further complicates the management of these systems. To address these issues, battery storage is commonly used to smooth out power fluctuations resulting from the variable nature of PV panels. Control techniques for PV-battery systems must effectively manage power flows and stabilize bus voltages. This paper presents a control strategy for maintaining DC bus voltage in a PV /battery system using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The proposed LQR-based controller is designed to effectively regulate the DC bus voltage, ensure power balance within the system, and minimize transients during disturbances. The performance of the proposed control approach is validated through extensive simulation-based analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing the system and managing power fluctuations."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel three-stage analytical framework, combining data preprocessing, load profiling, and operational pattern recognition, specifically designed for the high-power, nonlinear environment of silicon smelting substations. Unlike existing approaches that focus on equipment-level analytics or generic industrial loads, the proposed framework provides a unified, substation-level diagnosis capable of quantifying operational stability, variability, and functional roles within the smelting process. Application of the framework to four substations revealed distinct numerical performance signatures: Substation_1 exhibited highly stable behavior with Load Factor 1.0, and minimal variability; Substation_2 showed extreme volatility (Load Factor (LF) 0.22–0.35, Variability Index (VI) > 3000) and clear dual daily peaks at 10:00 and 14:00; Substation_3 demonstrated more efficient operation (Load Factor 0.55–0.72, Peak-to-Base Ratio (PBR) 2.5–4); and the Smelter Outlet operated as a continuous base-load unit with Load Factor 0.62–0.70 and near-zero Peak-to-Base Ratio while sustaining 20–22 MW during production. Variability-band and clustering analyses further distinguished the stable, furnace-driven load of the smelter from the flexible, schedulable auxiliary loads. The key novelty of this work lies in linking quantitative temporal load signatures to functional process roles, offering a structural view of energy behavior across smelting infrastructure. The findings provide actionable insights: flexible substations can support real-time demand response, substations with Power Factors fluctuations (0.3–1.0) require targeted reactive compensation, and grid operators gain improved visibility for forecasting and stability management, thereby strengthening grid–industry integration."

The methodology integrates a probabilistic model of target's position uncertainty with UAV flight dynamics, camera properties, and a machine learning-based detection system. It estimates undetected target probability and overall search performance, feeding into a feedback loop that combines 2D ergodic search with Model Predictive Control (MPC) of UAV altitude and velocity. Trial trajectory optimization accounts for sensing characteristics and operational constraints, producing terrain-aware, collision-free trajectories that balance area coverage with target detection. Simulations demonstrate the integration of MPC and ergodic search, enabling dynamic altitude adjustments to enhance the search performance. The control algorithm operates in real time and performs reliably under uncertainty. Field experiments provided training data, validated the method, and confirmed compliance with motion constraints. Detection rates closely match model predictions, demonstrating stable performance even under significant deviations from ideal conditions. The framework thus offers a reliable solution for autonomous multi-UAV search operations in real-world environments."

A novel scintillation detector for this purpose was developed and tested in a series of experiments at Atomfa Trawsfynydd, a twin Magnox reactor site undergoing decommissioning works in North Wales. The prototype detectors were deployed in fuel channels from the reactor charge face, and a radiation survey was conducted at a series of fixed points throughout the channel. In this presentation, the properties of the prototype detectors are examined, particularly their efficiency, noise characteristics, and gamma sensitivity. The results from the experiment are presented and evaluated in comparison to a trepanning study which was conducted in July 2022. Preliminary analysis demonstrates that the detector system is capable of measuring <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\beta$</tex> activity as a function of depth inside the fuel channel and provide a pulse height spectrum at each position."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for data privacy protection in IoV, federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted. However, traditional FL struggle to meet the practical requirements of IoV: vehicles must simultaneously handle dynamic and heterogeneous task combinations, while variations in sensor configurations lead to typically non-independent and identically distributed data characteristics. To address the dual challenges of task and data heterogeneity, we propose FedNash, a Nash equilibrium-based federated multi-task learning framework featuring an encoder-decoder decoupled architecture. FedNash utilizes the Nash bargaining agreement, and models multi-client collaborative efforts as a cooperative game problem, focusing on encoder aggregation to maximize the sum of clients’ logarithmic utility functions, thereby achieving a Pareto optimal solution. This approach ensures privacy and knowledge sharing while accomplishing a fair and efficient global feature representation learning. Furthermore, we employ a decoding aggregation mechanism that incorporates a hierarchical attention model to dynamically adjust the mapping of shared features to task-specific outputs, facilitating both knowledge transfer and isolation among heterogeneous tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL-Context and NYUDv2 datasets demonstrate that FedNash outperforms baseline methods in both single-task scenarios and cross-dataset heterogeneous task scenarios."

Although regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to address these concerns, enforcement remains under the control of the platforms themselves. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving recommender system that minimizes personal preference data exposure while maintaining the potential for equivalent personalization accuracy (including for advertisements) through local data processing, which could access the same amount or more of pure user data than server-side models. This system integrates a lightweight client-based machine learning model to infer user preferences locally, combined with Merkle tree-based Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) scheme to anonymously authenticate user requests. The authors develop a working web app prototype and evaluate performance across a range of user devices. Results show minimal latency for the client-based model (under 5 milliseconds on most devices) and diverse proof generation times, ranging from 2.6 seconds to over 18 seconds, depending on hardware capability. Server-side verification remains consistent and fast under 250 milliseconds. Although proof generation latency remains a bottleneck for real-time applications, optimization strategies such as proof-caching, cross-application preferences synchronization, and native implementation provides a promising path toward privacy-preserving personalization in social media systems."

Then, lane features are enhanced using binarization. A threshold is set and the lane edges are extracted using the Canny operator.

Yet, it remains a challenging task due to low image contrast and complex vessel structures. This paper introduces a novel hybrid methodology that combines a bio-inspired vision model, the Steered Hermite Transform (SHT), with a deep learning architecture for robust vessel segmentation. We leverage the SHT to decompose each angiogram into a rich, multi-resolution set of 15 feature maps that capture local image structures at different scales and orientations. These Hermite coefficients, along with the original image, form a 16-channel input tensor used to train a U-Net. This approach enables the network to learn from an enhanced feature space that explicitly represents vessel-like patterns. Evaluated on a public dataset of 134 coronary angiograms, our model demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.9872. The results confirm that enriching the input of a deep neural network with SHT coefficients significantly improves its ability to identify and segment complex vascular networks accurately."

With advancements in technology affecting the game industry, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer efficient and practical ways to create enemy behaviours. Proximal Policy Optimization, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, has shown potential in addressing various agent and environmental issues by focusing on improving policies and optimizing AI agents in terms of reward mechanisms. In this study, we create a turn-based tactical strategy game, MECH.AI, and implement PPO on the NPC enemies. Our evaluation of MECH.AI demonstrates that the AI agent provides an enjoyable challenge to players, and the learning with curriculum is preferred. This indicates that the AI Agent can successfully learn strategies through DRL. While this study reveals the potential of DRL to provide significant advantages over classic AI techniques, we also acknowledge limitations related to environmental observation parameters and AI Agent statuses. This research contributes to the growing body of work exploring the use of DRL in game AI and provides insights into its potential for creating more adaptive and engaging gaming experiences."

The system employs supervised machine learning via a Random Forest classifier, selected for its balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Four distinct models were created utilizing labeled Zeek connection logs, attaining classification accuracies of 99.98% for LOIC and Slowloris, and 100% for HOIC and GoldenEye. A cross-tool evaluation exhibited robust generalization, with detection rates varying from 81.12% to 100% across different tool combinations. The majority of models achieved over 99% accuracy in recognizing novel attack types, hence confirming their adaptability to various DDoS patterns. A prototype for real-time detection was developed utilizing Apache Kafka to disseminate Zeek data for immediate classification.

The realization of filtering and power division functions is achieved by using an input coupled feeding line, an asymmetric stub loaded open-loop resonator and two output ports. By adjusting the coupling width and gap of the coupling line to control the external quality factor, the designed FPD can achieve good broadband filtering performance. When the length difference between two output ports and the input port is half a wavelength, the signals at the two output ports will have a phase difference of 180°. In addition, in order to improve the frequency selectivity of the designed FPD, stub loading technology is used to symmetrically load two open stubs at the end of the openloop resonator and introduce a controllable transmission zero at the passband edge. Simulation results indicate that the minimum in-band insertion loss is 2.5 dB, the 3 dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) is approximately 25.3%, the return loss is greater than 15 dB. The amplitude difference between ports is less than 0.9 dB, and the phase difference between ports is within $180^{\\circ} \\pm 7^{\\circ}$.

First, the experimental setup and principle scheme used in the experiment are introduced, with emphasis on elaborating in detail on the laser system, cooling sequence, optimization steps, and algorithm flow. Then, the influence of different network structures on prediction performance is analyzed. Finally, the optimization scheme is verified on an actual atomic cooling experimental setup. Experimental results show that the optimization algorithm can accurately predict the optimal parameters of the experimental setup. Compared with manual optimization, the proposed scheme achieves a more significant cooling effect, with the temperature improved by approximately a factor of two in both horizontal and vertical directions."

    "abstract": "With increasing technological complexity and system openness, intelligent connected vehicle communication networks face an unprecedentedly broad attack surface. Once weaknesses are exploited by intruders, vehicles will suffer serious security issues and even threaten human life. As an important means of proactively detecting network vulnerabilities and preventing cyberattacks, penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities promptly in vehicle network. However, traditional manual approaches are plagued by high costs and limited coverage. This paper proposes an automated penetration testing method based on deep Q-learning, which applies agent to learn optimal penetration testing strategies autonomously. The proposal regards penetration testing as a Markov decision process and specifically designing the multi-dimensional state and action space, as well as reward function. Moreover, it employs the deep Q-network that combine experience replay and target network mechanism to train the agent. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher learning efficiency and enhanced exploration capabilities in complex vehicle network environments."

    "abstract": "Low-light object detection methods have made considerable progress, but there are still some difficulties in detecting objects because of poor visibility, loss of detail, and color distortion. Currently available detectors and decoupling improvement methods often struggle to extract discriminative features or introduce artifacts that interfere with detection. To mitigate the adverse effects of poor visibility and color degradation, we propose a novel CAPNet, which combines low light intensity and semantic feature fusion to achieve robust object detection under challenging illumination. An adaptive color recovery (ACR) module was designed for Retinex decomposition and reference-free statistical priors to achieve the recovery of natural chromaticity. To amplify the high-frequency structural details suppressed by insufficient lighting, we adopt a Dynamic Wavelet-Based Fusion (DWB) module for frequency domain analysis. A Feature Enhancement Gated Detector (FEGD) integrates the enhanced low-level features with high-level semantic representations. It can not only highlight the obvious information of the object, but also restrain the noise. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPNet achieves superior object detection compared with state-of-the-art methods under low-light conditions."

    "abstract": "The fast acceptance of Artificial Intelligence technology by Financial Technology operations produced major changes in fraud prevention systems while simultaneously advancing credit evaluation practices and automated trading methods and customer service operations. FinTech systems became more susceptible to adversarial attacks because the recent technological advancement has introduced malicious input designs for deceiving AI models and altering their results. These malicious assaults cause severe damages to financial security while violating both privacy standards and the public belief in AI as a service provider. The research investigates future trends of adversarial attacks aimed at FinTech AI models by examining attack classifications which involve evasion and poisoning and inference attacks together with the specific vulnerabilities found in financial sector machine learning algorithms. Empirical evidence and real-world case studies demonstrate how harmful modifications in fraud detection methods and trading algorithms as well as credit rating assessment techniques become possible via malicious manipulations. An evaluation of contemporary defence approaches including adversarial training, robust optimization, input preprocessing and model uncertainty measures takes place in the paper. This paper evaluates how explainable AI (XAI) together with regulatory frameworks strengthens both transparency and resilience of systems. The research advances understandings about safeguarding financial services AI while delivering practical steps that FinTech practitioners and policy officials and academic researchers need to create reliable trustable AI environments in FinTech."

To mitigate data scarcity and enhance accessibility, we investigate the generation of synthetic DTI scalar maps—specifically mean diffusivity (MD)—from structural 3D volumetric T1-weighted brain MRI using a reversible generative adversarial network (RevGAN). Unlike conventional pipelines requiring multiple steps, our approach enables a single-step translation from T1 to diffusion-derived measures. We assess the quality and utility of the synthetic maps in two downstream tasks: sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification. Performance comparisons between models trained on real and synthetic DTI maps demonstrate that RevGAN-generated images retain meaningful microstructural features and offer competitive accuracy, underscoring their potential for data augmentation and analysis in neuroimaging workflows. We also examine how well models trained on these data generalize to a new population dataset from India (NIMHANS cohort)."

The main attention is paid to the automated creation of annotated datasets for training deep learning models, which is a relevant task in biomedical applications, where manual labeling is laborious and expensive. A method for automatically generating blood cell labeling using classical computer vision methods and the k-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The resulting dataset was adapted to the format of YOLO models (versions YOLOv8 and YOLOv11), which were used for cell detection and classification. A comparative analysis of the results of model training was performed using the metrics of accuracy, completeness, average accuracy (mAP), and speed. The YOLOv8 model showed higher accuracy and stability, while YOLOv11 was characterized by higher processing speed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using automatically annotated data for computer vision tasks in biomedicine and confirm the feasibility of further improving approaches to automatic image labeling."

    "abstract": "Visible light positioning has emerged as a prominent solution for indoor wireless localization due to its high accuracy, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and cost efficiency. However, in complex indoor environments such as smart warehouses or automated guided vehicle navigation systems, VLP performance is frequently degraded by multipath interference, particularly the interplay between line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight signals that compromises positioning accuracy. Rapid environmental dynamics further challenge stable real-time localization and pose estimation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dynamic joint position-pose estimation method based on a spatio-temporal feature integration network. The framework incorporates a temporal convolutional network to extract spatio-temporal dependencies from received signal strength sequences, utilizing dilated convolutions and multi-scale feature extraction to capture dynamic variations across temporal scales. Joint learning of spatial and temporal features enhances positioning accuracy and robustness in dynamic scenarios. Experimental results in a $\\mathbf{5 m} \\times \\mathbf{5 m} \\times \\mathbf{3 m}$ indoor environment demonstrate a RMSE of 6.79 cm, MAE of 5.98 cm, and mean pose angle error of 2.12°. The model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and achieves millisecond-level inference latency, confirming its real-time applicability."

Such systems can be used when using an autonomous power generating unit as the only power source for consumers, or in case of emergency or emergency power outages. An analysis of existing autonomous power supply systems was conducted and the relevance of this research direction was substantiated. Load schedules were constructed based on a specific example of an autonomous power generating unit and a certain list of equipment in a private house, depending on the time of day. The developed algorithms were used to assess the effectiveness of using a UPS in conjunction with an autonomous diesel/gasoline generator. The use of a UPS allows you to reduce operating costs by loading the generator to an optimal value of 75-80% of the nominal, saving fuel, reducing maintenance intervals and frequency, and harmful emissions into the atmosphere. The maximum amount of savings, depending on the system operating mode, load nature, and frequency of outages, is from 39% to 76%. Additional energy saving effect can be achieved if this system is additionally equipped with solar panels or a wind generator. This will allow for additional fuel savings and generator life. It is planned to evaluate the effectiveness of this technical solution in future studies."

Data were gathered through an adopted questionnaire covering four domains of AI literacy: knowing and understanding, using, evaluating applications, ethics and readiness. Findings revealed that pre-service teachers possess a moderately high level of AI literacy (M = 4.12) and readiness (M = 4.16), with ethics receiving the highest score among the literacy indicators. Regression analysis identified using, evaluating applications, and understanding ethics as significant predictors of readiness. Conversely, demographic profiles such as sex and academic program showed no significant impact on readiness, though differences in literacy levels were observed. Furthermore, real world application using AI tools and thoughtful analysis with ethical awareness are main drivers of pre-service teachers’ readiness to implement AI in classrooms. This study recommends the adoption of AI-related learning and development in teacher education programs, highlighting the integration of ethical awareness and group-based practices. Data highlight the need for an extensive AI skill development to better prepare future educators with the necessary tools for the demands of the fast-evolving digital learning environment."

This paper focuses on understanding how the SASE framework evolved through real-world deployments in many organizations. The paper covers the introduction of the SASE framework, its evolution with modern times, a clear definition of each core component, and the reasons behind its growing necessity. This paper will also delve into each core component of the SASE architecture, examining how they work together to deliver secure, agile, and scalable connectivity in today's digital landscape.

    "abstract": "Single-photon interference in Young's mental experiment is explained using an approximate 6-component photon wave function in coordinate representation, describing spherically symmetric emission from a single-photon source. This interference is modeled by calculating the photon detection probability density at the corresponding point on the second screen at four selected time moments. It is illustrated for emission with wavelength of 633 nm, an emission duration of 0.667 ns per photon, a slit separation of 3 µm, and a distance of 10 cm from the slits to the second screen where interference is \"observed.\" In addition to the purely quantum mechanical approximate 6-component coordinate photon wave function, a corresponding 1-component \"quasi-classical\" photon wave function is also used. The resulting interference pattern, which perfectly matches for both functions, suggests that single-photon interference phenomena can be adequately described within the framework of \"primary\" quantization of the electromagnetic field. It is emphasized that the traditional use of the essentially postulated Feynman transition amplitude to explain Young's experiment with individual particles is justified by the considered 1-component coordinate photon wave function (along with the 6-component quantum mechanical one), providing a richer description of interference not just in arbitrary units, but in units of calculable probability density, which can also be traced in terms of its evolution in space and time. Attention is also drawn to the fact that \"measurable\" (in some recent experiments) coordinate photon wave functions can only be associated with the 1-component quasi-classical photon wave functions, which are studied in detail in this article."

In this paper, we propose a novel block projection variant of the traditional RK algorithm. First, instead of updating the solution vector x using only a single row per iteration, our method selects and utilizes a block of multiple rows to perform each update. Second, to improve the convergence rate, we introduce a greedy-randomized strategy for hyperplane selection, combining the exploration of random sampling with the efficiency of greedy choices. In addition, an error estimation step is incorporated before complete error computation, which significantly reduces computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. To further enhance performance, we parallelize the algorithm by performing effective data partitioning and load balancing across computational cores. Experimental results demonstrate that the serial version of our proposed algorithm, referred to as PKRK (Randomized Kaczmarz with Parallelizable Blocks), achieves up to 59.85× speedup compared to the REK algorithm, and 32.37× speedup over the RDBK algorithm. Moreover, the parallel implementation of PKRK with 8 cores delivers up to 5.2× acceleration compared to its single-core counterpart."

    "abstract": "In this paper, based on the previously developed algorithm for controlling the unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous flight over a railway without using satellite navigation systems, the algorithm for monitoring the unmanned aerial vehicle flight altitude based on machine vision is proposed. This algorithm uses known quantities: the distance between the rails, the focal length of the camera lens, and the tilt angle of the camera's optical axis relative to the horizon. The research results showed that the accuracy of altitude determination is significantly affected by the camera lens distortion and the change in the tilt angle of the camera's optical axis during the flight, that is, the change in the vehicle pitch angle. If under stationary conditions the error in the flight altitude determining does not exceed 5%, then in a real flight the error reached 50%. To account for changes in pitch angle, a three-axis gyroscope was used, and the algorithm processed its data. As a result, the altitude determination error in a real flight was reduced to 12%, which is quite acceptable for using the proposed algorithm to control the altitude of an autonomous flight, without using satellite navigation systems and unmasking lidar systems."

While deep learning models have shown strong performance in histopathological image analysis, they often struggle with noisy inputs and ambiguous structures. In this work, we present D3EU-Net, a multimodal segmentation framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with semantic and spatial conditioning to address these challenges. The model employs a transformer-based text encoder to incorporate descriptive prompts generated by a large language model, and a lightweight convolutional spatial encoder to extract prior structural cues from binary masks. These embeddings are fused within a conditioned U-Net architecture through cross-attention modules, enabling context-aware and noise-robust segmentation. Our approach models noise through an iterative diffusion process, acting as a regularizer that improves generalization under diverse conditions. Experiments on TNBC, MoNuSeg and GlaS datasets yield that D3EU-Net achieves Dice scores of 88.46%, 83.16% and 98.67% respectively, surpassing several state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. These results suggest that multimodal guidance, combining textual and spatial priors with diffusion, can enhance segmentation quality and adaptability for microscopic medical images.

However, in biomedical applications, the limited availability of labeled data combined with the inherent challenges posed by its high dimensionality makes it difficult for deep learning models to accurately classify such images. This work proposes a classification scheme that combines spectral unmixing with a Res-U-Net, and applies this pipeline to ex-vivo placenta MSI data. The unmixing stage serves two main purposes: (1) to extract physically interpretable spatial features from the MSI data, and (2) to reduce dimensionality while preserving key tissue information. Spectral unmixing is computed using a multilinear mixing model to capture nonlinear optical effects. The resulting abundance and nonlinear interaction maps are then used as input to a Res-U-Net for classification. For comparison purposes, two extra approaches were evaluated: the raw-MSI data applied to a Res-U-Net, and a base U-Net with the unmixed data. Our cross-validation results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline achieves more stable generalization performance, with approximately 13.3% higher validation accuracy compared to the second-best method, along with a faster convergence in the loss function and the lowest training time."

To address these challenges, an affordable design is developed to enable broader adoption of smart agriculture practices. The system’s cost was reduced by using locally available components, a custom-designed PCB, and in-house waterproof enclosures, avoiding imported parts. To ensure suitability for harsh outdoor environments, commercially available non-weatherproof sensor circuit boards were housed in custom 3D-designed enclosures. Performance was optimized through field testing to ensure the system’s reliability. Optimization of temperature, light, and humidity sensors achieved correlations of 0.99, 0.90, and 0.90, respectively, against calibrated handheld instruments used for lab and field validation. Soil moisture and electrical conductivity sensors, stabilized by duty-cycled sensing via a switching circuit, showed correlations of 0.80 and 0.90, respectively, with the same reference. The final cost to build the sensor-based system was $113, considering all possible expenses, which is even lower than the cost of an imported sensor probe (the TEROS-12 costs $450). The developed design can help local manufacturers and stakeholders develop cost-effective solutions that are affordable for small- and medium-scale farmers."

    "abstract": "This study developed an optimized Faster R-CNN model with MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 Large backbones to detect lung diseases normal, lung opacity, pneumonia, and COVID-19 in chest X-ray images, aiming to balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency for resource constrained devices. MobileNetV2 uses return layers {4: 0, 7: 1, 14: 2, 18: 3} with input channels (32, 64, 160, 1280), while MobileNetV3 Large adopts {4: 0, 7: 1, 13: 2, 16: 3} and channels (40, 80, 160, 960), leveraging squeeze-and-excitation and hard-swish activation for enhanced feature extraction. A publicly available dataset containing annotated chest X-ray images of the four lung conditions was used. Preprocessing involved pixel normalization to [0,1], data augmentation, and resizing images to 224×224 pixels. The model was trained for 20 epochs using SGD optimizer, StepLR scheduler, mixed-precision training with GradScaler, and hyperparameter tuning with Optuna. Evaluation employed mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU 0.5:0.95. MobileNetV3 Large achieved AP@0.5 of 0.9734, mAP of 0.8595, and APl of 0.8690, showing strong performance on large lesions. In contrast, MobileNetV2 yielded better APm (0.8358 vs. 0.7890) for small nodules, with a slightly higher mAP (0.8602). Detection confidence for pneumonia reached 1 using MobileNetV3 Large. Training showed stable convergence, although strict IoU mAP was below 0.9, and limited COVID-19 samples suggest a need for broader evaluation. This study presents an efficient lung screening approach, with potential for further optimization via pruning and quantization."

    "abstract": "Current automated Grammatical Error Correction systems often fail as pedagogical tools because their feedback lacks deep linguistic rationale. To address this, our study introduces Linguistics-Driven Prompt Engineering: a framework that uses expert-designed prompts to guide a pre-trained Large Language Model to simulate a linguist’s diagnostic process without costly fine-tuning. We validated the framework in a comparative experiment on 1,000 samples, using quantitative metrics including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a novel Fine-Grained Objective Evaluation for benchmarking against a standard prompt. This research establishes a lightweight and efficient paradigm for creating intelligent tutoring systems that offer both superior accuracy and significantly enhanced pedagogical value."

    "abstract": "The modern enterprise is facing a crisis of scale in vulnerability management. With the number of new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) on pace to exceed 40,000 in 2024 alone, security teams are drowning in a firehose of alerts, while the average time for an attacker to exploit a new vulnerability has plummeted to just 15 days. This catastrophic compression of the “golden hour” for defense means that traditional, high-latency threat intelligence workflows are no longer viable. The current model, which waits for official reports, is a recipe for being perpetually one step behind the adversary. This paper details the architectural blueprint for The Public Chatter Bureau: a framework designed to close this critical time gap. It functions as an open-source intelligence agency, systematically ingesting the real-time chatter of the security community to detect the earliest signals of exploitation, quantify the potential risk from the discussion, and triage the overwhelming volume of disclosures into a prioritized queue. The framework provides a blueprint for transforming high-volume, unstructured public chatter into a prioritized stream of actionable cyber threat intelligence."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem of multi-target track correlation caused by system deviation, noise interference and dimension mismatch in multi-sensor systems, this paper proposes a high-accuracy track correlation method for missing-dimensional targets. The method constructs training samples by performing time alignment and dimensional unification on data from different sensors, then applies Kalman filtering for noise reduction. A dual-branch spatio-temporal feature extraction network is designed: one branch employs a Long Short-Term Memory-based model to extract historical trajectory information features, while the other uses a Graph Convolutional Network-based model to extract spatial topological features. Features extracted from these two branches are then fused and concatenated to form the spatio-temporal features of the trajectory. Finally, spatiotemporal features from radar and electronic warfare tracks are input into a multi-layer perceptron-based similarity calculation module. Combined with the Hungarian algorithm, this achieves global optimal matching. Experimental results on simulation datasets demonstrate that this method effectively improves track association accuracy and stability. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each module. This research not only provides a novel solution for associating tracks of missing-dimensional target trajectories but also offers valuable insights for future related studies."

    "abstract": "Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) has emerged as a powerful modality in preclinical oncology, delivering spatially fractionated, high-dose X-ray microbeams that spare normal tissue while effectively targeting tumours. However, its reliance on large-scale synchrotron facilities has confined MRT research to synchrotrons, which represents a barrier to clinical translation. Recent progress in compact X-ray source technologies such as inverse Compton scattering (ICS) sources offer a potentially transformative opportunity to facilitate MRT's advancement by providing beams with similar characteristics. This work presents the first results of a Geant4-based Monte Carlo application applied to MRT, to evaluate the potential of photon beams generated via ICS sources for use in radiotherapy. We developed a program that can simulate various ICS sources, among which the ThomX ICS source recently commissioned in Orsay, France. The beam spectrum and quality are investigated, together with dose distributions in tissue-equivalent phantoms. By providing a beam characterisation, this work supports the ongoing development of compact sources for clinical MRT applications and aids in bridging the gap between accelerator physics and medical physics requirements."

The accuracy of this time measurement is highly dependent on detector performance. Recently, efforts have been focused on utilizing Cerenkov photons generated by 511 keV gamma interactions in BGO to significantly improve timing response. Although quartz was introduced in newer MPPC models due to its superior optical properties compared to epoxy, it still presents a key limitation. The quartz layer introduces an optical interface and causes photon loss due to a refractive index mismatch with BGO. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel structure that eliminates the quartz layer and directly couples the BGO to the MPPC surface. This approach reduces photon loss at the interface and minimizes lateral photon escape caused by internal reflection within the quartz layer. Four MPPC models were fabricated and evaluated. For a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$75 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>-SPAD MPPC model, direct coupling improved CTR by 35 ps and FWTM by 180 ps compared to a conventional quartz-layer MPPC when tested with a 5 mm BGO scintillator."

The Galet supports GDML-based geometry input, allowing the direct import of realistic device models from electronic design automation (EDA) tools. It also integrates radiation environment data from platforms such as SPENVIS and OMERE, enabling mission-specific source spectra for space-relevant particle simulations. As a demonstration, we implemented and simulated a 14 nm FinFET structure to evaluate spatially resolved energy deposition at nanometer scales. Galet offers a flexible and extensible framework for studying total ionizing dose (TID), single-event effects (SEE), and radiation-induced degradation in emerging semiconductor technologies."

This gamma camera employs a coded-aperture mask based on a centered mosaic Modified Uniformly Redundant Arrays (MURAs). However, when the gamma-ray source is located outside the field of view, the MURA based mask produces artifacts on the opposite side of the actual source position. To address this issue, this study developed a coded-aperture mask based on a pseudo-random pattern. To validate the pseudo-random pattern, computational simulations were performed using Monte Carlo NPaticle eXtended (MCNPX)-PoliMi. The source term, defined to emit 662 keV gamma rays, was positioned 100 cm away from the coded-aperture mask at three separate locations: in front of, to the left of, and to the right of the mask. Computational simulations were conducted separately for two types of coded-aperture masks, and the results were compared. In addition, the two types of coded-aperture masks were implemented on the actual gamma camera to comparatively evaluate their performance. In this study, a miniature gamma camera composed of a Ce-doped 11 × 11 Gadolinium Aluminum Gallium Garnet (GAGG(Ce)) scintillator array, an 8 × 8 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array, a data processing board was used. Each gamma camera equipped with a different coded-aperture mask was evaluated in terms of image quality, field of view, angular resolution, and imaging sensitivity."

Photoncounting computed tomography (PC-CT), the focus of this research, detects X-rays on a photon-byphoton basis, allowing acquisition of energy-resolved information. This enables identification of substances within the body and quantitative evaluation of their density, offering the potential for new diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In recent years, attention has been drawn to the combined use of PC-CT and the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which facilitates the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissue, as a promising approach in cancer treatment. We developed a PC-CT system incorporating high-speed scintillators (YGAG:Ce) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), specifically multi-pixel photon counters (MPPCs), which are optical semiconductor devices. In this study, we transplanted cancer cells into mice and conducted in vivo imaging experiments to evaluate the distribution and accumulation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using our PC-CT system. These AuNPs, which tend to accumulate in tumor regions, were used as X-ray contrast agents due to their excellent imaging contrast. CT scans were performed after AuNP injection, and the resulting images across multiple energy bands were analyzed. The results revealed a clear trend of gold accumulation in certain regions of the liver, indicating the potential of PC-CT for tumor detection using AuNPs."

PSNR improved from 18.4 dB using TOF-MLEM to 25.8 dB with MAP-EM reconstruction, Compared to TOF-MLEM, MAP-EM showed marked improvements, SSIM increased from 0.37 to 0.74 and NRMSE was reduced from 0.13 to 0.06, demonstrating that integrating learned priors can effectively suppress elongation artifacts, enhance structural accuracy, and improve robustness in such challenging geometrical constraints."

These characteristics contribute to excellent energy resolution, low noise, and reliable operation in harsh environments, making them suitable for applications in nuclear research and security. This study presents the fabrication and preliminary testing of a diamond-based detector with integrated microchannels (MCs) designed to enhance geometric efficiency by minimizing alpha particle displacement prior to detection. The detector was fabricated using femtosecond laser processing and reactive ion etching on a diamond substrate, followed by chromium/gold metallization for signal collection. A low-activity uranium source was electroplated onto a tungsten probe and aligned into one of the MCs. Monte Carlo simulations using MCNP were used to estimate expected alpha counts, which showed reasonable agreement with measured spectra, validating the detector design and demonstrating its feasibility for low-activity alpha spectrometry."

Given the 10 -year operational lifetime of HERD, precise calibration of the gain for each fiber pixel and the crosstalk between pixels across a wide dynamic range is critical. To achieve these goals, a novel multichannel high-current light emitting diode (LED) calibration light source is presented. The calibration system features cascaded shift registers with AND-gate buffering to independently control multiple LED channels using a shared trigger signal, enabling precise adjustment of LED activation duration and frequency. A single-pole double-throw analog switch (SPDT) converts two direct current (DC) voltages into a pulsed signal for LED driving. The combination of a digital-toanalog converter (DAC) and a DC-to-DC converter (DC/DC) ensures accurate brightness adjustment. Moreover, energy storage capacitors are incorporated to supply high transient currents during LED activation. A 138-channel prototype has been developed and tested, exhibiting a wide light intensity range equivalent to 0.7 to 320,000 minimum ionizing particles (MIPs), a uniformity exceeding 99% and negligible electrical crosstalk. The modular design allows for channel expansion without additional inter-board cabling or increased power supply capacity."

Further estimations of sensitivity in specific regions of interest, like the whole brain or cortex, have been evaluated, achieving more than 30 % of detected coincidences. The estimated sensitivity values show potential for pushing the temporal resolution of dynamic PET imaging close to functional MRI performance."

In this work, we study the variability of end-to-end PET reconstruction using Deep Image Prior and SIREN architectures, and evaluate a self-supervised early stopping (ES) strategy based on the windowed moving variance (WMV) of the reconstruction sequence. We design experiments to isolate the effects of weight initialization, random input, and PET simulation variability, and demonstrate that the WMV-based ES method yields reconstructions close to the optimal stopping point. Our results show that self-supervised ES is feasible and enables implicit regularization through NNs without being altered by using explicit priors."

However, interaction data contains highly sensitive user behavior, and centralized modeling faces significant leakage risks. While existing privacy-preserving schemes aim to address this, they lack balance in privacy-utility trade-offs and comprehensive protection. To this end, we introduce PRGNN, a privacy-preserving framework based on a fully-separable GNN, which achieves effective protection of graph structures and node features through cross-client collaborative learning of distributed subgraphs. We first propose a high-order neighborhood aggregation module (HAM), which adopts functional encryption to realize secure multi-hop propagation through self-aggregation of local adjacency matrices, protecting the privacy of the graph structure. Then, a cross-domain secure sharing module (CSM) is designed to achieve secure feature data sharing from client domains to the cloud domain based on the output of HAM. Finally, the privacy-preserving training module (PTM) integrates HAM with CSM to achieve parameter updates. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show PRGNN achieves accuracy comparable to centralized GNNs. Compared with similar privacy-preserving schemes, its modeling efficiency is improved by at least 22.06%, and the communication overhead is reduced by at least <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.62\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>."

By employing a recovery optimization algorithm guided by multi-scale time resolution, we utilized unsupervised learning methods to achieve three-dimensional (3D) image segmentation. Subsequently, we accomplished pixel-level algorithm matching, facilitating efficient long-range 3D imaging reconstruction with significantly reduced binary frame data. Notably, after offline processing of real point cloud data collected by our system, we obtained depth images of various targets within a 4 to 10 km range. Furthermore, we successfully captured dynamic 3D video of targets at a frame rate exceeding 50 fps. The video was reconstructed using offline processing with an average of fewer than 2 photons returned per pixel. These depth results highlight the potential of the proposed system and reconstructed method for depth profiling, feature extraction, and target recognition of distant static and dynamic targets."

The method involves nitrate scavenging and luminescence energy transfer processes. Scavenging techniques are used to reveal the roles of excited and ionized states formed during the initial ionization of water, resulting in the deactivation of the luminescence source, its precursors, or both. A decrease in luminescence intensity yields with increasing nitrate concentration; however, residual luminescence persists even at high nitrate levels. We propose two distinct luminescence pathways-chemical and physical: radiative decay of a highly excited state of water and electromagnetic emission via dipole interactions, independent of Cherenkov-type phase matching."

In previous research, we developed rapid seafood radioactivity inspection systems (RS-RISs) using NaI(Tl) and PVT (polyvinyl toluene) scintillators, respectively, to monitor radioactive materials in seafood. These devices are capable of determining the concentration of radioactivity in a sample, and the parameters required for the calculation were derived from Monte Carlo simulations. In this study, the accuracy of the simulation models of the developed devices was evaluated by comparing experimental and calculated results obtained under the same measurement conditions. Three test items (i.e., oyster, dried laver, and fishcake) were used for the model validation, and a Cs-137 point source (⌼ 18 μ Ci, depending on the experiment date) was positioned within a sample container at the center and the corner of the bottom, and the center of the sample (8 cm, 14.5 cm, and 18.5 cm from the bottom for oyster, fishcake, dried laver, respectively). The background radiation was also simulated based on the measurements and included in the source spectra. The differences between the measured and simulated spectra within the ROI were found to be less than 5% for all samples and source conditions. Hence, it was concluded that the parameters calculated by the simulation model to determine radioactivity concentrations were reliable."

This work presents the design and optimization of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) core tailored for the readout and signal processing of MEMS sensors designed for terahertz (THz) detection at room temperature. We developed a modular and reconfigurable FPGA architecture that interfaces directly with an array of MEMS resonators characterized by a frequency addressing scheme. The core includes signal generation using a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) for actuation and demodulation, digital lock-in amplification, and a proportional-integral (PI) feedback control for automatic resonance tracking through a phase-locked loop (PLL) architecture. Furthermore, the core is responsible for the completely automated search of the resonances, exploiting the finite number of bits of integral component within the PI. The number of multipliers is optimized through a time-multiplexed scheme that can be configured according to the number of sensors in use. The system was implemented on an Intel Cyclone V GX and validated using a linear array of eight MEMS bolometric sensors.

    "abstract": "The calibration of relative orientation between the camera and the two-axis turntable directly affects the measurement accuracy of the aircraft’s attitude and position for the aircraft pose visual measurement system (APVMS). Conventional hand-eye calibration methods exhibit limited precision due to the camera’s extrinsic parameter errors. The upright-inverted mirror method is incapable of calibrating the roll angle, and it becomes unsuitable when there exists a significant displacement between the camera and the turntable rotation center. Therefore, we propose a method based on the upright-inverted mirror and plumb lines. Firstly, based on the 3D marker corresponding to the principal point in the upright mirror as a reference, we calibrate the yaw and pitch angles between the turntable inner frame and the zooming camera by calculating the pixel displacement of the 2D marker between the upright mirror and the inverted mirror. In addition, we calibrate the roll angle by identifying the plumb line whose inclination angle is independent of the pitch angle of the turntable. To obtain image features robustly, we employ an affine transformation method based on keypoint matching to extract the 2D marker in the inverted mirror and use the Gaussian curve fitting technique to extract the centerline of the plumb line. Through simulation, we analyze the impact of different error factors on calibration accuracy and determine the number of plumb lines and the times of turntable pitching. Furthermore, we validate the superiority of the proposed method compared to the hand-eye calibration method on noise robustness in calibrating the rotation angles within the APVMS. This proposed method can be applied to calibrate the rotation angles between the inner frame and the camera simply and effectively."

However, in the context entropy model, there is no deterministic correlation between neighboring channels, and it is difficult to capture inter-channel correlation as well as spatial correlation for further improving the performance. To address this issue, a Cubic-Checkerboard conTeXt entropy model (C-CTX) for LIC is proposed in this work, which is able to refer uniformly across the channel domain and maintain the correlations in the spatial domain. To make neighboring channels have more similar distribution, Cubic Checkerboard Mask (CCM) with channel- wise mask convolution is utilized to achieve uniform distribution in different domains and Channel Wise Re-Arrangement (CWRA) is performed in terms of entropy. Based on CCM and CWRA, two Feature Disentangle Modules (FDMs) are designed in C-CTX to project the context information within sub-spaces for catching spatial correlation and channel correlation separately. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works on six datasets, i.e., Kodak, Tecnick, CLIC'20, CLIC'21, CLIC'22, and JPEG-AI."

    "abstract": "Carbon-ion radiation therapy (CIRT) offers superior dose conformity and biological effectiveness compared to conventional photon-based radiotherapy. However, maintaining treatment accuracy throughout a multi-day therapy is currently based on CTs with a frequency determined by physician experience. Therefore, there is a clear need for tools enabling continuous and objective (semi-)automatic assessment. Our group has developed a custom multi-detector system using pixel-based Timepix3 detectors to capture secondary charged particles during therapy, aiming at clinical in-vivo monitoring without added CT scans. The system is already in clinical evaluation in a trial at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center (HIT) with skull-base and neck cancer patients. Building on our own work in secondary particle-based depth detection, we now extend the approach to enable full three-dimensional reconstruction of anatomical changes by analyzing variations in secondary emissions across treatment fractions. This study presents a robust method for detecting and 3D localizing anatomical changes solely from secondary particle data. We introduce a multi-perspective reconstruction approach that enables volumetric mapping of anatomical variation by combining spatial and frequency-domain analysis. This dual-domain strategy improves sensitivity to subtle anatomical shifts while ensuring robustness against patient variability and noise. The reconstructed changes can be co-registered with planning CTs, offering visual and quantitative insight into their potential impact on dose distribution. Validation using simulations and irradiation experiments with PMMA head phantoms demonstrates the method's accuracy and robustness, supporting its role in adaptive treatment strategies for long-term precision in dose delivery."

    "abstract": "The Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) mission utilizes compact gamma-ray detectors on nanosatellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) to monitor gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and other transient sources. The detectors are based on silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays coupled with GAGG:Ce scintillators. Although SiPMs offer advantages for space applications, their in-orbit radiation damage results in performance degradation that may affect gamma-ray spectral reconstruction. To address this challenge, this study investigates the effect of SiPM radiation damage on GRB spectral analysis in GRID detectors. We first quantify the radiation-induced deterioration in energy resolution and then integrate these effects into the detector response matrix (DRM). To study its influence, we compare spectral fitting results with deteriorated and non-deteriorated DRMs using detected GRB data. Our results demonstrate that, for detectors in the GRID mission with two years of in-orbit operation, while radiation damage significantly influences the energy resolution and causes deviation in the DRMs, the resulting biases in spectral fitting results (photon index and cutoff energy) are less than their own 1σ uncertainties, indicating a statistically insignificant impact on scientific conclusions. This finding confirms the feasibility of SiPM-based detectors for long-term GRB monitoring missions in LEO. Furthermore, the proposed methodology for incorporating radiation effects into spectral analysis provides a reference for other SiPM-based space missions in the future."

    "abstract": "We present a new method for gamma spectrometry efficiency calibration using 3D scanning-based modeling of source-detector geometry. In conventional efficiency calibration, accurate efficiency calibration requires the sample to replicate the geometry of certified reference material (CRM). However, when the sample has a complex shape, reproducing an identical geometry becomes difficult of infeasible. To address this issue, we utilize 3D scan data to extract the relative positions of the source and the detector. These spatial relationships are implemented in Monte Carlo simulation to calculate detection efficiency under the actual measurement geometry. The proposed method was experimentally validated using CRM-filled sources with irregular shapes. The calculated activities showed agreement within a 5 % significance level. This proposed method is particularly advantageous when source-detector geometry is complex or when the geometry is not fixed. It eliminates the need for physical repositioning and allows rapid modeling of the actual measurement geometry. Moreover, it offers the reliability and applicability of gamma spectrometry by modeling the source-detector geometry more accurately across a wide range of measurement geometries."

    "abstract": "Constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) have been proposed to address constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), and they have shown promising performance on small-scale problems. However, for CMOPs with large-scale decision variables, complex coupling relationships among variables and the huge search space make the algorithm converge slowly and difficult to find feasible solutions. Therefore, this study proposes a large-scale CMOEA based on variable adaptive optimization and population reconstruction to better solve large-scale CMOPs. First, a variable adaptive optimization strategy is developed in the global search stage, where convergence-related and diversity-related variables are adaptively selected for optimization. This strategy reduces the variable optimization difficulty caused by complex coupling relationships and explores the entire search space to locate regions near the constrained Pareto front (CPF). Then, in the local search stage, an archive-assisted population reconstruction strategy is proposed to generate an initial population by using promising solutions from the global search stage to rapidly guide the population towards the CPF. The experiments are conducted on 43 benchmark problems with up to 1000 decision variables and five real-world problems. Results show that the proposed method has better performance than other latest algorithms."

In the DC induction heating system, aluminum samples in the sample holder are rotated around a rotation axis orthogonal to the magnetic field. To apply a strong magnetic field to the samples, the conduction-cooled split coil pair consisting of eight rectangular REBCO double pancake (DP) coils with an inductance of about 200 mH each was fabricated and confirmed to generate the designed magnetic field. Observations of molten aluminum samples in previous experiments and analysis using Hartmann numbers indicate that the movement of molten aluminum in the holder reduces the velocity of rotation in a magnetic field. Wrapping the aluminum samples with stainless-steel sheets and fixing them in the sample holder, the molten samples were able to rotate smoothly with the holder in the magnetic field. A melting test was performed by rotating the aluminum sample at 1,115 rpm in a magnetic field of about 900 mT using a split coil pair, and it was confirmed that the aluminum sample could be completely melted. Measurements of the motor input revealed that this is a highly efficient melting method and enables aluminum melting in a short period of time."

    "abstract": "Innovation is a fundamental driver of economic growth, regional competitiveness, and societal well-being. Nonetheless, its benefits remain unevenly distributed, with many regions, so called “innovation deserts,” struggling to translate potential into productivity due to systemic barriers and limited insight into the drivers of innovation. Motivated by this disparity, this article presents a novel data-driven framework for analyzing and benchmarking innovation productivity across the U.S. counties, identifying key determinants that drive regional innovation performance. The study covers over 3200 U.S. counties and includes 108 attributes spanning innovation outputs, demographics, education levels, STEM participation, internet connectivity, business sizes, and economic indicators. The framework comprises three integrated modules: 1) a hybrid feature selection mechanism combining random forest importance scores with mutual information criteria to identify influential factors; 2) a nonlinear dimensionality reduction module employing kernel-based principal component analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality; and 3) a particle swarm optimized XGBoost model (PSO-XGBoost) enabling sensitivity analysis and scenario-based forecasting. The framework demonstrates superior predictive performance (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> >0.81) compared to five other state-of-the art boosting algorithms. The analysis uncovers nonlinear relationships between key attributes and innovation outcomes, facilitating benchmarking of innovation productivity and quantifying targeted interventions to foster inclusive innovation ecosystems. The proposed framework offers policymakers interpretable, actionable insights for evidence-based regional innovation development. In particular, this study contributes a novel framework to identify innovation deserts and benchmark regional performance at a national scale."

They struggle to capture the complex dynamic relationships between adjacent nodes in road networks, to model long-term dependencies, and fully mine cross-layer feature expressions. These limitations make long-term predictions challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a GCN based on dynamic spatiotemporal and multiscale feature fusion (DGCN-STMSF). The model adopts a shared and independent stacked architecture, taking into account cross-layer feature sharing and personalized modeling, this architecture enables better characterization of the complex dynamic relationships between nodes. We introduce an exponential smoothing attention mechanism (ESA). It embeds the exponential decay mechanism into graph-structured temporal modeling. This improves the unique feature representation between layers and enhances temporal stability and trend perception. Furthermore, a fine-grained correlation enhancement module (FGCE) is proposed, featuring a dual-layer mechanism design, combined with spatial location enhancement learning (SLEL) and cross-spatial integration learning strategy (CSIL), which are used to characterize the instantaneous changes of adjacent nodes and the interactive effects between different road sections, respectively, and dynamically model complex local and global spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on four real datasets show that the DGCN-STMSF model demonstrates superior effectiveness and performance. On various datasets, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error are reduced by up to 2.14%, 5.34%, and 3.12%, respectively, demonstrating good generalization ability and application value."

    "abstract": "Arsenic poisoning remains a serious public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial to prevent severe long-term complications and implement mitigation strategies as recommended by the World Health Organization.

However, existing approaches suffer from insufficient validation and suboptimal detection performance. To address this problem, we present a novel deep learning-based approach to classify skin images into two categories: healthy and arsenic affected, using a compact EfficientNet backbone with a novel pre-processing step that suppresses irrelevant high-frequency artifacts while retaining lesion morphology and lesion-to-skin transitions characteristic of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">arsenicosis</i>.

These results indicate that combining specific image enhancements with deep learning can improve the analysis of arsenic-affected skin images. The pipeline is lightweight, easily reproducible, and transferable to real-world scenarios such as mobile or telemedical applications, enabling reliable, non-invasive screening and monitoring in arsenic-affected populations."

In this study, we explored deep learning models for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) AC using both direct and indirect AC approaches (i.e. via attenuation map (ATM) generation), introducing novel input strategies and loss function design. A dataset consisting of 940 SPECT/CT MPI scans was collected from one center. Images were reconstructed using the PyTomography package with ordered-subsets expectation maximization (OSEM), applying three iterations/subsets settings: 4I/4S, 6I/6S, and 8I/8S. The SwinUNETR model was trained with 5 -fold cross-validation (CV) across all experiments. In the direct strategy, three single-input models were trained with a direct loss (calculated between generated and true AC images). In the indirect strategy, in addition to a single-input model, a multi-input model (OSEM_3) was trained using two losses: ATM loss (predicted ATMs vs. true ATMs), AC loss (reconstructed AC using predicted ATM vs. reference AC). Four voxel-wise metrics within the body contour were reported for both ATM and AC domains, along with polar map analysis across 17 segments. Direct models showed inferior performance in all comparisons. The model with OSEM_3 input, trained with AC loss and reconstructed with 4I/4S, achieved optimal results in CV.

    "abstract": "Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being deployed in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where reliable handover management is critical to ensure uninterrupted communication. Unlike terrestrial users, UAVs face frequent handovers due to antenna side-lobe coverage and fragmented aerial cell overlaps. Existing optimization strategies, however, are often limited to coarse-grained “whether-to-handover” decisions or unidirectional cell individual offset (CIO) tuning, resulting in degraded handover performance. To address these problems, this paper proposes an Event-triggered Bidirectional CIO Optimization with Hybrid prioritized experience replay based Deep Reinforcement Learning (EBCO-HDRL) algorithm. Under the A3 event-triggered mechanism, EBCO-HDRL jointly configures serving-to-neighbor and neighbor-to-serving CIOs, improving handover accuracy and reducing ping-pong events. An event-triggered optimization strategy adaptively reconfigures CIOs only when needed, mitigating computational overhead and enhancing training stability. To further improve sample efficiency, a Hybrid Prioritized Experience Replay (HPER) scheme is introduced, combining temporal-difference error and high-reward sampling, supported by a heterogeneous neural network design. Simulation results show that EBCO-HDRL significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of precision, stability, and robustness, offering an effective solution for UAV handover management in cellular IoT networks."

Additionally, in long-term commercial operations, multi-source coupled factors such as track settlement, time-varying structural parameters, loosening of mechanical components, and degradation of controller performance can severely threaten the operational reliability, safety, and passenger comfort of the train. Therefore, monitoring abnormal states of the suspension system becomes crucial. This study first classifies potential abnormal states of the suspension system into three categories: low-frequency transient anomalies, high-frequency transient anomalies, and long-term anomalies. Different anomaly detection strategies are designed for each category to achieve comprehensive and accurate monitoring of abnormal states: the Isolation Forest algorithm is used for real-time monitoring of suspension data to quickly and accurately identify transient abnormal states without relying on pre-training or data labels; an improved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model integrating the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) method is developed to eliminate noise interference, reduce modeling complexity, and improve time-series prediction accuracy. Long-term abnormal states are further identified offline using steady-state metrics of the suspension system. Simulations and experimental verification demonstrate that the proposed anomaly detection method can accurately identify various abnormal states of the suspension system."

The authors argued that this annotation scheme was chosen because it is one of the most popular annotation schemes for named entity detection tasks. Organizations, persons, and locations were selected as categories of named entities. The model was trained using the early stopping mechanism, which allowed us to select the best metric weights obtained at the 11th training epoch.

This reduces the accuracy of the force loading cyclogram implementation and complicates the design of a control system. The known approach to overcoming these limitations is to develop adaptive control systems with additional identification of force loading channel parameters. This paper examines possible approach to solving this problem by identifying the dependence of the force loading channel gain from the bench operating modes, specifically, the dependence of this gain from the control signal and the magnitude of the load force. In this paper, based on experimental studies and the results of least-squares method processing of experimental data, analytical expressions were derived that reflect the dependence of this gain from bench operating modes. The obtained relationships can be used to construct an adaptive control system and will ensure the specified requirements for the accuracy of the implementation of the force loading cyclogram."

However, small- and medium-scale models often underutilize salient visual cues and rely on rigid, unidirectional fusion, leading to inaccurate reasoning. We propose a Science Question Answering approach that enhances visual encoding with an improved Triplet Attention module and introduces a Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (BCF) mechanism for dynamic semantic alignment. Within a stage-aware two-step framework, the model first generates rationales and then predicts answers. On the ScienceQA benchmark, our method surpasses the MM-CoT baseline by 1.16% average accuracy without increasing model size. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of visual enhancement and adaptive fusion, demonstrating improved semantic representation and more robust reasoning."

    "abstract": "Intelligent hydroponics systems, incorporating IoT and machine learning, can become a precision agriculture solution. However, sensors such as water pH sensors are expensive, and a low-cost solution can be proposed using virtual sensors. Our research aims to propose a pH virtual sensor for Hydroponics IoT. The first step of our study involves utilizing secondary data from Kaggle. We employ random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithms for the prediction. This model is built using data from the TDS meter and temperature sensor as input features. Some metrics for testing are the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score. We also employ a moving average method to enhance the model’s performance and validate the data using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) matrix. The test results show that the moving average with a window size of 181 can reduce the RMSE of the KNN regression model from 0.98 to 0.30, respectively. The benchmark results show that KNN achieves a more optimal R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score than the decision tree and XGBoost models, with values of 0.91, 0.91, and 0.57, respectively. Finally, virtual pH sensors with KNN regression are the most valid virtual sensors, as the correlation values of pH with TDS and water temperature are -0.34 to -0.35 and -0.44 to -0.31, respectively, when compared to the secondary dataset. This virtual sensor can be a low-cost solution in IoT hydroponics because it can reduce product costs from USD 400 to USD 10."

To implement this on a UAS, the solution must be low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) to minimize the impact on the UAS payload limitations and flight time.

Recent code changes made in the 2023 Edition significantly impact various industries, particularly regarding the use of prefabricated structures in brownfield applications. One key amendment is the egress requirement added to sections 110.26 and 110.33 for equipment under & over 1000V. This code requirement is to be treated independently from working clearance and specifically necessitates that 24 inches of egress are made available in all aisles while equipment doors are concurrently open. The implication is that buildings will be designed with larger footprints, additional shipping splits, and will likely become more expensive to construct. Engineers must adapt to provide innovative design methodologies to meet these demands. This paper reviews the egress code requirements, impacts to industries, and some of the devised strategies to meet standards and promote a safer electrical infrastructure."

Rapid detection of klystron overcurrent faults is essential for maintaining its operational efficiency.

To address this issue, we designed a high-speed data acquisition system specifically for capturing klystron body overcurrent transients. The system employs STM32+FPGA architecture to achieve 20 MSPS sampling across four channels. A QT-based host application allows for threshold configuration, real-time waveform visualization, and data export. Validation tests show the system's capability to record transients with a maximum duration of 20ms. This system enables rapid fault analysis and significantly reduces the diagnostic downtime of the EAST LHCD system."

The research combined theoretical analysis, simulation verification, and experimental circuit implementation to construct a wireless energy transmission system using a parallel resonant circuit as the core. By forming resonant units with inductors and capacitors, both actual debugging and simulation results demonstrated that the system operates in Class C amplification mode with low waveform distortion. A magnetically coupled wireless transmission model was further developed, enabling efficient energy transfer at medium distances when the transmitting and receiving coils were tuned to resonance and impedance-matched. The effect of power transmission was visually confirmed through changes in LED brightness. Frequency sweep analysis indicated that the system reaches maximum impedance at the resonant frequency, accompanied by a phase difference close to -180°, which aligns with theoretical resonant behavior. This paper offers practical insights and a experimental foundation for both educational instruction and engineering applications of magnetically coupled resonant wireless power transmission."

In this work, we introduce a new RAB framework based on Wasserstein-distance ambiguity sets, which provide a richer description of distributional shifts compared with classical moment-based approaches. This formulation yields a convex reformulation of the MVDR problem, making the method computationally efficient. Unlike existing designs, the proposed beamformer explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the desired and interference steering vectors without assuming precise prior knowledge of their statistics. Simulation studies confirm that the approach achieves superior SINR and improved stability relative to conventional methods, highlighting its robustness and practical relevance in uncertain scenarios."

    "abstract": "Achieving robust point cloud registration in dynamic environments remains challenging. Conventional voxel downsampling often leads to loss of geometric information and shows limited adaptability to complex scenes. To address this, this paper proposes a robust registration framework that combines density-based clustering and dynamic object removal. Ground segmentation is first performed to eliminate ground influence; non-ground points are then clustered using DBSCAN, and dynamic objects are identified and removed via frame-graph cluster association to obtain a relatively static environmental point cloud. On this basis, the point cloud is divided into two categories: high-density and sparse. Point-to-plane ICP is applied to highdensity points to fully exploit local planar constraints and improve convergence stability; point-to-point ICP is applied to sparse points to preserve edges and fine structures, while down-weighting and outlier-suppression strategies are used to reduce noise interference. The two registration results are finally fused in a unified pose estimation, achieving more stable convergence and higher localization accuracy across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method attains higher accuracy and robustness than voxel-grid baselines on public datasets and real-vehicle tests, with particularly strong performance in dynamic urban scenes."

    "abstract": "Driven by progress in generative AI, deepfake technology can now generate results indistinguishable from reality, thereby eroding public trust and enabling new forms of fraud and misinformation. At the same time, detecting such forged content is becoming progressively more difficult. In recent years, detection methods that fuse spatial and frequency domain features have drawn considerable attention due to their potential to compensate for the limitations of single-modal approaches. However, most existing methods rely on specific frequency patterns, resulting in limited generalization capabilities. Traditional frequency domain analysis, while effective at capturing global representations, struggles to integrate with spatial features, leading to the loss of critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose a dual-domain collaborative detection framework named FFRNet, designed to enable robust and efficient cross-domain feature modeling and fusion. Specifically, a Fourier Convolution Unit (FCU) is introduced to enhance frequency features for better perception of large-scale artifacts while preserving local spatial structures. Additionally, a Bidomain Nonlinear Mapping (BNM) module is developed to align spatial features with phase spectrum transformations, facilitating deep interactions between spatial and frequency domains. This framework systematically explores common forgery traces in the frequency domain and establishes a stable pathway for cross-domain interaction, thereby improving the overall perception of fine-grained forgery cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FFRNet effectively captures frequency-domain artifacts in generated images and fully leverages the complementary nature of spatial and frequency information. On multiple benchmark deepfake datasets, FFRNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing superior performance in both detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization."

    "abstract": "This research aims to determine the difference in the reading comprehension abilities of students who learn to integrate the Padlet platform in project-based learning (PjBL) from those who learn conventionally. The research used a quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental type in a nonequivalent control group design model. The population in this study was all 4th-grade students at SDN 3 Parepare, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The sample was 36 students in class 4.1 for the experimental class and 35 in class 4.2 for the control class. Research data was obtained by giving a reading comprehension test. The data analysis technique is the independent sample t-test. Based on the inferential statistical analysis results, Sig (2-tailed) is 0.024 and less than 0.05, so H0 is rejected, and H1 is accepted. Thus, this research concludes that there is a difference in students' reading comprehension abilities in integrating Padlet in PjBL with conventional learning. Integrating the Padlet platform in learning can be an alternative strategy to improve students' reading comprehension abilities."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent systems (MAS) have shown great advantages in complex tasks such as disaster response and UAV swarm control. However, problems such as the dynamic obstacle avoidance, real-time collaboration, and scalability still have not been addressed. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Based Reciprocal Velocity Policy Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ARVP-MADDPG) algorithm, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates Multi-Head Attention, Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), and curriculum learning. Notably, we include Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) strategy into the reward function to support the multi-UAV cooperation in the dynamic environment. First, UAV kinematics and detection models are constructed, and dynamic obstacles with linear motion patterns are simulated to create a realistic testbed. Subsequently, a reward function integrating Approaching Reward, Distance-Based Safety Reward, RVO-Based Safety Reward, 3-Stage Round-Up Reward and Completion Reward is designed to guide the UAV for tracking, encirclement, and capture tasks. The Multi-Head Attention boosts the cooperation efficiency in the centralized critic and the Prioritized Experience Replay(PER) improves the policy convergence. Finally, curriculum learning divides training into two stages: dynamic obstacle avoidance and task-specific encirclement, ensuring progressive performance improvement. Experimental results show that ARVP-MADDPG outperforms traditional methods and other reinforcement learning models in task completion rate, collision avoidance, and path planning efficiency, validating its robustness and applicability in simulation environments that reference real-world conditions. Comparative experiments demonstrate that ARVP-MADDPG increases the task completion rate by 64.39% and 63.30% compared to MADDPG and MATD3, while reducing the collision rate by 6.36% and 4.24%."

    "abstract": "To achieve high speed and efficiency in digital data processing, it is important to choose the right computing resources. It is known that specialized digital signal processors and graphics processors for processing data such as signals exist, but these computing resources are not available in all studies. This study examines the possibility of maximizing the use of available resources in cases where specialized hardware resources for signal processing are insufficient. In this case, it is advisable to use a modern multi-core processor designed for general-purpose tasks. However, since the processors are adapted for sequential processing, parallel processing of signal filtering processes is performed in this processor. Since the processor can provide a sufficient level of parallel processing based on the L1, L2, and L3 cache memory systems, the Open Multi-Processing programming model, with its capabilities, can significantly accelerate signal filtering processes performed by parallel processing tools in processors with shared memory. In this case, the signal data is divided into frames of 8, 16, 32,... 2048, and each frame is evenly distributed among the processor cores using Open Multi-Processing, and parallel calculations are performed simultaneously. When implementing parallel filtering of the moving average and root mean square methods for signal filtering on a 4-core (8-thread) processor, the acceleration was ~1.2-2.5 times for small frames, ~3.5-3.8 times for medium frames, and ~4.4 times for large frames."

The period of the interference field carries information about the location of the waist. To determine the divergence angle, the width of the radiation beam in the plane of recording the period of the interference pattern is additionally measured. The location of the waist and the value of the divergence angle are calculated using the formulas of Gaussian optics. The results of experimental verification allow us to recommend this method as less labor-intensive and more accurate than known methods."

    "abstract": "The article proposes approaches to solving the problem of the inefficiency of general primary frequency control in isolated power systems in a number of emergency situations. Isolated power systems face particular challenges due to low inertia, lack of spinning reserve and high sensitivity to load disturbances. These factors exacerbate transient processes and can provoke undamped frequency oscillations during general primary frequency control – the first level of automatic response to frequency deviations. However, real-world experience shows that standard general primary frequency control algorithms may not suppress frequency oscillations with low damping, but rather create them. System operators around the world have recorded cases where regulator settings that nominally comply with standards for general primary frequency control don’t prevent oscillatory transient processes lasting several minutes. These cases highlight the importance of the general primary frequency control process in managing the stability of power systems. The paper proposes new adaptive methods for solving the operational problem of stability control and frequency oscillation suppression during general primary frequency control in isolated power systems."

In this study, we investigate a sparse SNN trained with a recursive least-squares (RLS) learning rule to assess its ability to stabilize chaotic recurrent activity and reproduce target trajectories. Using layered analyses, we first evaluate the fidelity of spiking dynamics and decoder weight adaptation during learning, then benchmark runtime performance of conventional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on baseline CPU and high-performance computing (HPC) accelerated GPU platforms. Finally, we extend benchmarking to RLS-based sparse SNNs, revealing that while ANNs consistently benefit from HPC accelerated parallelization, SNNs exhibit non-monotonic scaling. For RLS sparse SNN, while baseline execution outperforms HPC acceleration at small to intermediate network sizes, HPC acceleration dominates at larger scales. These findings highlight fundamental differences in computational scaling between matrix-driven ANNs and event-driven SNNs, and emphasize the need for optimized simulators and neuromorphic hardware to fully exploit brain-like intelligence."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of the ultrasound instrument's position within the venous lumen and the delivered thermal energy on the efficacy of vein occlusion. A two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was developed including a rabbit ear vein (lumen diameter 1.5 mm, wall thickness 0.12 mm) and a needle-shaped ultrasound instrument (diameter 0.8 mm). Two key parameters were examined in the simulation: the pullback velocity (2 mm/s and 3 mm/s, corresponding to linear endovenous energy density (LEED) of 9.5 J/cm and 6.3 J/cm at 1.9 W power) and the gap between the instrument and the venous wall (0, 0.35, and 0.7 mm). The model solved coupled acoustic-thermal equations to simulate temperature fields and estimated thermal damage using the Arrhenius integral. The simulations demonstrated that for all combinations of pullback velocity and gap size, the peak temperature at the venous wall's inner surface exceeded the critical threshold of 70 °C required for collagen denaturation and vein occlusion, ranging from 77 °C to 130 °C. The results confirm that the proposed method is effective in achieving irreversible venous wall damage across a range of simulated ultrasound energy doses, ensuring reliability irrespective of the ultrasound instrument's centering within the vessel lumen. For preclinical study on an animal model, a pullback velocity in the range of 2 to 3 mm/s was selected."

Next, time-domain and frequencydomain features are extracted from the selected modal component to construct a feature vector sample set. Finally, the constructed sample set is input into an ISSA-SVM model for fault diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Successfully detecting high-impedance faults due to downed or broken power distribution conductors in a timely manner has been a big challenge for decades. When an energized broken conductor makes contact with the ground, it may result in a high-impedance fault that may be a challenge to detect using traditional protection methods. This paper provides a review of the existing solutions to detect downed conductors that have made contact with the ground. It is important to highlight that these solutions detect and isolate the affected circuit section only after the energized conductor has been on the ground for several seconds or minutes. This creates a critical \"race-against-time\" scenario, posing wildfire risks and public safety hazards.This paper dives deeper into an innovative method that was developed and successfully implemented on 12 kV distribution circuits to detect and isolate broken conductors while they are in the air and before they touch the ground. The IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event and IEEE Std. C37.118 synchrophasor-based falling conductor protection solution is designed to detect and isolate broken conductors well within 500 ms of the break. This protection-speed solution is applicable to three-phase circuits along with two-phase and single-phase laterals that may be in high fire risk areas. This paper further explores the implementation of the falling conductor protection solution using Ethernet radios, and direct fiber, as well as private long-term evolution communication networks, which form the backbone of the falling conductor protection solution."

This allows for the formation of an optimal tree structure with minimal depth and improved generalization. The model was tested on a dataset containing structured features related to the behavior of a computer system. Experiments demonstrated that this approach improves classification accuracy up to 94.5% and reduces the average tree depth by more than two levels compared to standard tree-building algorithms (CART, ID3). The obtained results indicate the potential of applying evolutionary strategies in constructing baseline models for tasks related to the security and monitoring of computer systems."

    "abstract": "The study presents an information system that performs automated analysis of arrays of publications from online media and social networks to identify primary sources and routes of disinformation spread. The methodology is based on the vector representation of texts using embedding models (local intfloat/multilingual-e5-base and OpenAI text-embedding-3-small), calculating cosine similarity, and building clusters of similar messages. A timeline graph that displays the chronology and distribution channels. Experimental testing of the system on three datasets showed the effectiveness of the approach. The OpenAI model detected clusters with high accuracy at a threshold of 0.6-0.7, demonstrating a clear visualisation of dynamics. The local model required raising the threshold to 0.85-0.9, but also provided the detection of groups of similar messages. For example, in cluster No. 6, a typical scheme of spreading a fake was recorded: from the initial Telegram post to retransmission on X and Facebook with a total delay of about 5 days. The system also allows you to detect attempts to hide the source (for example, by converting a repost into a new post) and visualise time intervals and platforms through which disinformation was spread. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is promising for information analytics, allows you to identify fake messages, and can be integrated into cyber hygiene systems or information campaign investigations."

We propose FLANet, a framework integrating global semantics with landmark-aware representations and adaptive fusion. A Landmark-aware Representation Modulation (LRM) module emphasizes discriminative regions via landmark attention and learnable modulation, while the Global-Local Adaptive Convolution (GLAC) ensures semantic alignment by generating instance-specific kernels. To further enhance robustness, we employ multi-constraint training with concentration, orthogonality, and equivariance losses. Experiments on bird datasets with complex backgrounds show that FLANet achieves superior accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating its effectiveness for fine-grained recognition in natural scenarios."

It is shown that the solution to the problem of reliable estimation of ionospheric parameters in an extended altitude interval with a sufficiently short time interval consists in improving the structure of sounding signals. It is proposed to modernize the process of pulse coding to obtain signals with specified correlation properties that make it possible calculating the ionospheric parameters both in the lower and upper parts of the ionosphere during a single measurement session. When synthesizing individual elements of the sounding signal, not only a change in the direction of circular rotation of the polarization plane of the radio wave is used, but also a change in the frequency of its radiation. For this purpose, the sounding signal should consist of groups of discrete-frequency elements representing radio pulses with different parameters. We propose to use an identifying neural network that enables estimating the parameters of ionospheric plasma in real time based on the obtained experimental autocorrelation functions of the IS signal."

    "abstract": "Transfer learning, which is widely applied in computer vision and natural language processing, enables the transfer of knowledge and experience from one domain to another related domain to build effective models. However, during the domain adaptation process, data from the source and target domains are often used jointly for training, which increases the risk of sensitive information leakage from the source domain and raises privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning model (PPSTL) that uses image pseudo-features instead of raw images. This design prevents data leakage at the visual level while resisting membership inference attacks. Specifically, the method employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to generate pseudo-features from source domain data and utilizes a domain discriminator to align the extracted features of the target model with these pseudo-features, thereby enabling accurate classification. Experimental results on 12 transfer learning tasks across the four domains of the Office-Home dataset demonstrate that PPSTL not only resists membership inference attacks and prevents data leakage but also achieves classification accuracy comparable to non-privacy-preserving models."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to perform search and tracking tasks in military and civil fields. As an emerging distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) is more suitable for UAV networks with computing modules on board. UAVs train local models while a terrestrial base station (BS) aggregates the global model, forming an air-ground collaborative federated learning (AGCFL) system. However, UAVs typically face challenges such as unreliable communication links and limited onboard resources, adversely affecting overall FL performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel FL framework with joint client selection and bandwidth allocation strategy, called FedCB, which aims to minimize the global loss function. Specifically, the strategy mitigates the negative impacts of unreliable communication links by selecting UAVs with superior wireless channel conditions while rationally allocating bandwidth resources. We have designed an alternating iterative optimization-based algorithm to solve this problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with other baseline schemes, our solution achieves significant improvements in model accuracy, fully validating its effectiveness and superiority."

A descriptive-correlational research design was employed, involving 55 science teachers from three purposively selected public secondary schools in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, Philippines. Participants were chosen through simple random sampling, and data were collected using a researcher-adapted and content-validated questionnaire with strong reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80). The instrument measured AI adoption dimensions, awareness, and readiness, institutional support, professional development, technological resources, and their correlation with AI implementation in instruction, assessment, and student engagement. Results analyzed using the Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient revealed strong and statistically significant positive associations across all dimensions. The overall level of AI adoption (ρ = 0.858, p <.001) emerged as the strongest predictor of implementation success, underscoring that effective AI integration requires access to resources, teacher preparedness, institutional commitment, and supportive leadership. These findings affirm that AI adoption is a multifactorial process, rooted in individual capacity and systemic support, and directly linked to improved teaching effectiveness, enhanced student outcomes, and greater instructional productivity. The study contributes empirical evidence to the growing literature on AI in Education, particularly within the Philippine context. It suggests that policymakers, school leaders, and teacher education programs should strategically invest in digital competencies, equitable access to AI tools, and continuous professional development to foster sustainable and inclusive AI integration in schools."

The model achieves efficient feature mining through a three-stage collaborative mechanism. First, BiGRU-MHA captures long-term bidirectional dependencies in the temporal dimension to enhance the identification of critical features. Subsequently, a designed MoE gated routing layer adaptively selects expert networks to process diverse operational patterns (e.g., fault states, peak states) based on data characteristics, thereby improving feature specificity. Finally, MLP-Mixer is adopted to decouple spatiotemporal features, efficiently integrating spatial correlations and channel interactions through independent token-mixing and channel-mixing operations. Evaluated on a real-world power private network dataset, the BM3 model demonstrates superior performance over baseline models (including LSTM and Trans-former), achieving a 12.7% increase in F1-score for fault early-warning and an 18.3% reduction in RMSE for resource capacity prediction."

Groundwater, which provides around 60% of drinking water and a significant share of irrigation supply, is of strategic importance. This study proposes the development of an intelligent computing system for groundwater monitoring, integrating sensors, networks, databases, and artificial intelligence algorithms. Due to the scarcity, fragmentation, and closed nature of groundwater data, the research emphasizes the generation of synthetic datasets that realistically reflect hydrogeological and geo-ecological variability. A hybrid modeling framework is established to simulate seasonal water level fluctuations, temperature cycles, pH dynamics, turbidity, pressure, and impedance spectra, incorporating the impacts of industrial activity and the Aral Sea. Statistical-process models and geo-ecological weighting functions are used to calibrate pollutant sources and anomaly scenarios. The synthetic datasets are validated through seasonal and anomalous test cases, ensuring distributional stability and training suitability for neural networks. The results provide a scalable approach for enhancing groundwater monitoring in Uzbekistan, supporting sustainable water management and contributing to ecological balance, agricultural efficiency, and food security."

The applicability of existing prediction models for this region remains to be evaluated.This study employs daily-resolution SSS data from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) for the period $2005 \\sim 2010$ and the region $38^{\\circ} \\sim 78^{\\circ} \\mathrm{S}$ to develop a deep learning model that integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (ConvLSTM). The model aims to capture spatiotemporal features and achieve high-precision prediction of SSS one day in advance. The CNN component extracts spatial structures, while the ConvLSTM component captures temporal dynamics and enhances spatial feature recognition.The model demonstrated superior performance on the test set (year 2010), with monthly daily-average correlation coefficients (CORR) ranging from 0.901 to 0.919, mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.108 and 0.153 PSU, and root mean square error (RMSE) between 0.146 and 0.208 PSU. It significantly outperformed standalone CNN, LSTM, and hybrid CNN+LSTM models.The results indicate that the CNN+ConvLSTM model effectively identifies spatiotemporal variation characteristics of SSS in the Southern Ocean, particularly showing robust performance in capturing the seasonal migration of high-salinity subtropical and low-salinity polar water masses. This approach provides a reliable computational tool for predicting Southern Ocean salinity and studying associated climate feedback mechanisms."

For K-Means, the optimal result was obtained at K = 4, with evaluation metrics showing SSE = 55,527,170.03, DBI = 0.53, and CHI = 2,731,977.85. For FCM, the best performance was achieved at K = 3, with PC = 0.78, PE = 0.39, and XBI = 0.13 averaged across the dataset. Binary pore masks were generated by converting clustered images to the HSL color space and selecting the darkest cluster as the pore region. When compared to the ground truth (10% pore), the proposed K-Means-Based method yielded a highly accurate pore proportion of 10.16%, outperforming the standard K-Means (10.73%) and FCM (14.65%) approaches. These results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed segmentation pipeline in accurately isolating pore regions, making it a reliable approach for digital rock analysis and related geological applications."

Finally, it integrates location-based clustering information with user reputation values into a matrix factorization framework to predict missing QoS values.

However, it faces challenges such as complex cardiac anatomy, dynamic changes in the cardiac cycle, and artifacts, particularly blurred myocardial boundaries, thin wall rupture of the right ventricle (RV) and small target loss. In this paper, we propose HAOM-UNet (Hybrid Attention and Omnidirectional Mamba UNet), an enhanced version of MSVM-UNet that introduces a hybrid attention mechanism and omnidirectional selective scanning module. Specifically, the framework upgrades the SS2D module to eight-directional OSS2D for better long-range dependency modeling, addressing issues like RV thin wall rupture and boundary blurring. It also incorporates HAOM-FFN, combining channel and spatial attention to improve small target feature extraction and suppress artifacts. Experimental results in the ACDC dataset show that HAOM-UNet outperforms MSVM-UNet, achieving an average DSC improvement of 1.09% and a significant reduction in Hausdorff distance (HD). This method effectively balances local detail preservation with global context modeling and provides an efficient, robust solution for high-precision cardiac MRI segmentation, with strong potential for clinical application."

However, this distributed, highly concurrent paradigm expands the attack surface, presenting novel security threats and challenges for anomaly detection. Current approaches remain insufficient in dealing with the interleaved requests and complex temporal-spatial behaviors characteristic of high-concurrency edge environments, resulting in the lack of unified models that can detect anomalies both at the trace and function-internal levels. To address these challenges, we propose USTAD, a system specifically designed for serverless edge computing environments, which leverages graph attention networks to capture spatial and temporal behavioral features under high concurrency. USTAD employs advanced log partitioning techniques to maintain isolated request logs, thereby avoiding log interleave. Furthermore, an enhanced provenance graph is constructed to extract crucial spatial and temporal information regarding request behaviors. For robust feature extraction, a Paired Graph Attention Network (PGAT) processes the enhanced provenance graphs, and the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm clusters the PGAT outputs for effective anomaly detection. We evaluated USTAD on 10 real-world serverless edge computing attack scenarios and achieved an average F1 score of 94.20%, substantially outperforming existing detection methods."

    "abstract": "Recently, systems for knowledge representation and processing have found increasing application in information systems and apps. This is due to the development of artificial intelligence (in particular, the development of the concept of AI agents), as well as methods of high-level development of information systems based on declarative descriptions of the subject domain. In particular, the bSystem platform for building intelligent applications is based on the use of semantic modeling methods and object ontologies as the basis for application development. In this regard, a fundamentally new task arises: managing the security of the use of logical systems and access to the information contained in them. For example, the bSystem platform is actively used to develop applied projects in the field of business management and fintech, where the critically important issue is the management of system security and policies for access to logical data. In this work, a model for access control to logical data is constructed and it is shown that this model itself can be represented as an object ontology. At present, the access control model is being implemented in the bSystem platform."

    "abstract": "The research is devoted to synthesize a controller with a fractional-order integral component to achieve the order of astaticism of the closed-loop speed BLDCM higher than 1 and with a neural network to improve the static and dynamic control accuracy. The control object is identified by a fractional-order differential equation. Four types of controllers are synthesized: a classic PID to provide settings close to the modular optimum (IntPID); a controller with a fractional-integral component that provides the order of astaticism of the loop 1.8 (FrPID), and – what is the scientific novelty of the work – hybrid controllers based on the first two, supplemented by neural networks of direct signal propagation NN–IntPID, NN–FrPID. FrPID compared to IntPID allowed to reduce the mean square error by almost 5 times, and the neural controller with a fractional integral component provided the best results: overshoot with a jump in the reference signal was reduced from 2.98% to 0.35%, the mean square error with a linearly changing reference signal was reduced by 11 times and the relative speed error decreases from 0.00801 to 0.00022, more than 35 times. The proposed algorithm for fast learning in each cycle of the control program also ensures the adaptation of the controller when the parameters of the control object change, what makes the possibility of using neural controllers with a fractional integral component for other objects, such as universal collector motors, electromagnetic brakes with adjustable torque."

    "abstract": "Gaussian filters with deterministic sample points, such as the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), Gauss– Hermite Quadrature Filter (GHQF), etc., have been widely employed for nonlinear state estimation. However, these filters utilize a fixed set of sample points irrespective of the system's nonlinearity. While various studies have explored data-driven approaches to optimize the three parameters of the UKF, these methods do not generalize well to other Gaussian filters with a greater number of sample points. In this letter, we propose a novel neural network-based unified framework for finetuning sample points across all Gaussian filters with deterministic sample points. Specifically, we first pretrain a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to approximate the mapping from the state's mean and covariance to the sample points of the original Gaussian filter. The MLP then replaces the sample points generation strategy in the Gaussian filter and is further refined by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed measurement data. Simulation results demonstrate that the Gaussian filters leveraging the well-trained MLP as the sample point generation strategy achieve higher filtering accuracy compared to their original counterparts."

    "abstract": "Accurate camera calibration is essential for obtaining precise three-dimensional information of a target. However, in the froth flotation process, it is challenging to position the calibration board support surfaces correctly. This difficulty makes it hard to capture high-quality calibration images from various angles, ultimately impacting the accuracy of the calibration results. To address this issue, we propose a planar template camera calibration method based on convolutional neural networks and synthetic data augmentation. Initially, we establish a virtual imaging scene to map the relationship between the feature map and camera parameters. Then, we conduct coarse camera calibration and apply synthetic data augmentation within specific range constraints to create a comprehensive calibration dataset. After that, we develop a deep calibration network named FSC-McCNN to facilitate the correspondence between the calibration feature map and camera parameters. This network comprises feature spatial coding (FSC) and multichannel convolutional neural networks (McCNN). The proposed approach effectively compensates for changes in camera focal length and requires only a single calibration image, thereby reducing the calibration workload at flotation sites. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real flotation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) offers significant therapeutic potential in oncology, leveraging the high linear energy transfer (LET) and short path length of alpha particles to selectively eliminate micro-metastases and single cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. However, clinical translation is limited by the lack of imaging tools capable of monitoring in vivo biodistribution and dosimetry of alpha-emitting isotopes. To address this gap, we have developed the Alpha-SPECT system—a high-sensitivity, high-resolution whole-body clinical SPECT scanner integrated with advanced CZT imaging spectrometers, specifically designed for simultaneous imaging of therapeutic alpha-emitters (such as Ac-225, Pb-212 and Ra-223) along with their decay daughters (including Fr-221, At-217, Bi-213, and Po-213 from Ac-225) in patients. The system integrates 496 micro-pinhole cameras across 31 detector panels in a cylindrical geometry, each comprising 16 CZT detectors <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20 \\times 20 \\times 6 \\text{mm}^{3}$</tex> with pixelated anodes and HEXITEC ASICs. A novel dual-FOV configuration is enabled by a precision CT-derived rotating gantry that switches between a large-field-of-view mode and a high-resolution mode. The system achieves sub-10-um gantry accuracy and a de-magnification ratio of 1:11, enhancing spatial resolution and angular sampling. Energy calibration with Ba-133 and Co-57 sources demonstrated average resolutions of 4-6 keV at 122 keV , further improved to 2.5-3 keV with machine learning-based charge-sharing correction. Ongoing geometric calibration and future NEMA-compliant performance evaluations aim to establish the Alpha-SPECT as a robust platform for clinical TAT imaging."

    "abstract": "Silicon carbide (SiC) has experienced a renaissance in high-power electronics due to its high temperature stability, high breakdown field and low power dissipation. Its high band-gap also makes it an interesting candidate for radiation hard particle detectors in high-energy physics and medical applications. Further, a high electron and hole mobility promises devices suitable for ultra-fast particle detection and timing applications. However, currently the front-end readout constitutes a bottleneck when investigating these devices. We developed a high-frequency readout board with an intrinsic bandwidth of 10 GHz. With this readout we recorded the current transient signals of a small 4H-SiC PiN diode with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$140 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> diameter and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$50 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex> thickness upon UV-laser, alpha particle and high-energy proton beam excitation. In all three cases we clearly can separate between electron and hole drift, which enables the extraction of the charge carrier drift and saturation velocities. These velocities, directly measured with transient current techniques, provide a valuable comparison with literature values and constitute an essential input for dedicated TCAD simulations. We will conclude on a complete picture of the readout electronics, electrical and TCAD simulations and possible future applications."

    "abstract": "The performance of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD), including the pre-amplifier, is constantly improving. Recently the energy resolution was improved even at short shaping time, allowing high throughput measurements in X-ray analysis [1][2]. As a direct consequence the measurement time becomes shorter and industrial applications are expanding. To reduce the measurement time further, the active area and hence the solid angle of the detector also can be increased. However, in a SDD with large active area, the drift time of the signal charge becomes longer, and it makes the rise time of the signal longer, and then the signal processing time longer. Although using multiple detectors simultaneously is one of the good solutions, the aligned detectors have dead space in peripheral areas of the respective detectors. In a SDD array, multiple SDD elements are fabricated monolithically to achieve both high throughput and large solid angle [3][4]. In such a SDD array if X-ray photons come into the boundary area between the different channels, generated charges divide and travel towards different adjacent anodes (charge sharing), or parts of the charges is not collected because of weak electric fields near the border areas. This phenomenon causes an unexpected tailing and background in the acquired spectrum. We're trying to reduce these boundary areas with weak electric fields. We add electrodes (drift rings) in these border areas on the radiation-entrance side to enhance a high electric field which drives signal charges to the read-out electrode swiftly. Our preliminary results from a single SDD prototype indicated that the added drift rings on the entrance side improve the tailing of the spectrum by 12%. Effects and technical problems of the drift rings on the entrance side will be reported and discussed."

We are currently in the stage of integrating the whole system for real-time testing with live sensor data."

    "abstract": "Segmentation of dynamic PET imaging remains a challenging task due to high noise levels, limited spatial resolution, and temporal variability in tracer uptake. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive clustering algorithm that efficiently processes large-scale, patient-specific datasets without requiring cross-subject training data or manual annotations. The algorithm dynamically adapts to temporal patterns in tracer distribution and enables robust segmentation of physiologically relevant regions. We evaluated the method using baseline PET-FLT imaging data from breast cancer patients, obtained from the ACRIN dataset in the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Imaging Archive. Results demonstrate accurate and consistent segmentation of the heart, validating the algorithm's effectiveness under realistic clinical conditions. This approach significantly enhances downstream quantitative analyses, particularly in image-derived input function extraction and kinetic modeling, and holds strong potential for application in the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scans, supporting more precise and sophisticated quantitative assessments."

    "abstract": "Identification and characterization of plutonium samples is an important safeguards challenge. The work investigates the impact of shielding on the characterization of various plutonium samples, specifically metal and oxide forms, using neutron spectroscopy with a trans-stilbene detector. This study expands on previous work by simulating various plutonium sources, including the BeRP ball, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{PuO2}$</tex>, and PuBe, shielded with high-density polyethylene. A trans-stilbene detector was simulated 30 cm away from these sources using the MCNPX-PoliMi and MPPost codes. Simulation results show that the spectral shape remains consistent at low light output but changes at higher light outputs, depending on the shielding and type of source. Source characterization is performed using spectral integral ratios: for the BeRP and PuO2 sources, the ratio increases with more shielding, as polyethylene moderates fission neutrons and hardens the detected spectrum. Conversely, the PuBe source shows a decrease in the ratio with increased shielding due to the higher energy of PuBe neutrons. The results demonstrate that a spectral ratio approach effectively discriminates these plutonium sources with up to 7.6 cm of polyethylene shielding. Experiments have been performed with these plutonium source and shielding configurations. At the conference, we will present results based on these experiments as well as simulations with a wider range of shielding thicknesses."

A circular interpolation strategy is employed to combine the ring oscillator and the interpolation technique, achieving high resolution. Initial test results confirm that the circuit's functionality and power consumption closely align with simulations, demonstrating a nominal bin size of approximately 5.2 ps. However, the time precision is degraded by abnormal bubble occurrences. These issues are likely attributed to the large setup time of the quantization D-flip-flops, insufficient signal driving capability, and propagation delay mismatches caused by layout imperfections. Further analysis and design optimizations are currently underway, with an optimized version expected to be submitted in 2025."

Their structural simplicity and small number of actuators required for operation make them highly versatile and responsive, which is crucial for effective teleoperation. In addition to grasping performance, haptic feedback, which integrates force and tactile sensing, is essential for dexterous manipulation. This study proposes a solution using fiber-optic tendons embedded with fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), combining sensing and actuation to simultaneously perform power transmission, along with force and tactile sensing. Each finger employs a fiber-optic tendon with three FBGs: one measures tendon tension, and the other two at the fingertip detect contact force and temperature. The tendon is placed on the volar side of the finger and routed to an actuation module with a servomotor at the wrist for power transmission. This tendon enables finger flexion, while a passive extension mechanism with linear springs on the dorsal side facilitates extension. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, showing the hand's multifunctional capabilities, including haptic feedback and power transmission, as well as its potential for teleoperation. This approach improves the robotic hand's ability to provide real-time feedback, improving dexterity in remote manipulation."

To address these limitations, this paper proposes an affine-structured performance-controllable neural network guided backstepping predictive control framework. Unlike conventional black-box data-driven models, the proposed approach embeds the affine nonlinear system structure into the neural network and adopts a Lyapunov-based training strategy, enabling both accurate dynamic approximation and explicit control law design. Meanwhile, a backstepping predictive control scheme is developed to effectively handle interconnection-induced coupling and multivariable constraints with reduced computational burden. Furthermore, a performance-controllable integrated neural network adaptive update method is introduced by reformulating model adaptation as a control problem, allowing near-real-time model updating using only finite data and guaranteeing stable and rapid convergence of prediction errors. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior control performance under dynamic operation modes."

    "abstract": "In pin-hole assembly processes, precise alignment or compliance mechanisms are typically required. This paper proposes a method for connecting objects by utilizing caging to constrain their motion, enabling the insertion of a pin into a hole to adjust the allowable relative pose for assembly. This approach eliminates the need for force control, even with low-degree-of-freedom manipulators, and reduces deflection caused by misalignment during connection. Although previous research has extensively studied appropriate finger configurations for caging, the behavior of caged objects under external forces remains insufficiently investigated. Furthermore, when connecting caged objects by contact, pose estimation often requires complex collision computations that account for intricate object geometries, which are computationally expensive and may fail to converge when small gaps are present. To address this issue, we propose a geometric method that approximates pose changes of caged three-dimensional objects under external forces as rotations about contact points. As a representative case, we focus on objects composed of cuboid elements. The estimated results for simple objects, including caged objects with small clearances, were consistent with geometrically derived theoretical solutions, and are obtained within 0.6 seconds, indicating a practical computation time."

However, the majority of existing hand-motion-capture gloves do not preserve visual features of the hand, which critically hinders their applicability for automatic pose annotation in RGB images. Here, we propose a data glove based on filament-sliding linear potentiometers (FLiPo), which can maintain finger appearance and ensure high accuracy as well as robustness, paving the way for automatic annotation. In FLiPo, fine filaments (Φ.1 mm) are deployed on finger skin to transmit joint arc length variations as well as preserve the hand's visual features, while linear potentiometers used to capture filament length changes are positioned on the arm. Simultaneously, a quantitative occlusion scoring metric is proposed to evaluate the degree of finger occlusion caused by the device. Further, we experimentally analyze the nonlinearities induced by biaxial joint coupling and skin tissue artifact (STA)-related hysteresis, and employ a fully connected neural network to map arc length to joint angles with an MAE of joint angles of 2.15°. Meanwhile, tests under challenging environmental conditions, including heat, moisture, and magnetic interference, are conducted to evaluate its stability. Finally, the system's capability for real-time pose capture with high accuracy, robustness, and low occlusion was demonstrated."

While prior works primarily study ImageNav for ground robots, enabling this capability for autonomous drones is substantially more challenging due to their need for high-frequency feedback control and global localization for stable flight. In this paper, we propose a novel sim-to-real framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve ImageNav for drones. To enhance visual representation ability, our approach trains the vision backbone with auxiliary tasks, including image perturbations and future transition prediction, which results in more effective policy training. The proposed algorithm enables end-to-end ImageNav with direct velocity control, eliminating the need for external localization. Furthermore, we integrate a depth-based safety module for real-time obstacle avoidance, allowing the drone to safely navigate in cluttered environments. Unlike most existing drone navigation methods that focus solely on reference tracking or obstacle avoidance, our framework supports comprehensive navigation behaviors, including autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and image-goal seeking, without requiring explicit global mapping.

While classical and learning-based methods have shown promise, most existing approaches lack common-sense reasoning and are typically designed for single-robot settings, leading to reduced efficiency and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, we introduce Co-NavGPT, a novel framework that integrates a Vision Language Model (VLM)as a global planner to enable common-sense multi-robot visual target navigation. Co-NavGPT aggregates sub-maps from multiple robots with diverse viewpoints into a unified global map, encoding robot states and frontier regions. The VLM uses this information to assign frontiers across the robots, facilitating coordinated and efficient exploration. Experiments on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that Co-NavGPT outperforms existing baselines in terms of success rate and navigation efficiency, without requiring task-specific training. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of semantic priors from the VLM. We also validate the framework in real-world scenarios using quadrupedal robots.

In the decision layer, a safe path-velocity Q-learning (SPV-Q-learning) algorithm is proposed, which ensures the rapid generation of reliable paths by introducing a decay mechanism and safety constraints. In the estimated layer, a time-base generator (TBG)-based observer is introduced to reconstruct the leader’s state using only local interactions, then, all followers acquire the leaders state under the fully distributed estimator. In the local layer, an anti-saturation fault-tolerant law is designed to handle model uncertainties, actuator degradation, and bounded inputs, thereby ensuring high-precision trajectory tracking for all agents.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments faces severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the type of attack. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables the adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and the long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise and Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA in a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA’s enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions."

A whole gamma imaging (WGI) system, currently under development at QST, enables Compton imaging of single gamma rays and PET simultaneously, by using a double ring structure with an additional scattering detector inside a PET ring. In the previous small WGI prototypes, both scatterer and absorber detectors were optimized for radionuclides that emit high-energy gamma rays, such as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{44} \\text{Sc}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{89} \\text{Zr}$</tex>. On the other hand, for the major radionuclides often used in SPECT, detecting their single gamma rays as Compton events was difficult because the gamma rays were low energy, and most of the scattered gamma-rays were absorbed at the scatterer itself. In this study, we investigated the scintillator material and thickness of the scatterer detector of WGI to be suitable for Compton imaging of the low-energy gamma rays of 141 keV and 159 keV as the measurement target, assuming a braindedicated geometry with a 250 mm inner diameter and 210 mm axial length. We evaluated the detection sensitivity of Compton events using a Monte Carlo simulation with Geant4. As a result, a Compton sensitivity of 0.4 % for 141 keV and 0.6 % for 159 keV was achieved using <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{LaBr}_{3}$</tex> with a thickness of 3.5 mm as the scatterer detector.

However, the model's performance is often compromised by the variability and unpredictability of low-dose levels encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, while CT scans acquired during the examination provide essential attenuation maps for PET reconstruction (enabling attenuation and scatter correction), they may contribute to radiation exposure comparable to or even exceeding that of PET itself. In this study, we propose a Noise-Level-Estimation Network to restore non-attenuation-corrected low-dose PET images to their full-dose, attenuation-corrected counterparts. The model was trained on 500 total-body PET scans from Ruijin Hospital and evaluated on an independent set of 50 scans. Quantitative results demonstrated that our method significantly enhances the image quality of CT-less low-dose PET scans. This approach presents a promising strategy to reduce radiation exposure in PET/CT examinations, potentially eliminating the need for concurrent CT scans in clinical scenarios."

    "abstract": "Dual-phase liquid Xenon TPCs have been used for decades in diverse nuclear and particle physics experiments, including dark matter [1] and neutrino detection [2], thanks to their relatively low energy threshold for electron-ion pair production, and high scalability. However, a critical shortcoming arises from the high-voltage grids that provide electron amplification via electroluminescence in the liquid-vapor interface, causing parasitic photon and electron emission that significantly compromises rare-event searches. A promising solution is to implement a direct charge sensing plane featuring an array of CMOS charge-sensitive amplifier (CSA) readouts [3]. This approach eliminates the risk of hotspots and has the added benefit of potentially improving vertex reconstruction near TPC walls, where photon statistics and reflections currently limit resolution. To demonstrate feasibility, a 256-channel CSA array chip has been developed using a 180 nm CMOS process with an 1.8 V supply. The design accommodates a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$16 \\times 16$</tex> pad layout, with a tight pixel pitch to meet vertex resolution requirements. Each CSA achieves an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 3.2 electrons rms, at an 850 uA current consumption. These features are critical for dark matter direct-detection experiments, which demand high sensitivity to rare, low-energy events. This chip serves as a proof-of-concept vehicle with integrated testability features and design variations, paving the way for advanced heterogeneous integration. By stacking electron-focusing structures on the CMOS plane, entirely new detector architectures can emerge. This work highlights the potential of CMOS technology for constructing highly sensitive, low-noise, and compact front-end systems in next-generation TPC-based experiments."

To solve this problem, we have applied Noise2Void (N2V), an unsupervised deep learning method, to improve the image quality of SPECT images. In our previous study we applied N2V as pre-denoising approach to projection images. The aim of this study is to compare pre-denoising approach to apply N2V to projection images (Pre-N2V) and post-denosing method to apply N2V to reconstruction images (Post-N2V) at different noise levels. Assuming our high-resolution SPECT system with parallel-hole collimator, numerical simulation was performed to evaluate two types of N2V approaches. We prepared projection images of brain numerical phantoms with multiple noise levels, and compared the images reconstructed with Pre-N2V and image reconstructed with Post-N2V. The results showed that the denoising performance of N2V depends on the processing method and noise level. PreN2V approach was more effective when the noise level was higher. On the other hand, the difference between Pre-N2V and Post-N2V approaches became smaller as the noise level decreased. This study suggested that when N2V is actually applied for denoising SPECT images, it is important to select an appropriate processing procedure (Pre-N2V or Post-N2V) according to the noise level of the image."

This high energy resolution enables the feature of photon number resolving capability that is essential in the field of optical quantum computing. However, TES timing jitter is typically much slower than that of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD) which are quite fast but unable to resolve the number of arriving photons. Since the principle of TES signal is based on heat conductance in ultra low temperature, a remedy to overcome its slow timing response is to reduce its size. The produced heat upon absorption of the photon would propagate within a smaller area and sensor becomes hotter which means higher signal to noise ratio and much sharper rise in the signal. It is very common to use <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9-\\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex>-pitch fiber in telecommunications as well as optical quantum computing, therefore, by making the sensitive area smaller than that pitch, the detection efficiency degrades.

Extensive research is being conducted to develop reconstruction methods that provide the same efficiency as current adaptive filter methods, but with enough throughput to suit the increase in information density of HL-LHC events. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the most promising substitutes due to their high-throughput when implemented in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) while retaining high reconstruction efficiency. Most prominent works apply edge-classifying GNNs to determine whether a segment between two detector hits belongs to a particle track or not. We explore a HGNN approach, where hyperedges are defined as track candidates rather than just a segment between hits. This change in design allows modeling of relationships between hits that go beyond their pairwise connection. For graph construction, we developed a custom algorithm that follows the typical seeding stage, finding track candidates and building the hypergraph. Next, the HGNN is responsible for attributing scores to the candidates based on their likelihood to be a true particle track. This pipeline was evaluated using the ACTS (A Common Tracking Software) open-source framework to simulate HLLHC top-quark pair production events with 200 interactions per bunch crossing (pileup) on the Open Data Detector (ODD). Our pipeline achieved a global track efficiency of 92.9 % on the aforementioned events within a fiducial region, an important achievement that justifies continuing effort to optimize its throughput."

    "abstract": "Event cameras are dynamic vision sensors inspired by the biological retina, offering high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low power consumption. These qualities allow them to perceive 3D environments even in extreme conditions. Event data is continuously recorded over time, capturing pixel movements in detail. To leverage this temporal density, we introduce a temporal event stereo framework that continuously uses past information. The event stereo matching network is jointly trained with stereoscopic flow, which tracks pixel movements from stereo cameras. Instead of relying on optical flow ground truth, our method trains motion flows using disparity maps. The temporal aggregation of information via stereoscopic flow boosts stereo matching performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVSEC, DSEC, M3ED, and EVIMO2 datasets. Our method also demonstrates computational efficiency by stacking past data in a cascading manner."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the consensus control for heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to two-channel cyber-attacks over a directed network. A consensus control is a cooperative control scheme in which a group of multiple systems works collaboratively to reach similar final states in a finite time. Deception attacks targeting the input signal and the connections between agents have been considered by incorporating stochastic addition of the attack signals. The considered deception attacks are more complicated to deal with than conventional false data injection, owing to consideration of both blockage of actual signal and injection of false data. A state feedback control scheme using a dynamic estimator is proposed to achieve practical consensus among follower agents and the leader. Relevant conditions have been provided for attaining the stability and for designing the resilient controller for heterogeneous MASs to keep the consensus error uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Incorporating heterogeneous MASs, two-channel cyber-attacks, and stochastic nature of deception attacks has rendered the presented methodology more sophisticated, practical, and challenging compared to existing methods. Additionally, the proposed results have been expanded for the output feedback consensus through the incorporation of a Luenberger observer. In this context, a decoupling strategy has been utilized to ensure consensus among heterogeneous agents through resilient output feedback, considering stochastic attacks targeting two channels. The results of the proposed resilient consensus control for heterogeneous agents are verified through numerical simulations of circuits."

    "abstract": "The multi-pinhole SPECT system has the potential to visualize the dynamic behavior of radiopharmaceuticals, as it can acquire the projection data required for image reconstruction without rotating the detectors. However, a major drawback of the pinhole collimator is its inherently low photon detection sensitivity, resulting in a significant impact of quantum noise. To enhance sensitivity, it is necessary to increase the number of pinholes. In this process, however, overlapping of pinhole projections may occur, potentially introducing artifacts into the reconstructed images. Therefore, multi-pinhole SPECT systems are generally designed to avoid overlapping projections. In this study, using a three-detector quasi-static data acquisition multi-pinhole SPECT system, we acquired projection data with overlapping projections using 22 and 33 pinholes, and separated the overlapping projections employing a convolutional neural network (CNN). To demonstrate the effectiveness of increasing the number of pinholes, we compared reconstructed images obtained from non-overlapping 11-pinhole projection data with those reconstructed after CNN-based separation. The results confirmed that separating overlapping pinhole projections using CNNs allows for improved image quality as the number of pinholes increases."

    "abstract": "Wildfires are natural disasters that pose substantial threats to the environment. The accurate prediction of wildfire risk levels and timely implementation of effective mitigation measures are critical for wildfire prevention and ecological security maintenance. Fuel moisture content is an important factor affecting the spread and intensity of wildfires; however, there is currently a lack of large-scale data on surface dead fuel moisture content (DFMC). Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a more accurate method for retrieving DFMC by integrating multi-source satellite remote sensing data with machine learning algorithms. Evaluation of six retrieval models (extreme gradient boosting [XGB], linear regression [LR], generalized additive model [GAM], random forest [RF], convolutional neural network [CNN], and long short-term memory [LSTM]) confirmed the adaptability of XGB to four forest types, achieving an average R² value of 0.78. In addition, we used SHAP analysis to assess the importance of the model's influencing factors and identified the significance of soil moisture content (SMC) and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, comparative analysis of four input parameter combinations confirmed the pivotal role of SMC, with the integrated use of ERA5-Land reanalysis data and SMC data achieving optimal model performance while balancing large-scale applicability with accuracy. Additionally, a daily DFMC dataset for the Greater Khingan Mountains was constructed by integrating SMAP soil moisture data, ERA5 meteorological data, and the XGB model. In this study, we innovatively combined microwave remote sensing data with machine learning to provide a robust methodological framework for DFMC data retrieval via microwave remote sensing. Our results establish a foundation for enhancing the precision of forest fire risk early warning systems."

    "abstract": "Waseda University and Science Tokyo are developing the 65 kg small satellite GRAPHIUM, which is planned for launch in FY2026. Its main detector, named INSPIRE, is a box-shaped hybrid Compton camera that supports both pinhole mode (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$30-200 \\text{keV}$</tex>) and Compton mode (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$200 \\text{keV}-3$</tex> MeV). Simulations show that its sensitivity is comparable to that of COMPTEL. INSPIRE also possesses a wide field of view and is capable of simultaneously monitoring approximately onequarter of the sky. This feature enables the detection of transient phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts, whose locations cannot be predicted in advance. Should GRAPHIUM observe transient events originating from kilonovae due to neutron star mergers, it may provide vital insights into the currently unknown origins of heavy-element synthesis, including that of Au and Pt. In addition, we aim to observe steady sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this study, we constructed an engineering model (EM). This EM partially replicates the actual INSPIRE, integrating real detectors in selected sections, with the remaining parts replaced by massequivalent dummy components. Using the EM, we performed imaging tests with various radiation sources, along with environmental and vibration tests. By conducting imaging tests with multiple radiation sources, we demonstrated that the angular resolution measure (ARM) cut, a simple and effective technique developed for Compton camera imaging, enables the successful extraction of spectra from multiple gamma-ray sources within a single field of view. Furthermore, we assumed the Falcon 9, recognized for its stringent vibration environment, for vibration testing and conducted a qualification test to evaluate the effects of launch conditions. The results confirmed that the detector's performance was unaffected by the test."

The demand for higher performance drives advancements in detector technologies and multichannel acquisition techniques. This motivates our proposal for an innovative fully digital 3D (x-y-time) imager for hard X-rays. Key challenges in detector design include improving time resolution, spatial resolution (limited by the multipixel approach), and quantum efficiency, which is low for silicon detectors in the hard X-ray range. We propose using a Separate Absorption and Multiplication Avalanche PhotoDiode (SAM-APD) based on III-V semiconductors. GaAs-based alloys, with higher atomic number and mobility, offer significantly better efficiency and speed for hard X-ray absorption compared to silicon. Regarding acquisition systems, the shift towards multichannel methods and the need to minimize power and area per channel has led to the transition from traditional pixelated voltage-mode electronics to time-based acquisition systems, where both spatial (x and y) and timing information are linked to the detection event's time. By coupling a large-area GaAs SAM-APD (several mm in diameter) to two Cross Delay Lines (CDLs) and a 4 -channel 15 -ps precision FPGA-based Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC), we aim to achieve temporal and spatial resolutions of tens of picoseconds and hundreds of micrometers. This approach offers a powerful alternative to pixelated systems, requiring neither aggressive lithography nor one readout channel per pixel, using only four channels."

To improve the learning performance, the PASSformer is with a staged architecture to learn the highly-coupled tri-beamforming. A training algorithm is also proposed to cope with the highly non-smooth loss function. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility and generalizability of the PASSformer to different system settings and problem scales, enabling it to be deployed across diverse communication scenarios, including single-/multi-cell fully digital and hybrid transmit beamforming.

    "abstract": "In external beam radiation therapy, it is crucial to deliver adequate radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding normal tissues. However, the internal tissues within the human body constantly change their position due to breathing and cardiac pulsation, making it important to monitor tumor position externally during exposure. There are no established methods for detecting position changes of the tumor non-invasively caused especially by the movement of internal cavities (such as gas in the intestines) within the body. Therefore, this study investigated whether it is possible to monitor the behavior of internal cavities located between the tumor and a gamma camera by capturing the scattered high-energy X-rays emitted during radiation therapy. A 20 cm square acrylic block was irradiated by a beam of gamma rays from a Co-60 source that was collimated into a square column shape. A void was set at the position where direct gamma rays were not irradiated. Scattered gamma rays passing through the void were captured using a gamma camera consisting of a pinhole collimator and a phosphor plate. An increase in the amount of scattered gamma rays in the captured images was observed when the size of the void was changed from 1 cm square to 3 cm square. Experiments were also carried out with scattered gamma ray with angles of 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees relative to the incident gamma ray beam. The experimental results confirmed that the presence or absence of a void of several centimeters could be detected using scattered gamma rays at 45 degrees and 90 degrees. However, with scattering angle of 135 degrees, no change of scattered gamma ray intensity was observed. Although it is necessary to limit the scattering angle to 90 degrees or less, it has been confirmed that changes in the size of the cavity of several centimeters can be detected by monitoring the intensity of scattered gamma rays."

    "abstract": "Microseismic (MS) source localization is essential for mitigating rockburst hazards and optimizing the reconstruction of energy reservoir. However, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain highly sensitive to noise, and LSTM-FCNN models fail to effectively capture the spatial–temporal correlations among geophone arrays, resulting in degraded performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, typically below 0 dB. To overcome these limitations, This paper presents a multi-scale convolutional localization model with coordinate attention (MSCAR-Net). The model exploits the heterogeneous responses of noise and the correlated features of effective signals through multiscale convolutions, while a feature fusion strategy balances noise suppression and signal enhancement. In addition, the coordinate attention (CA) mechanism establishes spatial-temporal correlations between geophone positions and signal sequences, significantly improving localization robustness under low-SNR conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that MSCAR-Net achieves a stable localization error of approximately 7.9 m at SNR ≥ −5 dB, representing an 87% improvement over the baseline CNN and a 44% enhancement compared with the LSTM-FCNN. Field validation using known perforation locations in the S-H2 hydraulic fracturing project confirms an average error of 8.2 m, while real-time localization of 65 events further validates the method’s applicability as a measurement solution for low-SNR MS monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate localization of the annihilation gamma-ray photon interaction points within detector crystals is critical for achieving high spatial resolution in positron emission tomography (PET). PET systems have achieved sub-millimeter resolution by employing pixelated detector blocks with small crystal size of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 1 \\times 1 ~\\text{mm}^{2}$</tex> in cross-section. While effective, this approach becomes expensive and technically complex when scaling to larger systems. Semi-monolithic crystal detectors offer a promising compromise by reducing readout complexity while maintaining high resolution through signal-based position estimation. In this study, we present an in-silico evaluation of two neural network architectures for estimating the monolithic and depth-of-interaction (DOI) coordinates in a semi-monolithic LYSO detector block, the building component of the Ultra-High Performance Brain PET (UHB-PET) system. The dataset was generated using GATE v8.0 simulations. We implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using 8 SiPM row-sum features (mimicking the realistic readout architecture), achieving resolutions of 0.45 and 0.59 mm in the monolithic and DOI directions, respectively. To improve accuracy near crystal edges, where MLP performance degrades, we developed an attention-augmented 1D CNN (A1D-CNN) using the full <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8+8$</tex> summed SiPM signals projected along the monolithic and axial directions readout values. This model outputs probability distributions over spatial bins and computes estimates via expectation, achieving a 40 % reduction in the spatial variance of the prediction coordinates error. While the models perform well under ideal conditions, the lack of electronic noise and perfect ground truth limits generalizability. Future work will focus on evaluating the performance of this approach using experimental data, with the ultimate goal of achieving sub-millimeter resolution in UHB-PET system."

    "abstract": "A full-ring CZT-based single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the current state-of-the-art for SPECT imaging. This modern clinical SPECT (e.g., StarGuide, GE HealthCare) is offered as SPECT/CT with 12 small rectangular CZT detector modules, allowing multiple degrees of freedom to focus and contour the imaging object. While this advance is a significant improvement from conventional NaI-based systems, there is a fundamental challenge to completely take over all applications of SPECT, i.e., lack of high energy photon imaging capability required for imaging radionuclides with high-energy photon emissions (e.g., <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{131} \\mathrm{I}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{225} \\text{Ac}$</tex>). This deficiency comes from the fact that it is not easily feasible to change collimators between scans. As a close academic-industry collaborative research effort, we have evaluated strategies to overcome this challenge by redesigning collimator geometries using validated Monte Carlo simulation tools and advanced image reconstructions. The validation step for the Monte Carlo simulation was performed using experimental data. First, we performed a NEMA body phantom scans with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{177} \\text{Lu}$</tex>, and confirmed the imaging performance for both the low (113 keV) and high energy (208 keV) peaks of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{177} \\text{Lu}$</tex> by both simulation and experimental data. Then, we tested if the current configuration of the collimator and detector shielding was able to image <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{131} \\mathrm{I}$</tex> (364 keV) and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{213} \\text{Bi}$</tex> of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{225} \\text{Ac}$</tex> decay (440 keV), which showed expected artifacts from septal and shielding penetrations. Using the validated simulation tool, we also designed a high-energy collimator that can offer the imaging capability for these radionuclides (i.e., <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{131} \\mathrm{I}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{225} \\text{Ac}$</tex>) assuming that there is a mechanism to adopt a second set of collimators for the imaging system.

While conventional partial volume correction (PVC) methods such as the Region-Based Voxel-wise (RBV) approach rely on structural MRI for anatomical segmentation, MRI-based correction is not always feasible due to issues of availability, misregistration, and variable image quality. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes high-resolution MRI from 18F-FDG PET and CT using a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). This synthetic MRI enables reliable segmentation and subsequent RBV-PVC. We further compare this approach with a direct PVC pipeline that predicts corrected PET images directly from PET/CT without using MRI. Our results demonstrate that the MRI-synthesis-aided approach provides improved quantification accuracy and interpretability compared to direct PVC methods."

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity and diversity of application scenarios in big data environments, database queries are increasingly characterized by hybrid query characteristics, such as multi-table joins, multi-condition filtering, and multi-dimensional operations. These queries rely on accurate cost estimation to assist optimizers in selecting efficient execution plans. However, existing cost estimation methods mainly depend on static statistical information, have limited feature representation capabilities, and struggle to adapt to high-dimensional, heterogeneous hybrid queries, resulting in significant estimation errors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hybrid query cost estimation framework based on QueryFormer. The framework enhances feature representation through flexible histogram partitioning and adaptive sampling strategies, and introduces a distance-driven compression mechanism that maps high-dimensional feature vectors into scalar distance representations, enabling efficient modeling while preserving feature identifiability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and generalization of cost estimation in both scalar and vector queries, achieving lower Q-error. These findings validate the effectiveness and practicality of the framework in complex hybrid query scenarios."

These issues stem from environmental disturbances, variable wall friction, and dynamic load changes. Accordingly, a mechanical model of the robot was developed in a wall-surface coordinate system based on its structural characteristics and operational state. A thorough analysis of the critical conditions for slip prevention, anti-overturning, and required motor torque was also conducted. To improve the system's dynamic performance, a dual-closed-loop attitude controller integrating Fuzzy Control Theory with a conventional PID controller was proposed. The controller features an outer loop that employs a Fuzzy PID for adaptive yaw angle regulation and an inner loop that utilizes a conventional PID for speed control. The efficacy of the proposed controller was validated and benchmarked against a traditional PID controller through Simulink simulations and prototype experiments. The results show the Fuzzy PID control system achieves superior attitude tracking accuracy and response speed, significantly enhancing the robot's overall performance."

The algorithm effectively improves the randomness and security of the output sequence by introducing dynamic parameter perturbation mechanism and periodic entropy injection strategy. Experimental results show that the designed pseudo-random number generator has low autocorrelation and inter-correlation, and the output of the system does not show significant statistical deviation, with the Lyapunov Exponent (LE) index reaching 17.42, which indicates that the generator possesses good uniformity, high entropy characteristics, strong chaos and high initial value sensitivity, and can effectively circumvent the problems of periodicity and predictability. The algorithm generates sequence Shannon entropy values of up to 7.9982 bits/byte, demonstrating resistance to typical cryptographic attacks such as brute force cracking, differential attacks, and periodic analysis. This method is suitable for security-sensitive scenarios such as key generation and encryption algorithms."

Manual interpretation of these radiographs is time-consuming and subject to variability. We propose a deep learning pipeline for automated multiclass semantic segmentation of postoperative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs. Our pipeline involved manual annotation of 740 radiographs, systematic preprocessing, and data augmentation. We implemented and compared four U-Net based architectures: Basic U-Net, Residual U-Net, EfficientNet-UNet, and Attention U-Net, to assess their performance across 17 anatomical and prosthetic structures. Although Residual U-Net achieved the highest mean global Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC= 0.865), all models demonstrated comparable performance. Our class-wise analysis identified persistent segmentation challenges in small, thin, or infrequent structures, such as osteosynthesis hardware. The results confirm the feasibility of deep learningbased segmentation as a foundational step toward automated radiographic assessment in postoperative THA imaging. This work lays the groundwork for future automated morphometric analysis, which could improve clinical efficiency and standardize postoperative follow-up care."

While a full pool of 256 individual channel classifiers initially showed suboptimal performance, refining the approach by selecting only the 10 best-performing individual classifiers per subject yielded substantial accuracy improvements of over 20%. This curated selection consistently outperformed FBCSP and, for some subjects, even mRMR.

    "abstract": "the rapid advancement of quantum computing introduces substantial risks to classical cryptographic algorithms that rely on number-theoretic problems, such as the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithm and elliptic curve cryptography. These cryptographic primitives are susceptible to polynomial-time quantum algorithms like those proposed by Shor and Grover, thereby endangering the security of contemporary digital infrastructures. In light of these emerging threats, the global cryptographic community is prioritizing the development and deployment of quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques. These include diverse algorithmic families such as those based on lattices, hash functions, error-correcting codes, and multivariate polynomials. Each approach exhibits distinct trade-offs in terms of computational performance, key length, signature size, and long-term resilience. This paper introduces a hybrid cryptographic framework optimized for specific application domains, particularly those with limited computational and energy resources. The proposed architecture strategically combines lattice-based encryption, hash-based digital signatures, and code-based key encapsulation mechanisms to form a unified model for secure data transmission. The architecture is implemented and evaluated across heterogeneous computing environments, including low-power embedded systems and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays. Experimental metrics such as execution latency, computational overhead, memory consumption, and energy efficiency are assessed and benchmarked against traditional single-algorithm deployments. The findings demonstrate that the hybrid approach maintains strong quantum resistance while significantly reducing performance penalties, making it suitable for mobile platforms, Internet of Things environments, and real-time communication systems. Future work should emphasize further fine-tuning for specific industrial domains, standardization of hybrid cryptographic protocols, and integration with artificial intelligence-based adaptive security layers to ensure sustainability in the approaching quantum era."

The model introduces two key innovations: (1) a cross-attention fusion module to dynamically align and combine tri-modal features while preserving temporal coherence, and (2) a cascaded temporal-spatial attention mechanism in the encoder to capture global contextual dependencies. Performance evaluations show that the proposed method can outperform its counterparts in terms of recognition accuracy under various SNR."

    "abstract": "The authors present an algorithm for classifying Uzbek-language documents in key public sector domains, including economics, legal texts, healthcare, housing and utilities, and energy. The study compares three established linear baselines—multinomial naive Bayes, logistic regression, and linear SVM—within a fixed, source-agnostic evaluation protocol. Texts are collected from government agencies and media outlets, cleaned of template text, normalized for spelling variants and apostrophes, and vectorized using TF-IDF at the word and character levels, including a hybrid representation. A cross-domain analysis reveals systematic confusions between the housing and utilities and energy categories, as well as between the legal and economic sectors, reflecting shared tariff narratives, outage/maintenance reporting, and regulatory language embedded in economic indicators. Error analysis also shows that character n-grams and script normalization are critical for robustness in agglutinative, mixed-orthography environments. In addition, the article also contains necessary information on the Uzbek language, its nature and features that must be taken into account when developing such tools."

Existing approaches typically rely on either purely CNN-based or Transformer-based architec-tures, yet they often face limitations in balancing accuracy and com-putational cost.To address this issue,we propose a CNN-Transformer Hybrid Denoising Network (CTHDNet) within a symmetric en-coder-decoder framework.In our design, the encoder adopts large-kernel convolutions to effectively capture local structures and con-textual features, while the decoder integrates a Transformer-based module together with a Convolution Refine Module (CRModule) to progressively upsample and refine the feature representations. This hybrid architecture preserves the inductive bias of CNNs while ex-ploiting the global modeling capability of Transformers. Extensive experiments on multiple infrared image benchmarks demonstrate that CTHDNet achieves superior denoising performance with favorable efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods."

This study proposes a novel framework for developing cyber resilience metrics tailored to AI-augmented threat intelligence platforms. Drawing on empirical data from 150 U.S. organizations in critical infrastructure sectors, the research introduces advanced metrics—AI-Assisted Detection Accuracy (AADA), Threat Intelligence Correlation Efficiency (TICE), and Adaptive Response Time (ART). Results show that organizations leveraging these enhanced metrics experience a 73% reduction in detection time and a 45% improvement in recovery speed compared to those using conventional systems. This work lays the foundation for new industry standards that more accurately capture the capabilities of AI-enabled cybersecurity solutions."

The proposed samples demonstrate the efficiency of the modification process of both the wood filler and the polymer matrix. The advantage of the proposed WPC samples with a modified wood filler compared to industrial samples ranges from 100% depending on the type of industrial WPC and the type of the proposed sample. The efficiency of simultaneous modification of both the wood filler and the polymer matrix of WPC samples based on a matrix in the form of secondary polyethylene (25 and 90 wt. %) and thermoplastic polyurethane (10 wt. %) was also established. The advantage of synergistic modification over the modification of any individual component of the wood-polymer composite is more than five times. From the results of the study of the influence of the modification of the DPC on the level of resistance to external conditions and the level of the dielectric loss tangent tg δ, it is clearly seen that the effective binding of free water in the DPC allows to increase the complex of dielectric characteristics."

However, the fact that CUDA supports only NVIDIA GPUs causes resource problems and additional costs for the user. In this article, a real-time face recognition system was developed. The system was built based on a lightweight CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model and was trained on image samples of 160×160 pixels. When the model training process was performed on a device without an NVIDIA GPU, speed problems were eliminated using OpenCL (Open Computing Language). The CNN model training process built for face recognition was accelerated on GPU using OpenCL. The training speed, accuracy, and real-time face recognition performance were compared on CPU (Central Processing Unit), a regular GPU, and a GPU optimized with OpenCL based on FPS (frames per second) and latency (ms). According to the experimental results, the optimization performed on the GPU using OpenCL significantly increased the model’s performance to 17 FPS. This is a more effective result than the CPU (4 FPS) and GPU (9 FPS) benchmarks. The proposed approach allows for stable and fast face recognition even on devices with limited resources."

Using the state-space method, a nonlinear model of the converter was developed and linearized, allowing to obtain a transfer function suitable for frequency-domain analysis. The main focus of the work is on the influence of component parameter variations (inductance, capacitance, equivalent series resistance) and parasitic losses on the system’s frequency response and stability. The study found that deviations in inductor and capacitor values significantly affect the shape of the amplitude and phase characteristics, while parasitic resistances, often regarded as negative factors, can in fact improve stability margins of the system. The study highlights the existence of a design trade-off between energy efficiency, which requires higher inductance values, and dynamic robustness, which deteriorates under the same conditions. The conclusions were confirmed by simulation modeling in MATLAB Simulink, which verified the analytical trends obtained. Recommendations were formulated for developing reliable feedback control strategies that ensure stable operation of switching capacitor converters under real-world component tolerances in server power supplies."

Under natural conditions, hydrates can form in gas and oil fields under certain thermobaric conditions. These deposits are in a metastable state. At insignificant change of thermobaric conditions their dissociation occurs. This may be one of the causes of technogenic accidents in the process of drilling production boreholes. Mathematical modelling allows to analyze the behavior of physical systems, as well as to obtain a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the process of hydrate decomposition in a permeable formation. For this purpose, phenomenological models using homogenized physical parameters are applied. In this paper, we propose a numerical method for mathematical modelling the process of methane hydrate dissociation in hydrate-saturated reservoir. We take in account an information of homogenized physical properties of sedimentary rock using laboratory measurements and results of X-ray microtomography of cores."

Feature selection plays a crucial role here as ransomware datasets are considered high-dimensional data. The dataset utilized is the RISS Ransomware Dataset, comprising 1,525 instances and 30,966 features, with the target variable categorized into two classes: ransomware or goodware. Experimental results indicate that Gradient Boosting with Chi-Square outperforms other models, including algorithms proposed by different researchers (such as SVM and CNN-based algorithms), achieving an accuracy of 97.51% with the use of only 250 features.

In this paper, we propose an automatic trajectory planning method for radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors based on the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). First, integrated and comprehensive clinical constraints are considered. The skin feasible domain is solved based on hard constraints, while the ablation trajectory is evaluated according to soft constraints. Then, to raise the diversity of solutions, NSGA-III is improved by introducing an adaptive differential evolution operator. Meanwhile, the TOPSIS method is utilized to automatically select the optimal trajectory from the Pareto solution set. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves complete tumor coverage and 45.53% ablation efficiency, and the automatically determined optimal trajectories are clinically safer and more effective."

Firstly, in the initialization stage of the population, Latin hypercube sampling is used to obtain candidate solutions with stronger dispersion; Secondly, introducing adaptive t-distribution mutation and trigonometric random walk in the third defense stage and after the third defense stage of the algorithm can effectively escape local optima and improve convergence accuracy; Finally, dynamic reverse elite learning is introduced in the later stages of iteration to avoid local optima caused by population reduction and accelerate global convergence. Through comparative experiments using 20 benchmark test functions, the results show that the improved algorithm has better optimization performance."

These low-resistance-grounded systems are designed to limit ground-fault current to a range between 100 A and 1000 A, with 400 A being typical. One of the main purposes of using low-resistance grounding is to limit ground-fault currents to hundreds of amperes, instead of thousands of amperes. The damage to the equipment connected to the system, particularly rotating machines, is limited by reducing the ground-fault current. Since the damage caused by ground-fault currents increases with the magnitude of the current, it is desirable to limit the ground-fault current to a value as small as possible without compromising the ability of protective devices to detect the fault and without exposing the system to dangerous overvoltages. This paper presents a procedure to determine the optimum size of the neutral-grounding resistor (NGR) in medium-voltage systems commonly found in industrial plants and electrical-distribution systems."

Linearization provides a practical approach for approximate solutions, particularly in seismic and acoustic inverse problems, where exact solutions are often unattainable due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. However, when a priori information on the medium’s velocity distribution is available, an approximate solution with controlled accuracy becomes feasible. This paper presents the formulation of the inverse kinematic problem and derives the corresponding inversion formula for vertically inhomogeneous media, under the assumption that the velocity function allows linearization near a constant background. The method employs refracted and scattered acoustic waves as the probing signal. The developed algorithm, implemented in Python, is used in model numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that the linearized solution agrees well with the exact one under appropriate conditions, and support the continuation of this research direction."

    "abstract": "Face forgery has given rise to a series of increasingly prominent problems, including personal privacy leakage, face-based payment security and visual communication security. Consequently, face forgery detection has emerged as a crucial task in the realm of information security. Nevertheless, existing face forgery detection methods often prove ineffective when dealing with complex image scene tasks, primarily due to implicit identity interference. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel scheme for face forgery detection. Especially, we introduce a novel Dual-Stream, Dual-Attention, and Dual-Feature network (3D-SAF). This framework initially establishes a Dual-Stream enhanced Simplified Linear Cross-Attention (DSLCA) network for shallow feature extraction, designed to selectively concentrate the network's attention on the low-level features of genuine faces. Building upon this foundation, we further develop a Dual-Stream enhanced Multiple Cross-Attention (DSMCA) network for deep feature extraction, which guides the network's focus towards the high-level features of forged faces. Ultimately, the integration of shallow and deep features facilitates effective face forgery detection. The detection accuracy on the C23 and C40 subsets of FaceForensics++ reaches 99.62% and 97.50% respectively, outperforming the optimal model in the mainstream by 2.74% and 8.58%. In the cross - database experiments, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of this model reaches 83.81%, surpassing that of the optimal mainstream model by 0.95%.

The evaluation process is designed to comprehensively assess the historical performance of the worker, the test scale, the test performance and the risk factors. The experimental results demonstrate that this method exhibits enhanced reliability in the evaluation of worker precision, as evidenced by its superior performance in comparison to alternative approaches."

    "abstract": "This study explores the barriers and enablers influencing the adoption of AI-driven home cooking machines among urban households, a domain that remains underexamined in technology adoption research. Specifically, the research aims to identify, rank, and compare barriers and enabling factors for AI-driven home cooking machine adoption among urban households, across gender and self-cooking preference segments. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire from 129 urban respondents, primarily aged 36–45, with 57.4% identifying as female and 77.5% married. Kendall’s W was used to assess consensus in rankings. Quantitative results show that ‘cost and affordability’ (Mean Rank = 1.19) and ‘convenience and time savings’ (Mean Rank = 1.83) are the most significant barrier and enabler, respectively. Significant subgroup differences were observed in the study, confirming the influence of user profiles on adoption preferences. The study is limited by its use of non-probabilistic sampling and reliance on self-reported preferences. The findings contribute to both theory and practice by emphasizing the importance of contextual and behavioral segmentation for the successful deployment of domestic AI technologies."

    "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have been applied to PET image denoising. Due to the large number of sampling steps and the inherent randomness of the sampling process, DPMs typically suffer from slow training and inference, as well as variability in results. In this study, we propose a restoration model based on a diffusion transformer, which combines the global distribution modeling capability of transformers with the local detail recovery ability of a decoder based on a convolutional neural network. Our model is trained on a multi-tracer, multi-scanner brain PET and MR dataset comprising 150 subjects with FDG, tau, and amyloid PET images acquired from two different scanners (Siemens Biograph and Siemens HRRT). We demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust denoising performance compared to standard DPMs. Furthermore, our model requires only 10 diffusion steps to produce high-quality denoised images, in contrast to the hundreds needed by standard DPMs. These results indicate that our method is promising as a robust and efficient PET denoising approach."

However, respiratory motion compromises the accuracy of CT-based attenuation correction, while concerns about radiation dose from repeated CT during rest and stress scans, along with the lack of integrated CT in some organ-specific PET scanners, limit its feasibility. To address these limitations, we developed a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate synthetic CT images directly from non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET data, enabling consistent attenuation correction without reliance on external anatomical imaging. The model was trained using paired Rb-82 myocardial perfusion PET scans and CT-derived attenuation maps. Quantitative evaluations showed that 3D DDPM outperformed both 2D DDPM and 3D UNet models in CT image synthesis. Error analysis of PET images reconstructed using different AC methods demonstrated that 3D DDPM achieved the lowest standard deviation among all methods. Notably, the synthetic CT images exhibited improved anatomical alignment with PET respiratory phases, which can reduce misregistration artifacts and potentially enhance PET quantification accuracy."

The simulation methods and algorithms are transparent, and the underlying code is being published as a part of the opensource package. RadSim includes a source generation module with the capability to output relative abundances of radionuclides at a given time along with a list of emissions from the sources with their energies and intensities. For the transport module, RadSim includes APIs to interface with deterministic and stochastic transport tools for transporting the radiation from the source to the surface of the detector. Finally, RadSim provides a newly engineered detector response module to model a detector and output a measured spectrum from an incident flux. The detector response tool includes modules to both estimate the gamma-ray interactions within the detector material and the effects of subsequent readout that impact resolution and pile-up. The detector response module includes a novel machine-learning approach to accurately obtain the chord length distributions of gamma rays traversing the detector. The full RadSim package with the detector modeling capability is scheduled for a full release in September 2025."

    "abstract": "In large-scale nuclear and particle physics experiments, high-precision time measurement is one of the important tasks. Combining amplification and discrimination with Time-to-Digital Conversion is a mainstream technical route of high-precision time measurement, while TDC is a key part. This paper presents a design of a multi-channel TDC Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) with high precision and large dynamic range. The design employs a coarse-fine measurement architecture: a two-dimension vernier structure is implemented for fine time measurement, while a coarse counter is utilized to extend the dynamic range. The twodimension vernier structure employs a 2D array of time comparators. By detecting signal timing across multiple nodes on the two delay lines, this structure enables a significant reduction of propagation delay line length while maintaining equivalent time quantization range, effectively decreasing propagation jitter and improving timing precision. To achieve a broad dynamic range, a coarse counter is utilized. However, for a specific high-frequency clock, the bit-width of the coarse counter is constrained. Conventional cascaded structures are prone to the metastability issue. To address this issue, this design adopts a cascaded gray code counter with a falling-edgetriggered parity bit combined with stage-by-stage calibration, effectively eliminating metastability. The ASIC is fabricated under a 180 nm CMOS process; the experimental results from multichannel testing demonstrate a timing precision better than 7 ps and a dynamic range exceeding 5 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mu \\mathrm{s}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "Nondestructive assay measurements in the context of nuclear safeguards aim to estimate the parameters that characterize neutron multiplication in an interrogated system. Typical devices utilized in these assays consist of arrays of He-3 proportional counters inserted in a polyethylene lattice for neutron moderation. This process significantly increases the neutron mean lifetime against detection due to scattering in the detector, and thereby, it obstructs the measurement of the multiplying system time characteristics. Recently, it has been demonstrated that this issue may be overcome through the development of scatter-based detector arrays, which are sensitive to fast neutrons and do not require thermalization. This paper outlines the development of a new scatter-based neutron multiplicity counter composed of stilbene crystals and presents early results of the study. Data post-processing algorithms were developed in order to generate the neutron detection timeline using pulse shape discrimination. Physical parameters related to multiplication are inferred from the timeline analysis using the Feynman-alpha method. We produced a first Feynman-Y curve from a simple measurement of a Cf-252 source, alongside an MCNP model of the setup that accounted for the said measurement, showing a 33 % mean deviation between the two curves. Approximations in the modeling of the detection efficiency, which translates into a deviation of the simulated convergence value (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\square^{\\infty}$</tex>), properly explain this discrepancy. In addition, the simulation consistently replicated the experimental neutron prompt decay constant (◻). We could therefore validate the simulation model and its associated algorithms, which will be used to dimension the final multiplicity-counting device. The detector performance parameters, such as the false neutron-counting rate, will also be studied in a near future."

The most common hardware used are Nvidia Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), and the language for writing highly optimised kernels is Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) that is mature but proprietary. This restricts deployment primarily to Nvidia hardware. This Hackathon project aimed to investigate the viability of Triton as an alternative, focusing on implementing the computationally expensive Joseph projector in Triton. This was written within a day and in less than 500 lines of code; this demonstrates the productivity that is enabled by Triton's Python-based meta-programming interface, block-based programming model, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation capabilities. Further to this, the advantages of programming with Triton are: (1) mixed precision, (2) support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, (3) Triton's internal code optimisation, and (4) autotuning of block sizes to maximally utilise the GPU. The Triton-based Joseph projector revealed comparable performance as compared to ParallelProj, an open-source Joseph Projector written in CUDA.

    "abstract": "X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT) using high atomic number element-based agents holds significant potential for tumor-specific imaging, yet its sensitivity remains a limitation in biomedical applications. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dual-domain reconstruction framework that synergizes a diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) model in the projection domain with a hybrid DPS and maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) approach in the image domain. In our method, projection noise is first suppressed using a diffusion model, after which DPS and MLEM reconstruction algorithms are alternately applied in the image domain to simultaneously enforce image priors and satisfy physical constraints of the imaging system. We validate the method on phantom experiments with gadolinium contrast: the proposed approach increases the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of reconstructed Gadolinium (Gd) images compared to conventional reconstruction, enabling a minimum detectable Gd concentration below 0.1 mg/ml. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo imaging of gadoliniumbased nanoparticles in a mouse of orthotopic liver tumors under a sparse view scan. The dualdomain iterative framework successfully recovers the Gd signal while simultaneously reducing noise. These results indicate that the proposed method advances XFCT's capability for highsensitivity imaging, broadening its applicability in precise tumor imaging and nanomedicine."

Recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in PET denoising, but existing approaches are computationally intensive and often require simulating lengthy stochastic processes. In this work, We propose a 3D flow-matching denoising model for total-body PET, trained to learn a continuous velocity field that maps noisy to clean images without simulating stochastic processes. To further improve efficiency, we introduce Self-Conditioned Starting (SCS), which initiates denoising from a partially noised low-dose input, preserving anatomical structure while refining details. We train and evaluate the model on the public Total-Body Ultra-Low-Dose PET Challenge dataset (1/10-dose) and compare against a conventional flow-matching model. Quantitative results show that our SCS approach achieves superior performance (PSNR: 43.87 ± 2.02 dB; SSIM: 0.99 ± 0.01) compared to full-step flow matching model. Our findings demonstrate that combining flow matching with self-conditioned starting enables faster 3D denoising in ultra-low-dose PET image restoration."

    "abstract": "Single cell imaging is strongly required to study the properties and mechanisms of cells for the realization of regenerative medicines. Therefore, development of dynamic micro imaging techniques based on nuclear medicine is desired. On the other hand, conventional nuclear medicine imaging techniques are not suitable for cell regulation studies. For example, PET imaging cannot achieve spatial resolutions smaller than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>. Autoradiography cannot obtain dynamic images. Therefore, we are developing a new micro radioisotope (RI) cell imaging system to realize dynamic cell observations. This system consists of a CCD camera and a plate eutectic scintillator which has a micro fiber structure smaller than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>. Compared to previous imaging systems, an important feature of the new system is the ability of the eutectic scintillator to improve imaging resolution by suppressing the scintillation photon spread due to the micro fiber structure."

To enhance the efficiency of charge collection, a single-junction double-sided 3D trench electrode detector (SJ-DS-3D-TED) is proposed in this work, which has been fabricated on the 8 -inch Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process platform of the Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS). We use deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and in-situ doping on the front side of the P -type substrate wafer to fabricate N -type trench electrodes. On the back side, P -type doping is carried out by using in-situ doping. Finally, we use metal magnetron sputtering deposition to achieve the connection of double-sided electrodes. The electrodes are added to both the front and back of the silicon wafer, which is equivalent to the entire silicon wafer (725 μm) being within the detection range of the detector. This device is expected to be widely applied in aerospace, nuclear medicine, large-scale scientific facilities, and X-ray spectrometers."

    "abstract": "Reflectance inversion is a critical challenge in quantitative hyperspectral remote sensing, especially in rugged terrain. The under-/over-correction of reflectance caused by such terrain and its impacts on subsequent information extraction have not been well quantified or effectively eliminated. To improve surface spectral reflectance inversion under varying illumination, atmospheric, and terrain conditions, an integrated correction method for geometric, atmospheric, and terrain effects (ICGAT) is proposed. The method incorporates a coupled radiative transfer model that accounts for direct solar irradiance, diffuse sky irradiance, surface-atmosphere coupling irradiance, and irradiance from neighboring slope along the sun-terrain-target path. The geometric positioning and irradiance components are first computed, and followed by an iterative retrieval of reflectance, geometric resampling is subsequently applied to the reflectance, an uncertainty quantification is finally conducted in the process. Tests show that ICGAT significantly improves spectral consistency between neighboring shaded and sunny slopes, reducing the influence of terrain relief on reflectance, as well as retrieve high-accuracy surface reflectance in flat areas. Meanwhile, the uncertainty propagation analysis could reveal not only the fidelity of the retrieved reflectance but also the major sources of uncertainty."

    "abstract": "FLASH radiotherapy is an emerging radiation therapy technique that delivers ultra-high dose rate irradiation (typically exceeding 40 Gy/s, far surpassing conventional radiotherapy's 0.03-0.1 Gy/s) to complete treatment in an extremely short time (on the millisecond scale). It utilizes high-energy radiation beams to deliver a high dose of radiation, rapidly damaging tumor cell DNA while minimizing normal tissue damage due to the extremely brief exposure time.X-ray FLASH radiotherapy stands out as one of the most clinically translatable FLASH technologies due to its deeper tissue penetration, broader equipment accessibility, flexibility in multi-field irradiation, and more established clinical translation foundation.To enhance the precision and safety of FLASH radiotherapy while reducing equipment cost and complexity, it is essential to develop high-speed, high-resolution, high-contrast imaging technologies with robust real-time tracking capabilities. During FLASH radiotherapy, high-energy X-rays induce strong acoustic signals in tissues, and by capturing these signals, high-precision images of target tissues can be reconstructed, optimized for FLASH radiotherapy applications. In this study, we employed Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations to model the interaction process of single-pulse 10 MV X-rays (generated by medical linear accelerators) with various materials. Subsequently, we used MATLAB's k-Wave toolkit to simulate the propagation and attenuation of the induced acoustic waves. The 128-element ring transducer array acquires acoustic signals, which are processed to reconstruct the target tissue image. Experimental results confirmed the feasibility of this online imaging technique for X-ray FLASH radiotherapy applications."

    "abstract": "Time-to-digital converters (TDCs) are a critical part of the acquisition chain to produce precise time measurements for radiation detection in medical imaging and high-energy physics. Research on TDC design in FPGA is often focused on digital means to improve resolution, precision and nonlinearity, such as using wave union or multiple delay lines. Less scrutiny is given to making sure that the tapped delay line (TDL) circuit itself is optimized through careful placement and routing. This study provides a model linking FPGA design parameters, namely, the delay through the TDL and clock skew to precision and nonlinearity. From this model, design principles are identified and used to produce four different circuit optimizations for the TDL. The effects of these optimizations on bin width and precision were studied both in simulation and measured experimentally on an UltraScale+ FPGA. These optimizations remove all ultrawide bins from the TDL. This led to an improvement of the RMS precision of a two-channel TDC from 4.7 ps to 2.5 ps. The produced model and simulator facilitate design choices and accelerate the optimization and validation of TDL-based TDCs."

    "abstract": "Active non-destructive nuclear measurement methods are essential in homeland security and safeguards, contraband detection, and other applications such as radioactive waste characterization and materials analysis. However, the current landscape reveals the lack of homogeneity and consistency in how techniques are described and terminology applied—often complicating, or even preventing, proper positioning within the state of the art. Photon- and neutron-based techniques differ not only in the type of irradiation performed, but also in the nuclear reactions they induce, the materials they target, the particles detected and their measurement, as well as the instrumentation involved in both the irradiation and detection steps. The absence of standardized terminologies, methods and procedures leads to inconsistent results, limited reproducibility, and poor comparability across laboratories, hindering scientific progress, regulatory acceptance, and international collaboration. To address these challenges, this work proposes the foundation of international standards in active non-destructive nuclear measurement methods, focusing on photon and neutron techniques. Drawing on a comprehensive review of both historical and recent developments led by key stakeholders, this initiative aims to define common and modern practices in active non-destructive nuclear measurement methods. Preliminary results from inter-laboratory comparisons and expert consultations are presented, highlighting key technical challenges and outlining a path toward an international consensus. Ultimately, this effort aims to enhance confidence, transparency, efficiency and comparability in active nuclear measurements across both conventional and nuclear industries, as well as within the global scientific and regulatory communities."

Furthermore, understanding the amount of bound Ac-225 versus free is vital to limit the dose to healthy tissue. In this presentation, we will introduce the concept of microfluidic alpha spectrometry. Here, the carrier fluid is placed in a continuous flow condition through small microfluidic structures that enable real-time alpha spectrometry for isotope identification and even concentration.

In this study, we aimed to propose a counting loss correction algorithm. The correction is performed by converting the measured “counting rate values” into those expected in ideal measurement conditions. Because the degree of the counting loss relates to the shape of the energy spectrum, our algorithm considers X-ray penetration in objects with various effective atomic numbers <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(\\mathrm{Z}_{\\text{eff }} \\mathrm{s}\\right)$</tex> and the detector response.

    "abstract": "RICH (Ring Imaging CHerenkov) detectors work by sensing single Cherenkov photons emitted by charged particles to measure their velocity. Due to the future need of increasing sensor granularity to avoid event pile-up, SiPMs (Silicon Photo-Multipliers) may replace vacuum-based PMTs (Photo Multiplier Tubes) as the baseline choice for next generation detectors. These sensors have, however, one downside, which is their high sensitivity to radiation, effect that can be counterbalanced by cooling the sensors down to cryogenic temperatures. To be sure that these sensors satisfy the requirements of future Cherenkov detectors in terms of signal gain, speed and time resolution, various SiPMs need to be characterized in a wide temperature range to find the best compromise between signal-to-noise ratio and cooling requirements. For this purpose, we designed a low-noise (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;1 \\text{nV} / \\sqrt{ } \\text{Hz}$</tex>), high-gain (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 7500 \\Omega$</tex>) and high-speed (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$700 \\text{MHz}-1 \\text{GHz}$</tex> closed-loop bandwidth) amplifier that can work in close proximity to the sensor during the entire characterization phase. The amplifier is made of two amplifying stages, the first is a HBT (Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor) whose collector node is connected to the positive input of a CFOA (Current Feedback Operational Amplifier), which has a local feedback forming a noninverting configuration. The whole system is then regulated with a resistor in a second feedback loop and is compensated for stability at the input node. The output is AC-coupled and can be either directly connected to an oscilloscope or to a second amplifying stage which operates at ambient temperature and has a gain of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.5 ~\\mathrm{V} / \\mathrm{V}$</tex> and 3 GHz bandwidth. This amplifier is being used by the LHCb RICH collaboration to characterize various SiPMs with different cell and pixel sizes, for use in the LHCb RICH Upgrade 2.

This setup produces forward-boosted charm baryons, which are then channelled through the crystal. By exploiting spin precession induced by the channelling effect in the bent crystal, ALADDIN aims to measure both the magnetic and electric dipole moments of charm baryons. The experimental apparatus consists of a 4.4 m -long spectrometer and a RICH detector for particle identification. It is designed for installation in the LHC Insertion Region 3 during Long Shutdown 3, requiring no civil engineering and having minimal impact on LHC operations, with data-taking planned for Run 4. A proof-of-principle test at the LHC, TWOCRYST, is currently underway to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. The experiment's Letter of Intent has been submitted to the LHCC, which has approved the collaboration to proceed with a technical proposal in 2025.

    "abstract": "Many modular PET sensors detect gamma photons using scintillation crystals that are segmented into small pixels by applying a Center of Gravity (CoG) algorithm to the signals output by the sensor module. Such methods reliably reconstruct the positions of scintillation events when optical photons are symmetrically distributed about the point of gamma photon interaction. However, when scintillation events occur at the periphery of the scintillation crystal array, the sensor module boundary prohibits optical photons from spreading out uniformly. This biases the calculated scintillation coordinates towards the center of the module, causing the scintillation pixel signatures on crystal flood maps to overlap with neighbouring pixels. Solutions have been proposed involving modifications to hardware components or coordinate reconstruction software. These include segmented light guides, a greater number of readout channels and modified CoG algorithms. Trials of such changes have been met with varying degrees of success, however little attention has been given to combinations of these methods on coordinate reconstruction accuracy. This research evaluates the coordinate reconstruction accuracy of sensor modules from a low-dose PET camera using single channel readout, a truncated CoG (TCoG) algorithm and a segmented light guide design. Crystal maps and peak profiles show that a combination of TCoG, single channel readout, and a partially segmented light guide produces the most accurate coordinate reconstruction."

In this article, we develop an extension in form of a text-event-parser to an established deep learning framework to interpret text-based system logbooks describing the metrological function of regulated measuring instruments, and compare the performance with a state-of-the-art approach. Results of implementing our proposed approach onto real-world devices reveal its ability to continuously monitor and identify regulated measuring instruments’ time-dependent behavior. The comparison study shows that our approach has an overall advantage, considering its performance and practical aspects such as required training costs. Additionally, we investigate combinations of the developed approach with other machine learning frameworks, including natural language processing and transfer learning, to evaluate and improve the overall scalability and robustness. Building on the results of the investigations, our approach facilitates the fully automatic quality control of modern software-driven measuring instruments."

    "abstract": "PET/MRI simultaneously provides functional and anatomical information, making it highly valuable for neuroscience research. To support non-human primate (NHP) neuroscience studies, a new MR-compatible PET insert, named SimPET-P, which is operable across a broad range of magnetic fields has been developed. In this study, we present initial performance and preliminary MR compatibility results of SimPET-P PET insert. Following the NEMA NU-4 2008 standard, spatial resolution, sensitivity, count rate performance and image quality phantom was evaluated. For image quality assessment, a micro hot rod phantom was scanned. All crystals in the detector block were clearly resolved in the flood map. The radial, tangential, and axial spatial resolutions at the center of the field of view based on 3D OSEM reconstruction were 1.24, 1.44, and 1.17 mm FWHM, respectively. The peak sensitivity was 5.86 % using an energy window of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$250-750 \\text{keV}$</tex>. The peak noise equivalent count rate (NECR) was 174.45 kcps at 9.73 MBq. Image uniformity was 5.03 %, and the spill-over ratios in water- and air-filled chambers were 0.07 and 0.17, respectively. In the hot rod phantom image, rods as small as 1.6 mm in diameter were distinguishable. For MR compatibility assessment, no distortion in the pulse shape or flood map was observed during operation of a gradient-echo (GRE) sequence. Furthermore, no significant distortion was observed in the MRI images with PET insert operation. These results demonstrate that the developed system can play a significant role in high-resolution PET/MRI studies for NHP. Further optimization of MR compatibility and integrated PET/MRI imaging studies are planned."

    "abstract": "Point Cloud Quality Assessment (PCQA) aims to accurately predict the visual quality of a point cloud, which is essential in optimizing and evaluating the point cloud compression, transmission and rendering. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based full reference PCQA using 3D-to-2D Regularized Representation (RegR-PCQA), where point clouds are projected to regularized 2D image representations and then measured with deep neural networks. Firstly, we propose a regularized representation module to project unstructured point clouds to 2D Regularized Geometry Images (RGIs) and Regularized Attribute Images (RAIs), which enhance the local adjacency and uniform distribution of points. An anchor matching is developed to build the correspondence of regularized images between the distorted and reference point clouds. Secondly, to exploit the visual features of the RGIs and RAIs, we propose a deep learning based two-branch PCQA network, in which vision transformer based Geometry Feature Extractor (GFE) extracts global structural features from RGIs and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Attribute Feature Extractor (AFE) extracts local semantic features of the RAIs. Finally, based on the geometry and attribute features, the point cloud quality is predicted by the proposed quality regression module, where a spatial attention mechanism is exploited to assign different importance weights for the feature maps. Experimental results show that the Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficients (PLCC) achieved by the proposed RegR-PCQA are 0.8430, 0.9575, 0.7853 and 0.8576, respectively, on the SIAT-PCQD, SJTU-PCQA, WPC and WPC2.0 datasets, which are superior to the state-of-the-art PCQAs. Also, extensive experimental results on distortion types, sampling strategy and training rate show that the proposed RegR-PCQA achieves an excellent generalization."

In this work, we present a novel front-end architecture based on a Charge Sensitive Amplifier with predictive gain switching, and a Flip-Capacitor filter. The CSA is designed to achieve both a single photon resolution and a high dynamic range up to 10000 photons by employing an active control of the gain. The predictive gain switching circuit dynamically sets the proper gain by adding feedback capacitances in parallel. The predictive gain switching is based on the time instant at which the signal exceeds a specified threshold. When the CSA is in its highest gain configuration, a filter is connected to reduce the electronic noise and achieve the single photon resolution at 1 keV. To couple the CSA with the filter, a voltage-tocurrent converter has been designed. The filter is based on an architecture called Flip-Capacitor Filter and implements a fast trapezoidal weighting function. The first prototype of this front-end has been designed in 65 nm CMOS technology, and has already been submitted. We expect to show the experimental results at the conference."

Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multistep ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based time–frequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multipath tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {\\mathrm {70~\\text {p}\\text {s} }}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, with median coherent gains above 99% using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario.

    "abstract": "Large artificial intelligence (AI) models for wireless communications have demonstrated remarkable success across a range of wireless downstream tasks. However, their high computational overhead, low training efficiency, and limited privacy protection pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained terminal devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed framework that utilizes a three-layer cooperative paradigm to effectively achieve cooperation among agents, namely Multi-agent cooperative Large AI Models for Wireless Communications: MaLAM4Com. However, two key challenges in MaLAM4Com are how to effectively extract knowledge from shared information and how to alleviate the significant complexity arising from high-dimensional information sharing. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce federated distillation and Lyapunov cooperation to achieve robust knowledge transfer and consistent dynamic evolution, enabling the agents to capture the intrinsic structure of wireless channels. Subsequently, we innovatively utilize low-dimensional embeddings to facilitate information sharing among agents, significantly reducing cooperation complexity by up to 94% while enhancing privacy protection. This breaks traditional cooperative paradigms that rely on wireless channels. Moreover, we further introduce dataset distillation to enhance training efficiency by synthesizing elite data instead of directly utilizing raw datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that MaLAM4Com significantly outperforms existing baselines, with gains exceeding 45% under low sampling ratios. Remarkably, low-dimensional embeddings have also shown significant advantages in downstream tasks, reducing inference complexity by over 96%."

    "abstract": "In cancer surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy to determine the presence of metastasis around the tumor has emerged as a critical technique in minimally invasive procedures. Although fluorescence-guided tumor resection is currently employed for this purpose, it has limitations, including a high local recurrence rate and difficulty in detecting deep-seated tumors. To address this, our research team is developing a gamma camera for robotic surgery capable of detecting deeply located metastatic lymph nodes. However, due to the structural constraint of the 12 mm diameter trocar used in surgical robots, it is difficult to incorporate lateral shielding components, making the system vulnerable to gamma rays entering from the sides and rear. To overcome this limitation, we previously proposed a shielding method based on a phoswich structure using BGO, which has a high stopping power, as a replacement for the conventional light guide. Building on this method, the present study investigates the effectiveness of BGO by comparing the shielding performance according to its thickness and shape, with the aim of identifying an optimal structural configuration. Three detector types were evaluated: the conventional cylindrical glass light guide design (C-Glass), and cylindrical and truncated cone-shaped BGO-based phoswich designs (C-BGO and T-BGO, respectively). Simulation results showed that the C-Glass detector was highly susceptible to lateral gamma radiation within the 90° to 170° angular range. In contrast, the BGO-based detector (C-BGO, T-BGO) rejected about 88% of the background gamma rays in the same range, demonstrating significantly improved shielding performance. Notably, the T-BGO exhibited slightly superior shielding capability compared to the C-BGO, and it was confirmed that a BGO thickness of at least 1.5T is required to achieve effective attenuation."

In this context, one of the major issues for the development of deep learning models for semantic segmentation is the lack of labeled data, which affects the training of neural architectures. In this study, we propose a semi-supervised learning method that leverages scribble annotations, including points, diagonal lines, and polygons, alongside pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. To ensure the reliability of pseudo-labels, we propose selecting them based on confidence and spatial proximity constraints. To validate our method, we performed extensive experiments on terrestrial and planetary datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing semi-supervised methods when trained on scribble annotations. In particular, the proposed method trained on diagonal scribbles yields the highest overall accuracy of 99.4% on the terrestrial dataset and 94.7% on the planetary dataset. These findings indicate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to those of the fully supervised methods trained on dense annotations, while significantly reducing labeling costs."

    "abstract": "In recent years, industrial chain cooperation has evolved into multiplex network structures where product agents are linked through diverse types of interdependencies. While such architectures enhance coordination flexibility, resource-sharing efficiency, and system-level resilience, they also introduce complex hybrid dynamics. These dynamics emerge from fluctuating task demands, continuous changes in network topology as agents join or leave, and variations in production capacities across agents. Their interactions generate cascading cross-layer effects that disrupt load balance and challenge conventional scheduling and resource management strategies. This work addresses the resulting complexity by proposing the hierarchical grouped task migration (HGTM) algorithm, which migrates tasks in groups rather than individually. Leveraging its hierarchical design, HGTM enables effective multilevel load balancing throughout the multiplex structure while keeping computational overhead low. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments show that HGTM enhances task completion rates, improves execution utility, and reduces completion costs. The approach exhibits strong robustness and adaptability, particularly under increasingly dynamic and highly coupled operating conditions."

However, optimizing agile locomotion while accounting for the varying energy costs of traversing different terrains remains an open challenge. Most previous work focuses on planning trajectories with traversability cost estimation based on human-labeled environmental features. This human-centric approach is insufficient because it does not account for the varying capabilities of the robot locomotion controllers over challenging terrains. To address this, we introduce a novel real-world learning pipeline that unifies offline demonstrations, online reinforcement learning, and multi-modal perception to achieve robust legged navigation. The framework employs multiple training stages to develop a planner that guides the robot in avoiding obstacles and hardto- traverse terrains while reaching its goals. We first develop a novel traversability estimator in a robot-centric manner. The training of the navigation planner is directly performed in the real world using a sample efficient reinforcement learning method. With the proposed method, a quadrupedal robot learns to perform traversability-aware navigation through realworld interactions in diverse offroad and unstructured environments. Moreover, the robot demonstrates the ability to generalize the learned navigation skills to unseen scenarios."

Traditional machine learning (ML) models for intrusion detection are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained Electric Vehicles (EVs). This paper presents a novel multi-stage framework that enables real-time intrusion detection through TinyML models. The proposed framework combines advanced feature selection (FS) using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values with hybrid pruning techniques to create efficient, deployment-ready models. Using the CICEVSE2024 dataset, the paper demonstrates significant improvements across multiple architectures: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieves 95.9% reduction in inference time and 80.7% reduction in model size while maintaining more than 94% accuracy; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) shows 69% reduction in inference time and 79.2% size reduction with more than 94% accuracy; and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) delivers 15.7% reduction in inference time and 91.2% reduction in size while preserving more than 98% accuracy. We further evaluate the models on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) and observe that although inference times increase on the resource-constrained device, the pruned models consistently maintain real-time performance, using the same models as on the desktop to ensure identical accuracies for a fair comparison. These results establish the feasibility of deploying TinyML-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) directly on EVs, enabling robust real-time cybersecurity without exceeding hardware constraints."

To fill this gap, this paper presents a pulse-switching characterization method for GaN-BIS that incorporates multi-mode testing under various DC bus voltages, including single-pulse (SP) mode, double-pulse (DP) mode, and multiple-pulse (MP) mode.

The coatings were deposited on AISI 304 stainless steel substrates, which are widely used as a structural material in nuclear power applications, using the galvanostatic electrolysis method. The synthesized coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results showed that increasing the concentration of aluminum nitrate in the electrolyte led to a noticeable increase in the size of surface cracks in the coatings. Specifically, when aluminum nitrate was introduced while sodium nitrate was excluded from the electrolyte, the crack size increased by a factor of 12.5. The addition of aluminum nitrate also reduced the average crystallite size within the coating by a factor of 3.5 to 7. Despite this reduction, the presence of large crystallites (600–800 nm) was observed across all examined samples. A specimen formed in an electrolyte containing 0.1 mol/L aluminum nitrate without sodium nitrate exhibited larger crystallites compared to one formed in an electrolyte with the same aluminum nitrate concentration but with added sodium nitrate. The crystallite sizes were 250 nm and 100 nm, respectively. Elemental analysis confirmed that all coating samples were composed of chromium and oxygen, with no detectable aluminum. Based on EDX point analysis, the likely chemical formulas of chromium oxides in various oxidation states were calculated and correlated with specific points on the coating surface. These findings indicate that the coatings predominantly consist of heat-resistant and hard chromium (III) oxide, along with contributions from chromium (IV) oxide and mixed-valence chromium (II,III) oxide."

    "abstract": "The increasing share of wind power generation in the energy system highlights the growing importance of ensuring the reliability of wind farm equipment. This equipment is particularly threatened by lightning overvoltages with a high front steepness. Traditional protection means based on surge arresters are not always effective in suppressing the high-frequency components of such pulses. This article investigates the effectiveness of using a Frequency-Dependent Device for protecting wind power facilities. Full-scale experiments were conducted on a specially developed setup generating short pulses that simulate the impact of lightning overvoltages. The methodology involved recording pulse parameters at the input and output of the Frequency-Dependent Device, followed by computer modeling in the MATLAB Simulink environment to verify the results and evaluate the device's active resistance. The results demonstrate the high effectiveness of the Frequency-Dependent Device in reducing the front steepness and amplitude of high-frequency pulses (with frequencies above 200 kHz), with the device’s efficiency increasing as the frequency of the impacting signal rises."

Firstly, the pseudo-partial derivative is used to estimate the height dynamic characteristics in real time. On this basis, the anti-interference parameter update mechanism and the control law with dynamic constraints are designed, and the tracking accuracy and input change are balanced by weight factors. In addition, the closed-loop stability and error convergence of the system at a constant desired height are proved. Simulation experiments verify the robust adaptability of the proposed scheme under network disturbance."

    "abstract": "Tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) represent a highly promising new generation of photovoltaic devices that have garnered extensive research in recent years. TPSCs offer advantages such as high theoretical limits, relatively simple fabrication processes, abundant raw material sources, and the potential for flexible device fabrication. However, their actual efficiency remains significantly below theoretical limits. To enhance the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE), optimization of the absorber layer material is essential, and improvements to the electron transport layer (ETL)—a critical functional layer—are also necessary. ETLs demand excellent electron extraction and transport capabilities. Fullerene-based materials possess exceptionally high electron mobility, favorable electron affinity, and outstanding thermal stability. Furthermore, they can be further optimized through chemical modification, making them highly promising ETL candidates. Here, we summarize the general properties of fullerene-based materials and compile recent reports on their application as ETLs in TPSCs, following with an analysis of current challenges and potential future development directions, as well as a conclusion."

Current data sharing among multiple media entities faces challenges including storage fragmentation, multi-source heterogeneous data integration, and small-file storage bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-source heterogeneous shared data storage framework specifically designed for multi-entity convergence. For the characteristic multi-source heterogeneity of shared data, we develop a multi-dimensional decision-making-based classification model to achieve adaptive storage optimization. To resolve small files storage performance bottlenecks, we implement small files consolidation combined with a metadata indexing method based on minimal perfect hashing. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework effectively enables cross-entity data sharing while improving memory utilization and reducing average read latency."

    "abstract": "Free-Space Optical Communication (FSOC) has gained significant attention in integrated air-ground networks due to its advantages, such as high bandwidth, low latency, and spectrum license-free operation. However, its link quality is highly susceptible to atmospheric turbulence, rain and fog attenuation, and pointing errors, leading to significant fluctuations and posing challenges for dynamic routing and power control. To enhance network robustness, this paper proposes an end-to-end Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-Fully Connected Neural Network (BiGRU-FCNN) prediction framework. The framework first employs Bidirectional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to capture the sequential dependencies in both the forward and backward directions. It then extracts local-global correlated features through multi-scale 1D convolutions in parallel. Additionally, the remaining power of the optical terminal is integrated, and the link is classified into Bad, Marginal, or Good levels via a fully connected layer. Compared to traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the average prediction accuracy is improved to $89 \\%$. The results indicate that the proposed framework provides stable and accurate link quality predictions, offering reliable decision-making support for real-time routing reconstruction and power adaptive control."

    "abstract": "Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar systems are often employed for parallel target detection across a wide operational sector. However, such modes inherently result in uniform spatial power distribution, which limits efficiency when operating with a priori information about the target’s direction. Additionally, there is active development of MIMO radars utilizing simple modulation schemes such as Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) and Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK), which significantly simplify radar architecture. This work proposes an extension of existing methods for angular-domain power distribution control in MIMO radars using Zadoff–Chu sequences, adapted for BPSK/QPSK-based MIMO radar systems, and develops a power distribution control algorithm accounting for constraints inherent to such systems. The paper presents the development stages, algorithm description, and results of its mathematical modeling. It is demonstrated that, for the considered BPSK/QPSK MIMO radar (16/32 Tx), an energy gain of approximately 2-5 dB can be achieved solely through the application of the proposed algorithm. This will increase the signal-to-noise ratio of signals during digital signal processing in operating modes with target direction information."

The current machine learning prediction methods for general-purpose cluster jobs still need to be improved in terms of prediction accuracy and practical application effect. In this paper, we innovatively propose a method combining cluster analysis and deep learning: firstly, we extract job type features by clustering historical job logs; then, we introduce the Transformer-Ekan model based on the attention mechanism, and select seven key dimensional features (based on the criteria of prediction relevance, data completeness and validity) to construct the prediction model. A time-series training strategy is adopted to process jobs hierarchically by continuous resources, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the temporal neural network model outperforms traditional machine learning methods and BP neural networks on different types of job datasets, effectively improving the cluster resource utilisation and job scheduling accuracy."

    "abstract": "In response to the challenges of significant dialectal acoustic diversity and the uneven distribution of low-resource data, which limit the model’s generalization ability in multi-dialect speech recognition, this paper proposes a Dialect-Adaptive Conformer, DA-Conformer. By introducing a conditional parameter generation mechanism and a multigranularity feature interaction strategy, the model achieves dialect adaptation at both local feature extraction and global dependency modeling levels, enabling effective dialectal acoustic modeling. Dialect embedding vectors are utilized to guide the generation of frequency-domain sensitive convolution kernels, enhancing the ability to extract dialect-specific local features such as tone and plosive sounds. Additionally, a learnable bias matrix is introduced to correct attention weight distributions, strengthening the modeling of tonal boundaries and continuous pitch variation regions. Experiments were conducted on the Nexdata Chinese-dialect dataset (2500 hours), covering multiple Chinese dialects, as well as a self-built multidialect set (ZDialect, 120 hours). The results show that the average word error rate (WER) of the DA-Conformer is 14.5% persent, which is a reduction of 33.2% and 20.8% compared to Conformer-Base and UniSpeech-SAT-D, respectively. Ablation experiments further reveal that the dynamic convolution module and dialect-conditioned attention contribute 17.9% and 9.9% of the WER improvement, respectively."

While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have been widely studied independently, their cooperative potential remains underexplored. This paper proposes a UAV–UGV collaborative operation framework designed for agricultural applications. The UAV employs the LeGO-LOAM algorithm to construct an environmental map and generates an optimal trajectory between task-defined start and end points using the A* algorithm. The planned path is converted into GPS waypoints and transmitted to the UGV via robot operating system distributed topic communication. The UGV then performs path tracking through a pure pursuit control strategy. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the Ackermann steering model is adopted to approximate vehicle kinematics. Results demonstrate that the integration of UAV-based aerial mapping with UGV-based ground execution enables accurate trajectory tracking and efficient task completion, highlighting the potential of UAV–UGV collaboration for advancing agricultural unmanned operations."

    "abstract": "Music recommendations have become an important part of everyday life. With the abundance of music available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable music content. To address this issue, recommendation systems have emerged as a solution to personalize song suggestions for users. Traditional recommendation systems often fail to capture sequential patterns of user interaction. To understand these patterns, recommendation systems are based on a sequential approach. However, traditional sequential recommendation system models do not sufficiently capture dependencies on long-term temporal patterns. In this study, we apply a combination of Graph Neural Network (GNN) with attention mechanisms to the Music4All dataset to address sequential music recommendations. This approach, which adapts the Graph-based Attentive Sequential model with Metadata (GASM), This model was applied for the first time to this music dataset, which has a wider diversity and distribution of users and can provide new insights into the effectiveness of this model. GNN capture the relationships between users and items, as well as between items themselves, while the attention mechanism captures user interest patterns over time within a session. We also incorporate long-term and dynamic preferences to enrich the context of user preferences. By applying this model to the Music4All dataset, the model can recommend the next music track with a Hit Ratio (HR) evaluation ranging from 32.69 to 49.16 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) ranging from 23.34 to 30.71. These results show that our approach can effectively capture sequential patterns in music in large-scale datasets."

    "abstract": "Gaze estimation faces significant challenges in adapting to diverse eye morphologies, viewing conditions, and individual variations. Existing methods typically apply feature extraction directly to raw images, often struggling with suboptimal input quality and inefficient feature organization for gaze-specific tasks. To address these limitations, we propose DAREGaze, a novel dual-stage optimization architecture that enhances gaze-relevant information at both image and feature levels. Our approach consists of two key components: STARE (Spatial Transformation with Adaptive Rectangular Enhancement), a front-end adaptive image enhancement module, and PRISM (Perceptual Refinement through Integrated Similarity Mapping), a back-end feature reorganization module. STARE employs attention-guided rectangular sampling to adaptively reconstruct features based on eye structure characteristics, functioning as a sophisticated feature reconstructor. PRISM introduces a high-similarity feature reorganization network that identifies and preserves only the most relevant feature connections through soft thresholding operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARE-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple cross-dataset tasks. Our method provides a new paradigm for gaze estimation through targeted optimization at different processing stages, offering both enhanced accuracy and improved adaptability to diverse scenarios."

The preprocessing stage includes traffic splitting, desensitization, cleansing, and multidimensional data vector generation. Improved encoding conversion and information gain-based dimensionality reduction methods are employed. For feature extraction, the LSTM model is optimized by combining IPSO, integrating local correlation and dynamic evolution characteristics, and introducing a correlation analysis module. Key vectors are input into the domain discrimination module, constructing a weighted composite loss function to address traffic class imbalance. A malicious traffic feature capture module is constructed, and finally, a detection mechanism is constructed using the captured patterns to achieve secure detection of malicious traffic in host terminal local area networks. Experimental results show that the designed method only increases the false alarm rate from $2.0 \\%$ to $4.0 \\%$, and can accurately distinguish between normal and malicious traffic. With the increase of malicious cache entries, the F1 score decreases minimally from 0.85 to 0.77, demonstrating its significant advantage in detection accuracy."

This study found that human facilitators still play a pivotal role beyond content delivery, serving as the link between technical proficiency and entrepreneurial problem-solving among students who learn technology entrepreneurship subjects. This study investigates the extent to which facilitator involvement mediates the relationship between active learning strategies (Project-based learning and Problem-based learning) and academic performance, while also accounting for the influence of students’ prior knowledge. Grounded in constructivist learning and scaffolding theories, the study analyzes survey data from undergraduate students at a private university in Indonesia using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results show that targeted facilitator support significantly enhances academic achievement and strengthens the indirect effects of project-based learning and problem-based learning on performance. Additionally, prior knowledge positively influences outcomes when paired with explicit instructional guidance. These findings underscore the importance of facilitator training and instructional design, and thus human-technology collaborations, that align active learning methods with students’ cognitive readiness, offering practical insights for improving technopreneurship education"

    "abstract": "The concept of anisotropic potentials for modeling elongated particles is a well-established approach in molecular dynamics. The Gay-Berne model, introduced in 1981, serves as a prime example. This model describes orientation-dependent interactions between ellipsoidal particles and has been widely utilized in liquid crystal simulations, demonstrating the efficacy of such potentials in self-organizing systems. However, this paper adapts the potential-particle paradigm to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm control, where traditional control algorithms often struggle with scalability, environmental adaptability, and collision avoidance. Emerging decentralized control algorithms address these issues by leveraging potentials. In this context, the design of potentials is driven by swarm behavioral requirements, enabling new design approaches. We propose a new method for designing anisotropic potentials that offers a simple and flexible approach. As a demonstration, we construct a simple elliptical potential. Simulations of a system consisting of seven elliptical particles reveal stable swarm formations, a steady decline in fluctuations, and robust collision avoidance, thus validating the method’s practical applicability."

Such testing is typically performed during the functional testing phase. The relevance of this work stems from the need to ensure that a software’s visual elements adhere to accessibility guidelines, including those for users with color vision deficiencies. We analyze the problem, propose a mathematical model for evaluating images against accessibility criteria, and present a methodology for automatic testing using computer vision libraries (OpenCV). We also report the results of testing a prototype tool designed to assess visual elements for color vision impairments. Finally, we discuss how these results can be integrated into continuous integration (CI) systems to automatically detect potential accessibility issues."

This work proposes CAMIL-A, a method that combines image-level attention maps with patch-level activation maps to identify regions within whole-slide images (WSIs) associated with clinical outcomes. The model uses deep representations extracted from patches selected based on high tissue content, which are processed through a multilayer perceptron trained with case-level survival labels. The attention weights identify the most relevant patches globally, while Grad-CAM highlights local features within each patch. By combining both signals, a weighted attention map is generated that emphasizes the most informative morphological regions. CAMIL-A achieved an F1-score of 0.857 and a concordance index (C-index) of 0.879, and its attention scores showed significant associations in a multivariate Cox regression analysis, providing a visual and quantitative tool to support clinical prognosis."

With 76% of Indonesian users following at least one influencer and 68% having purchased items based on influencer recommendations, the Indonesian market presents significant opportunities for effective influencer marketing strategies. This study employed Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks to analyze 1,000 influencer campaigns from 300 Indonesian food SMEs collected between 2023-2024. Feature engineering incorporated engagement metrics, content characteristics, timing variables, and economic factors to predict ROI, sales conversion rates, and brand awareness lift. Results demonstrate that XGBoost achieved 82% accuracy in ROI prediction, with micro influencers showing optimal performance for budgets under $500, achieving an average ROI of 312% compared to macro influencers. The analysis reveals a performance sweet spot at 50,000-100,000 followers for balanced reach and engagement, yielding 245% ROI. Content authenticity and food aesthetics emerged as the strongest predictors with feature importance scores of 0.31 and 0.28 respectively. This framework provides actionable insights for SME budget allocation and influencer selection strategies in the rapidly evolving Indonesian digital marketing landscape."

    "abstract": "Chagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, remains a global public health problem, with cases reported even outside its traditional endemic areas. Its primary clinical manifestation occurs at the cardiac level, characterized by the formation of amastigote nests. This work presents a deep learning algorithm for automatic detection of amastigote nests in cardiac histopathological images obtained from a murine model. For the nests’ detection, a YOLOv8-based architecture was trained on histological images performing a 5-fold cross-validation, while the final tests were carried out with data unseen by the YOLOv8 from four image groups of different post-infection days. In training stage, YOLOv8 achieved 97.9% in accuracy, 98.6±0.3% in precision, and 97.2±0.8% in recall, while in the final test, the best result identified was 78.6% in accuracy, 76.4% in precision, and 81.1% in recall on images at 100× magnification. These metrics reveal the model’s ability to generalize well and its high sensitivity to unseen data. The results of this study show that the proposed algorithm is capable of identifying amastigote nests, which may be useful in clinical areas to understand the damage caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection."

    "abstract": "Several IoT systems for hospital noise assessment have released sound data for analysis. However, the challenge is to label sounds manually, so an optimum self-supervised method for labeling is a research opportunity. This study aims to use spectral flatness to assess noise in IoT-based hospital environments by applying the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with a k-means clustering algorithm for unsupervised labeling. The process begins by collecting a hospital ambient noise dataset from Kaggle. The audio data undergoes preprocessing steps, including frame cropping, filtering, and normalization. Key spectral features—spectral flatness, Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are then extracted. PSO-K-means is subsequently applied to classify noise patterns based on their spectral characteristics. Finally, a system integration plan is developed to embed this method and conduct a hospital noise assessment. The use of PSO k-means with 100 particles and 40 iterations yielded three optimal metrics: RMSE, spectral flatness, and a cluster number of 3, along with a silhouette score of 0.54. This value is greater than the elbow method, which obtained the number of clusters of 6 and a silhouette score of 0.22 using five metrics. Through the chosen metrics and cluster numbers, we can analyze aspects of loudness, the presence of noise, and the differentiation of tone-like and noise-like sounds. The three clusters in the hospital’s ambient sound have very different characteristics, which leads to the conclusion that the hospital we assessed has noise levels above normal and requires special treatment."

Conventional video- and sensor-based systems face privacy, environmental, and usability constraints, motivating the use of WiFi sensing as a ubiquitous, robust, and cost-effective alternative. We present a lightweight deep learning model for WiFi-based gesture recognition that integrates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the InceptionTime framework. By jointly applying channel and spatial attention, CBAM enhances discriminative feature extraction with minimal overhead, while depthwise separable convolutions mitigate added complexity and reduce overfitting. Cosine annealing and L2 regularization further stabilize training and improve generalization. Evaluated on the ARIL dataset, the model achieves 97.12% accuracy while substantially lowering parameter count, training time, and inference latency. These results establish an efficient and robust approach to WiFi-based gesture recognition, offering strong potential for scalable deployment in smart environments."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) integration in higher education has shown promising potential, yet empirical findings on its actual contribution to student learning performance remain inconsistent. Most existing studies focus on comparing AI-supported and non-AI-supported instruction, while little attention has been given to variations within the same learning context. This study aims to analyze the impact of AI integration on student performance using a within-class meta-analytic design, with particular attention to the moderating role of AI usage duration. Data were collected from 135 undergraduate students enrolled in an Educational Technology program who experienced uniform AI-based instructional interventions. Statistical analyses included Welch’s ANOVA and linear regression to examine whether weekly AI usage hours predicted academic outcomes. Results indicated no significant differences in performance across AI usage groups (p > 0.05), and duration of use was not a significant predictor of final grades. However, descriptive findings revealed high engagement with AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Canva, primarily for summarizing readings, retrieving references, and answering content-related questions. These findings suggest that the quality of AI integration into learning design is more critical than the duration of usage. The study contributes to theory by highlighting the role of AI as cognitive support rather than performance determinant and provides practical implications for educators to focus on meaningful AI-based instructional design."

This paper presents a hybrid neural network model that integrates clinical diagnostic logic directly into its architecture to enhance explainability and accuracy. A formalized algorithm based on biosignals — such as electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and heart rate variability (HRV)—was developed to emulate expert decision-making. The algorithm was embedded into a Rule Injection Layer (RIL), enabling the network to combine expert knowledge with data-driven learning. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets demonstrate high diagnostic performance (up to 97.1% accuracy) and robustness under varying signal conditions. The model is optimized for deployment in low-power embedded systems, providing a reliable solution for non-invasive CVD monitoring with interpretable outputs. Explainability is further supported using the LIME framework, which highlights feature contributions for clinical validation."

Multifrequency excitation is a fundamental physical property of quartz resonators, arising from anisotropic elastic coupling. However, in the context of highly stable self-oscillatory systems used as reference frequency sources, this property is generally undesirable and often mitigated through design and manufacturing constraints. A critical review of existing mathematical models reveals that none can comprehensively describe the dynamics of piezoresonant systems subjected to vibrational destabilizing influences. To address this limitation, a new modeling approach is proposed, incorporating nonlinearities, environmental disturbances, and discrete boundary constraints. The model is validated through simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics and SolidWorks, using a piezoceramic disk mounted on four supports. Simulation results confirm the presence of multiple closely spaced resonant modes and demonstrate the sensitivity of system dynamics to mechanical stress and excitation conditions."

In this work, we leverage a pretrained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesize 3D mean diffusivity (MD) scalar maps from the Cam-Can dataset. To adapt the DiT model—originally trained on 2D natural images—for 3D neuroimaging data, we implemented a preprocessing strategy that tiles 2D slices from 3D volumes into composite 2D images, enabling effective finetuning. The quality of the generated synthetic images was evaluated using Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, demonstrating high fidelity and anatomical coherence. To assess the utility of synthetic data in downstream tasks, we conducted transfer learning experiments for dementia classification on the ADNI dataset. A sex classification model, trained on both real and synthetic Cam-Can data, was repurposed for this task, showing that synthetic samples can enhance model performance. These results highlight the potential of diffusion-based generative models for augmenting neuroimaging datasets and supporting clinical applications."

Common segmented detectors have dead space between crystals that reduces the detector's overall sensitivity. A solution to this issue involves the technique of subsurface laser engraving that creates optical barriers. In the context of the development of a high sensitivity quasi-spherical brain PET, this work presents the results of a flexible engraving method offering versatility in the exploration of non-conventional geometries. The method is optimized so that it completes a detector fabrication within a few hours. The brain PET features an innovative geometry that maximizes the solid angle around the subject thanks to its regular, uniform hexagonal LYSO scintillation elements, each with 17.6 mm edge and 13 mm thick. The detector modules have two depth-of-interaction (DOI) layers of 6.5 mm, constituted by two translated hexagonal grids of 181 and 183 crystals measuring 1.25 mm per edge. Flood field imaging demonstrates excellent pixel resolvability. DOI performance has been validated using collimated radioactive source. The detector achieves a global energy resolution of 14.7%. This engraving protocol outperforms current commercial solutions, which are typically limited to square pixel patterns and thin detectors. Furthermore, this technique reduces manufacturing costs and time.

Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) is one such approach that enables the combination of unsupervised prior learning and flexible application with different acquisition methods. Such flexibility is particularly important in x-ray computed tomography (CT) where acquisition protocols vary greatly depending on institution, anatomical target, patient size, etc. While most DPS research focuses on 2D image models, clinical CT reconstruction is inherently three-dimensional. Although extending DPS to 3D is mathematically simple, it is potentially computationally infeasible. This work proposes strategies for 3D DPS CT reconstruction using a 3D neural network to learn the prior, along with algorithmic modifications to reduce memory usage and accelerate sampling. The proposed approach was evaluated on clinical CT data to illustrate both performance and feasibility of 3D DPS for CT reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Cesium lead bromide (CLB) has attracted a lot of interest in the recent years as a high-Z semiconductor material for X- and gamma-ray detection with potential low production costs. The presence of lead in the compound gives it a high effective atomic number of 66 for 500 keV photons, greater than cadmium-zinc-telluride, thus achieving greater fraction of photoelectric interactions. CLB is also partially transparent to visible light, with a cutoff at approximately 550 nm. With such properties, CLB is an excellent candidate for Cherenkov Charge Induction (CCI) detectors. CCI detectors combine the conventional charge induction readout of semiconductor detectors with the detection of Cherenkov light generated by the photoelectron that results from the gamma interaction with the crystal bulk. In CLB, the high atomic number makes it a good Cherenkov emitter and the cutoff wavelength in the visible allows it to propagate through the crystal and be detected. We report on the study of the CCI detector concept with CLB on a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 \\times 5 \\times 5$</tex> mm3 crystal with one single pixel electrode of approximately 1 mm2. Preliminary data consists of the presentation of the detector, the data acquisition strategy, and representative examples of events where light and charge readouts are combined. The complete study will resemble the same work previously done with CCI TlBr detectors, where the detection time resolution, energy resolution, and drift time measurement (by means of light and charge readout) were measured. Proving the feasibility of using CLB as a material for CCI can further raise the interest of this promising material for gamma detection."

This process enables precise tumor cell destruction while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. However, a major challenge in BNCT is verifying boron distribution inside the patient. Current indirect methods, like inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy of blood samples, can only calculate the boron concentration in the sample but not its distribution in the body. To address this, we present a three-stage Compton camera capable of simultaneously imaging the 478 keV gamma rays from boron neutron capture and the 2.22 MeV gamma rays produced by hydrogen neutron capture. With the maps of emission of both gammas, the boron concentration can then be established. The innovative design of the camera, composed of scintillator cylinders, bypasses the need for full particle absorption, improving event reconstruction efficiency. We evaluated detector performance through Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The initial results point to the camera's potential to improve BNCT treatment verification by providing direct boron concentration data. This advancement promises to improve dose delivery precision and pave the way for clinical translation, with further studies planned to optimize detector sensitivity and reconstruction efficiency."

    "abstract": "Graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) aims to identify graphs that significantly deviate from the norm. Despite remarkable advancements in recent years, existing GLAD approaches struggle with the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Although some semi-supervised approaches leverage a small fraction of anomalous graphs during training, the limited diversity of these anomalies poses challenges in learning robust decision boundaries. Additionally, the detection of multi-task graph anomalies, a prevalent challenge in real-world scenarios, remains largely unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose MoEGAD, a novel framework leveraging a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture for GLAD. MoEGAD introduces an iterative anomalous graph generation module to produce pseudo-anomalous graphs, which facilitates the subsequent decision boundary learning. An early stopping mechanism is incorporated to ensure that the generated anomalies preserve sufficient dissimilarity from normal graphs. More importantly, we also propose a latent MoE module comprising multiple expert networks alongside a specialized gating network, which promotes cross-task adaptability for diverse GLAD problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring the potential of MoE architecture in the context of GLAD. Extensive experiments across single-task, large-scale, and multi-task scenarios demonstrate that MoEGAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GLAD baselines."

    "abstract": "Differentiable shift-variant filtered backprojection (SV-FBP) is a fast and efficient reconstruction algorithm for cone-beam computed tomography with non-circular trajectories. While this method is significantly faster than iterative methods, its reliance on trajectory-specific training of Radondomain weights limits its ability to generalise and reuse it across different scanning geometries. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that facilitates trajectory-generalizable learning for SV-FBP. The fundamental concept underpinning this methodology is a preprocessing pipeline that standardises a set of CBCT trajectories by reordering projections based on geometric continuity. This standardization decouples the learned SV-FBP weights from the absolute trajectory configuration, thereby making them invariant to projection order, allowing a single model to be reused across multiple trajectories. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables a single SV-FBP model to generalize across four distinct non-circular CBCT trajectories, achieving consistent performance with an average MSE of 0.1207, PSNR of 34.68 dB, and SSIM of 0.9177, without the need for retraining. This confirms the effectiveness of the standardization framework in enhancing flexibility and scalability."

    "abstract": "Modern Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is increasingly adopting flexible and applicationdriven detector designs that deviate from traditional cylindrical configurations, such as walkthrough geometries or partial rings. These designs, while advantageous for patient comfort and system integration, lead to incomplete angular coverage and consequently, severely undersampled sinograms. Such limitations result in artifacts and degraded image quality when conventional reconstruction algorithms such as Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) are applied. To address this, we propose a data-driven framework that uses conditional diffusion models to recover the missing sinogram regions for improved image reconstruction. Our method leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which we fine-tune to predict missing sinogram bins based on limited-angle (LA) inputs. Training is conducted on 2D sinograms derived via the Radon transform from a publicly available PET/CT dataset. The LA regions are simulated by randomly omitting consecutive angular bins. To integrate conditional inputs, we insert convolutional blocks at multiple scales before and after the original SD network, allowing the model to effectively incorporate the LA sinogram into its prediction. While these blocks are being trained, the UNet blocks of the SD are simultaneously fine-tuned to adapt the network, originally trained on natural images, to the domain of PET sinograms, thereby mitigating errors caused by domain shift. The model learns a prior over fully sampled sinograms while using the available partial measurements as additional information during the denoising process. When combined with the MLEM reconstruction, our approach yields an average improvement of approximately 8 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), highlighting the potential of diffusion-based generative approaches for robust PET imaging in non-standard acquisition settings."

    "abstract": "Cloud mask underpins accurate precipitation nowcasting, which in turn is vital for understanding the hydrological cycle, supporting disaster prevention, solar energy forecasting and transportation. However, cloud mask nowcasting remains challenging because meteorological data exhibit irregular temporal and spatial variations, including fine-scale structures, and often suffer from highly skewed precipitation intensity distributions. Existing methods struggle to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics and preserve fine-scale structures due to limitations in handling sparse data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. To address these issues, we propose an asymmetric dual-branch non-causal mamba U-Net (ADNM-UNet) featuring three key components: (1) The Asymmetric Dual-branch Non-causal Mamba (ADNM) implements a novel asymmetric bidirectional modeling framework that resolves directional bias in conventional Mamba architectures. This design preserves precise cloud boundary delineation while capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies in sparse data from NWP. (2) The Multi-scale Attention Enhancement Module (MAEM) enhances discriminative feature representation and suppresses spectral redundancy through anisotropic convolution kernels and hybrid pooling. This mechanism significantly improves edge retention in precipitation systems while attenuating atmospheric noise interference. (3) Complementing these advancements, the Wavelet Decomposition and Fusion Module (WDFM) maintains cloud contour integrity across scales through multiresolution decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADNM-UNet outperforms existing methods across all metrics, achieving 27.96% improvement in CSI and 22.89% in HSS for metrics over the best performing baseline models at high intensity scenarios. Our project is open source and available on GitHub at: https://github.com/kanyu369/ADNM-UNet."

Yet, such sizable datasets are difficult to obtain through real-world setups, prompting the use of Monte Carlo simulation frameworks, such as Geant4, to generate synthetic data. However, accurately reproducing experiments through simulation poses a significant challenge: key parameters – including material properties, source distributions, and detector geometry – can be poorly documented or unknown. In practice, aligning simulation outputs with real-world measurements is time-consuming and often relies on expert intuition or brute-force parameter sweeps. To address this, we propose a physics-aware optimization approach that automatically calibrates simulation parameters to match experiments. Treating Geant4 as a black box, our method leverages derivative-free optimization techniques to minimize a data-driven loss between simulated and observed outputs. Physics-informed constraints are incorporated through clipping and penalty-based regularization to enforce plausible solutions. We evaluate our approach on synthetic X-ray imaging data, comparing recovered parameters to the known ground truth and a real-world dataset with unknown parameters. In both cases, we assess image quality using standard SSIM, demonstrating accurate configuration recovery while substantially reducing manual calibration effort. Our method generalizes to various experimental setups where simulation fidelity is essential but full system specification is unavailable."

To address these issues, this study proposes a novel method for 3D shape estimation of interventional devices. The approach utilizes a flexible ferromagnetic-tipped guidewire, which exhibits mechanical properties similar to conventional guidewires, to estimate its shape by correlating the magnetic field distribution with the guidewire’s geometry. Due to the nonlinear relationship between the magnetic field and the guidewire shape, image and physical constraints were applied to refine the estimation. Experimental results demonstrated high accuracy and stability, with root mean square error and Hausdorff distance both below 1 mm, surpassing existing methods. Notably, this technique requires no built-in sensors or additional wiring, and the fluoroscopic images used are standard in clinical practice, ensuring minimal interference with clinical procedures.

Using an abdominal CT phantom, scans were performed at varying kVp, CTDI, and rotation angles. After image registration and segmentation, 107 radiomic features from shape, first order statistics, and texture matrices (GLCM, GLDM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM) were extracted using PyRadiomics and matRadiomics. Features were then analyzed for normal distribution using skewness, CV, and kurtosis coefficients, resulting in 59 remaining features. The reproducibility of these features was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). The results showed that some GLRLM and GLDM features, especially Low Gray-Level Run Emphasis (LGLRE), Long-Run Low GrayLevel Emphasis (LRLGLE), and Low Gray-Level Emphasis (LGLE) displayed significant reproducibility. A Random Forest model utilizing Next Generation Texture Data Matrix (NGTDM) features achieved 91% accuracy in predicting object contrast, highlighting the importance of NGTDM-Contrast and NGTDM-Strength in differentiating contrasts. While the model demonstrated potential, challenges were encountered due to small objects and non-uniform noise, suggesting the need for further refinement.

One objective of the proposed scheme is to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is provided to maximize the network’s sensing performance, subject to secrecy and total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with equidistant PAs by 3 dB in terms of sensing reflected power, while it can provide gains of up to 30 dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays."

    "abstract": "Muon scattering tomography (MST) has emerged as a promising imaging modality since the introduction of the point of closest approach (PoCA) algorithm by Schultz et al. in 2003. Since then, MST has been applied across a range of fields, including geology, civil engineering, archaeology, and nuclear security. Despite its widespread use, the PoCA algorithm has inherent limitations due to its underlying assumption of single scattering, which does not adequately represent the multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) behavior of muons as they traverse dense materials. To overcome this limitation, a reconstruction algorithm that models MCS using a Gaussian approximation with a Bayesian framework is proposed. The resulting method, referred to as the muon trajectory reconstruction ($\\Mu$TRec) algorithm, aims to more accurately estimate the curved trajectories of muons through matter. This enhanced modeling leads to improved resolution in tomographic reconstructions. For instance, when applied to the detection of a missing fuel assembly (FA) within a spent nuclear fuel (SNF) dry storage cask (DSC), $\\Mu$TRec achieves comparable detection performance with nearly 20 times fewer muons than the PoCA algorithm."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of intelligent perception systems and autonomous navigation technologies imposes increasingly stringent requirements on state estimation algorithms regarding modeling capacity, robustness, and real-time performance. While traditional Kalman Filter (KF) demonstrates computational efficiency and mathematical interpretability for linear Gaussian systems, their effectiveness diminishes in nonlinear, non-Gaussian, and non-stationary dynamic scenarios. Recent developments in neural state space modeling offer new perspectives for recursive estimation, yet existing approaches suffer from structural complexity, training difficulties, and inadequate real-time capability. This paper presents Mamba-KF, a novel state estimation framework integrating deep modeling with recursive filtering. Leveraging the cutting-edge Mamba state space neural network, our method dynamically generates state transition parameters while establishing a differentiable covariance propagation pathway, enabling end-to-end optimization. We further design a lightweight multi-modal fusion architecture tailored for high-frequency sensory data processing in real-time applications. Evaluated on the EuRoC Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) dataset, Mamba-KF attains the lowest errors across states, reducing position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by up to 33.3% relative to Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and 24.1% relative to Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) at 10 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), with an average velocity RMSE of 0.097 m/s and an orientation error of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.3^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula>.

Under robustness evaluations, Mamba-KF yields the lowest RMSEs and suppresses divergence observed in EKF. Computationally, it maintains near real-time performance with 0.65 ms per step, offering a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off for visual-inertial navigation and autonomous systems, while providing significant theoretical insights and promising engineering applications."

These artifacts, mainly caused by internal system structures and detector cross-talk, degrade image quality. Instead of relying on traditional scattering kernel-based corrections with limited adaptability, the method learns the spatial variation pattern of system-induced artifacts. Scattering-dominant images are acquired using high-density shielding to suppress primary transmission and highlight system artifacts. A lightweight convolutional neural network is trained to capture normalized spatial distribution patterns of the streaks. During inference, the input image's amplitude is convolved with the learned pattern to estimate the scatter component, which is then subtracted or compensated for accordingly. Experiments on real-world DR systems confirm effective suppression of system-generated stripes and improved image clarity, with strong generalizability across objects."

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence and automation into safety-critical domains, such as air traffic management (ATM), raises new challenges in managing operators’ trust and fatigue under high-workload conditions. Although transparency regulation has been identified as a key factor shaping human–automation interaction, prior work has largely focused on driving or monitoring tasks. Little attention has been paid to managing complex work, such as air traffic control. Moreover, trust and fatigue are typically examined in isolation, with limited understanding of their dynamic interplay in human–machine collaboration. This article introduces a transparency-regulated ATM simulation platform that allows three fixed transparency levels (low, mid, and high) and a user-switchable (mix) mode, enabling controlled investigation of effects on operators’ trust and fatigue. Multimodal data were collected from eye tracking, electroencephalography, and system status logs under varying transparency and workload conditions. By applying machine learning and deep learning approaches, we compare unimodal and multimodal prediction of trust and fatigue. The results show that increasing transparency enhances operators’ understanding, trust, and willingness to rely on the system, while multimodal fusion achieves superior predictive accuracy compared with single-modality inputs. The findings reveal a positive but nonlinear coupling between trust and fatigue, suggesting that adaptive transparency can balance operators’ reliance and cognitive effort. In particular, temporal deep models exhibit strong sensitivity to eye tracking features. Overall, this article contributes a unified framework linking transparency regulation, multimodal state estimation, and adaptive interface design, offering theoretical and practical insights for building resilient ATM automation systems that maintain appropriate trust while mitigating fatigue risks."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) detectors have emerged as an effective structure for enhancing charge collection in radiation sensors by decoupling electrode spacing from detector thickness. This enables improved electric field control and shorter carrier transit paths without reducing sensitive volume. Diamond is a highly promising material for such devices, owing to its wide bandgap, high carrier mobility, radiation hardness, and thermal stability. These properties make diamond especially suited to 3D detector designs where charge transport efficiency and environmental resilience are critical. However, fabricating 3D electrode structures in diamond has typically required femtosecond lasers and specialized optical systems, increasing cost and complexity. In this work, we report a 3D diamond detector fabricated using a simple nanosecond-pulsed laser to embed conductive all-carbon electrodes directly into single-crystal CVD diamond. The embedded graphite patterns act as both charge collection electrodes and signal readout lines, eliminating the need for metallization. Under alpha irradiation, the detector achieved 94.0 % charge collection efficiency (CCE) at 60 V. The 3D layout enables narrow electrode spacing, enabled by successfully localized graphite electrode embedding. This contributes directly to the high CCE observed. These results demonstrate a simple and robust fabrication method for high-performance 3D diamond detectors suited for nuclear, space, and medical applications."

The type of penalty and its strength have a strong impact on the reconstructed image quality, as they control the balance between reducing noise and preserving important details. Defining appropriate values for these parameters is difficult due to the variability of clinical data properties and usage purposes. We propose a supervised deep learning approach, based on a residual neural network, that uses directly the raw sinograms to predict the optimal regularization parameters of the relative difference prior used with the modified BSREM algorithm. This network, trained on synthetic 2D sinograms paired with optimal values of regularization parameters, learns to map raw data to optimal settings. This approach allows for fast, automated parameter selection, avoiding manual tuning. It generalizes well across phantom types and consistently produces high-quality reconstructions, supporting more efficient and reliable PET imaging workflows."

The perception is carried out by a spectrum sensing module providing the true relevant spectral parameters of the sources in the environment. The action stage employs a tailored signal design process, synthesizing a radar waveform with bespoke spectral notches, enabling ISAR imaging over a wide spectral bandwidth without interfering with the other radio frequency (RF) sources. A key enabling requirement for the proposed application is the capability to successfully recover possible missing data in the frequency domain (induced by spectral notches) and in the slow-time dimension (enabling concurrent RF activities still in a cognitive fashion). This process is carried out by resorting to advanced methods based on either the compressed-sensing framework or a rank-minimization recovery strategy. The capabilities of the proposed system are assessed exploiting a dataset of drone measurements in the frequency band between 13 GHz and 15 GHz. Results highlight the effectiveness of the devised architecture to enable spectral compatibility while delivering high-quality ISAR images as well as additional RF activities."

    "abstract": "Port underwater inspection is essential for ensuring maritime safety and operational continuity. However, low visibility and complex environments make it challenging to achieve reliable detection. This study addresses the issue of underwater target recognition based on multibeam sonar imagery. Specifically, we propose YOLO-ShuffleNet-BiFPN-EIOU, an enhanced YOLOv5 detection framework with three key improvements: first, the adoption of the lightweight backbone network ShuffleNetv2, second, the incorporation of a bidirectional feature pyramid network, and third, the optimization of the enhanced intersection over union loss function. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the maximum permissible velocity threshold for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), leading to a novel velocity-constrained controller that improves sonar imaging quality. A general transformation function is applied, and a functional dependence with quasi-linear characteristics between the independent and dependent variables is established, converting the partially constrained AUV system into an unconstrained one. Finally, experiments conducted in a pool and a real-world port demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to YOLOv5m, with mAP@0.5 increasing by 3.4%, mAP@0.5:0.95 improving by 5.3%, giga floating-point operations per second reduced by 89.8%, and the velocity-constrained AUV operation effectively enhances detection performance."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel 6G downlink waveform designed for passive coherent location (PCL) using orthogonal time–frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Targeting private campus networks, the approach enables passive sensing without active signal emission, addressing key challenges of energy consumption, interference, and cost in industrial automation. The OTFS framework operates in the delay–Doppler domain, allowing seamless integration of radar functionality into communication signals while maintaining synchronization-free operation through local signal processing. A comprehensive simulation-based analysis of OTFS grid configurations reveals fundamental trade-offs between sensing resolution and computational efficiency. Controlled ray-traced simulations support the theoretical framework, indicating high-resolution target detection capabilities that meet 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) requirements for autonomous mobile robot (AMR) navigation. The proposed architecture offers power advantages through elimination of transmit amplification, the primary power consumer in active radar systems, and provides inherent privacy advantages through passive operation and distributed processing. Processing chain analysis reveals strong compatibility with multistatic extensions, requiring only evolutionary modifications rather than fundamental redesign. Simulation results suggest the feasibility of dual-use signaling in future 6G networks, with applications extending beyond industrial automation to smart cities, traffic monitoring, and public safety systems."

The spectrometer comprises two 2 -inch EJ-309 scintillation detectors, each positioned 20 cm away at a 45-degree angle from the neutron beam port to detect gamma rays emitted from the target, and a 3-inch EJ-309 detector located at a flight distance of 294 cm to measure neutrons.

With an operating frequency of 73.13 MHz, the cyclotron produces proton bunches at 13.67 -ns intervals, resulting in repetitive gamma-ray and neutron bursts that produce periodic gamma-ray/gamma-ray and gamma-ray/neutron coincidence events in the measured TOF spectrum. A dedicated method was developed to extract the neutron spectrum from these repetitive distributions. An effective time window of 13.67 ns was identified to resolve neutron energies within a constrained range of 16.19 to 30 MeV. The measured neutron spectrum exhibits a quasi-monoenergetic distribution with a clear peak at 26 MeV, in excellent agreement with the spectrum simulated by a Monte Carlo model in prior work. This technique provides a reliable approach for implementing quality assurance of proton-cyclotron-based neutron sources."

    "abstract": "Interior computed tomography reduces radiation exposure by limiting the X-ray projection data acquisition solely to a region of interest (ROI). However, due to the truncation of projection data, traditional reconstruction methods often result in severe cupping artifacts within the ROI. Existing methods have attempted to combine differentiated backprojection (DBP, an analytic reconstruction method based on backprojection) with convolutional neural networks(CNNs). Nevertheless, these approaches have not fully resolved issues related to insufficient image detail, necessitating further optimization. To further address these challenges, this study proposes an improved deep learning framework named DAS-Net. Building upon previous methods, DAS-Net incorporates two major innovations: (1) introducing ASUformer, a novel CNN architecture integrating a Transformer structure, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), and a Sparse Coding Block, significantly enhancing the recovery of image details; and (2) combining the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) with neural networks, and designing two reconstruction strategies: (a) applying SART before the neural network, and (b) applying the neural network prior to SART. To evaluate the reconstruction performance of the proposed framework across varying ROI sizes, we conducted multi-scale data training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that DAS-Net consistently achieves superior robustness and reconstruction performance for different ROI sizes. Specifically, the “neural network followed by SART” strategy is particularly effective in enhancing image detail recovery and data consistency. Compared with conventional methods, DAS-Net exhibits significant advantages in artifact suppression and detail fidelity, highlighting its substantial potential for clinical applications."

The generator was constructed with an encoder-decoder architecture, and dilated convolution layers were added into the generator architecture for aggregating contextual features. Global and local discriminators were used to separately determine the reality of restored and non-truncated regions, and binary mask images were additionally input into the generator for differentiating truncated regions from non-truncated regions. The results showed that the proposed network sufficiently reduced truncation artifacts in sDT images. Also, the noise property and quantitative accuracy of sDT images were improved by the proposed network. In conclusion, the proposed DCGAN can be potentially used for improving the quality of sDT images and overcoming the issue of the sDT system."

The approach employed in this work differs from the widely known methods, such as the self-seeding vertical Bridgman (SSVB) method. In the known method SSVB, the crystal grows from a single point due to the sharp conical bottom of the ampoule, or the growth begins from an oriented seed. In our proposed method, spontaneous nucleation of the single crystal occurs at the crystallization front plane. This method does not require complex growth ampoules, significantly reduces the risk of raw material contamination, and shows promise for producing organic single crystals with a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\pi$</tex>-stacked crystalline structure.

    "abstract": "The limited availability of essay feedback datasets with trait-level annotations has led research in essay evaluation to focus primarily on either automated essay scoring (AES) or feedback generation. In this paper, we introduce LEAF++, an extension of the Learner’s Essay and Feedback (LEAF) dataset, enriched with trait-level scores alongside the original feedback. These trait scores enable a detailed analysis of essay aspects and provide a basis for validating their relationship with feedback. To assess the dataset, we propose four LLM-based validation approaches. Score2Feedback examines whether trait scores guide LLMs to generate feedback similar to the reference feedback. Feedback2Score evaluates whether using reference feedback to revise an essay improves trait scores. Feedback<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">via</i>Reference iteratively refines feedback, guided by trait scores, until it meets a minimum similarity threshold with the reference.

These strategies allow us to validate trait scores by measuring their impact on feedback generation and essay revisions, highlighting the relationship between trait-level scores and corresponding feedback. Our experiments using prompting (LLaMA-3, Mistral, Falcon-3, Phi-3) and fine-tuning (LLaMA-3, Mistral, and GPT-OSS) show that trait scores effectively guide LLMs to generate meaningful feedback. The results demonstrate that the annotated trait scores are meaningfully related to the corresponding essay feedback. LEAF++ Dataset: https://github.com/misgna/LEAF-plusplus."

Although current rPPG methods have achieved remarkable performance through extensive data training, they often ignore the transmission cost and privacy concerns of rPPG data. Federated learning (FL) pro vides a promising solution to these issues. However, effective federated training remains challenging due to the cross-domain heterogeneity that arises when using multi source rPPG data. To address these challenges, we characterize the heterogeneity of multi-source rPPG data from both the input and output domain perspectives. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce pseudo-labeling techniques and propose a novel FL framework, FedGRC. Specifically, we incorporate automatic gradient regularization calibration to mitigate the impact of input domain discrepancies on model performance. Furthermore, we leverage pseudo labels generated by handcrafted rPPG methods to align the output domain and reduce label inconsistencies across datasets. Our approach is validated across six publicly available datasets, demonstrating significant advantages over other approaches and effectively addressing the challenges of privacy protection and heterogeneity of multisource data."

While hybrid pixel detectors have become the standard for higher energies ( 2-20 keV), their potential for soft X-ray applications is now being explored, owing to their high frame rates, wide dynamic range, large area coverage, and excellent signal-to-noise ratio. Low Gain Avalanche Diodes have emerged as promising candidates for this endeavor due to their moderate internal gain (typically 5-10), which may help overcome signal-to-noise challenges inherent to soft X-ray detection. Nevertheless, significant obstacles remain in fully leveraging LGAD technology at these lower energies. In this study, we introduce a novel sensor architecture - the Deep Junction LGAD which features a specifically tailored charge-absorbing region designed to ensure complete absorption of soft X-rays. This is followed by a gain layer that enables uniform signal amplification above the noise threshold of the readout electronics. We present the device design, simulation results, and preliminary static characterization, highlighting the potential of DJ-LGADs as a promising solution for next-generation soft X-ray detection."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time control framework for nonlinear pure-feedback systems with unknown dynamics to satisfy reach-avoid-stay tasks within a prescribed time in dynamic environments. To achieve this, we introduce a real-time spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework. An STT is defined as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius adapt online using only real-time sensory input. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is then derived to constrain the system output within the STT, ensuring safety and task satisfaction. We provide formal guarantees for obstacle avoidance and on-time task completion. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulations and hardware experiments on a mobile robot and an aerial vehicle, navigating in cluttered dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Learning Management Systems (LMS) are crucial for managing e-learning and employee training. However, most in-house LMS platforms often suffer from low usability, inefficient task flows, and poor visual design. This research presents the redesign of an LMS called Platform Informasi dan Pengetahuan Digital (PIPD), implemented in a financial services company referred to as Company X. The redesign was guided by the Activity-Centered Design (ACD) methodology, which focusses on designing systems based on user activity rather than profiles, making it particularly suited for structured work environments. The redesign process involved two iterations: first, a low-fidelity wireframe prototype that addressed layout and navigation issues, and second, a high-fidelity interactive prototype that focused on usability, aesthetics, and branding. Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Single Ease Question (SEQ), task completion times, and success rates. Prior to the redesign, the SUS scores were 35 (Teacher) and 39.5 (Learner), indicating poor usability. Post-redesign, the scores improved significantly to 80 and 91.5, with SEQ averages exceeding 6.6 and a 100% success rate in task completion. Finally, the interactive prototype was tested using the same scenarios, followed by additional SUS and SEQ evaluations. The results illustrate that ACD markedly enhances the usability of enterprise-level LMS platforms. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical usability testing conducted in a real-world organizational setting, confirming the effectiveness of ACD."

Existing deep learning benchmarks on the public I-Nema dataset show limited performance and significant misclassification between specific genera. This study addresses these limitations by proposing and evaluating a model based on the ConvNeXtV2 Tiny architecture, a modern convolutional neural network enhanced with a self-supervised pretraining strategy (FCMAE). A crucial part of our methodology is a targeted data pre-processing step to identify and remove cross-class duplicate images, thereby resolving known dataset ambiguities. Evaluated on a prepared 40-genus subset of the I-Nema dataset, our proposed model achieves a new state-of-the-art overall accuracy of 95.63%, significantly surpassing the previous benchmark of 86.78%. This work demonstrates that the combination of an advanced architecture with rigorous data cleaning is highly effective for this task and establishes a new, more reliable performance benchmark for automated nematode identification."

However, existing methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from insufficient generalization ability and high training costs when applied to new domains or in data-sparse scenarios. Inspired by the \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose a novel framework—PromptLP—which integrates pre-training and prompt tuning into heterogeneous graph link prediction tasks.The framework consists of two stages: First, pre-training is conducted on large-scale heterogeneous graphs through a meta-path-based self-supervised link prediction task. Second, in downstream tasks, the pre-trained model is frozen, and only the lightweight prompt module is fine-tuned to adapt to specific tasks. To verify the effectiveness of the framework, we conducted experiments on academic datasets such as ACM and DBLP. The results show that PromptLP significantly outperforms baseline models and exhibits excellent performance and generalization ability in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating its great potential in graph link prediction."

Existing methods suffer from insufficient diversity among weak classifiers and low efficiency in handling nonlinear data patterns, leading to unsatisfactory generalization ability. This study proposes a new weak classifier construction method based on pruned random decision trees-combined with a multi-objective optimized QBoost model-to fix these problems. Weak classifiers are constructed using random subspaces with adaptive tree pruning; this enhances diversity while cutting overfitting. For QBoost, the study introduces a multi-objective optimization framework to minimize classification loss and maximize weak classifier diversity at the same time, and uses an improved AdamW algorithm to speed up convergence. Experiments on KDD Cup 99, IMDb, and Covertype datasets show the proposed method hits $96.8 \\%$ classification accuracy on KDD Cup 99- $\\mathbf{3. 3 \\%}$ higher than Gradient Boosting ($93.5 \\%$) and $2.6 \\%$ higher than standard QBoost ($94.2 \\%$).

While conventional machine learning approaches for IDS often suffer from limitations including static decision-making pipelines, inherent model opacity, and difficulty in adapting to novel attack vectors, this work introduces a novel, modular, interpretable, and adaptive AI pipeline for robust threat classification. Leveraging the well-established CICIDS2017 benchmark dataset, we construct an end-to-end framework that integrates high-performance Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for comprehensive feature attribution. Crucially, the pipeline incorporates a feedback-driven closed-loop mechanism enabling dynamic model retraining and adaptation to evolving threat landscapes. This integrated architecture not only achieves exceptionally high classification performance, with the XGBoost model yielding 99.96% accuracy and a 0.92 Macro F1-score across 15 diverse attack types, but also significantly enhances the transparency, maintainability, and real-world adaptability required for modern security operations. We provide detailed insights into model behavior and data characteristics through extensive SHAP analysis, t-SNE clustering visualizations, and a comprehensive class-wise performance breakdown, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in handling significant class imbalance and improving generalization. The resulting pipeline is engineered to be deployable, inherently interpretable, and ready for integration into production-scale cybersecurity environments, offering a significant step towards trustworthy and resilient AI-powered IDS."

This means that it was able to accurately capture complex nonlinear interactions in the data. The Gradient Boosting model came next, with a good level of accuracy. The Multiple Linear Regression model did the worst. The best-performing model was used in a web app so that people could estimate property prices in real time. This study introduces a robust, data-driven property valuation system employing ensemble learning techniques, functioning as a practical reference for stakeholders and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in the Indonesian real estate market."

This study proposes a pothole detection system using the YOLOv11 model with additional spatial position classification and distance estimation features. The model was trained using three dataset scenarios: a project-specific dataset, a mixed dataset without augmentation, and a mixed dataset with augmentation, where the third scenario achieved the best performance with 88.1% precision, 79.4% recall, and 86.8% mAP@0.5. In position classification, a 10% margin yielded the most balanced results, detecting 996 potholes as Left, 405 as Center, and 1024 as Right. However, distance estimation was found to be inconsistent due to the fixed pothole width assumption of 0.5 meters, as observed from the output video. The novelty of this research lies in extending pothole detection beyond binary identification by incorporating lane-based spatial information and preliminary distance estimation, which are often overlooked in prior works. These enhancements provide more contextual awareness for drivers and authorities, supporting safer navigation and better-informed road maintenance decisions. While the current approach shows promising performance, limitations in distance accuracy highlight the need for dynamic width estimation, integration with depth sensors, and broader testing under diverse road and environmental conditions. Overall, the proposed system demonstrates the potential of computer vision, particularly YOLOv11, to contribute to smarter transportation systems and proactive road safety management."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the development of a model for forecasting changes in distributed energy system parameters over a specific period of time. When analyzing a distributed energy system, it is taken into account that it consists of multiple modules characterized by various parameters that differ from one another. Forecasting requires using data on individual local objects of the distributed energy system when solving the problem of further analysis of larger objects. The behavior of smaller modules determines the behavior of larger modules of the system. It is necessary to determine the overall behavior of the distributed energy system as the parameters of objects change over time and the internal connections between its components change. To this end, it is proposed to develop a model for forecasting the parameters of system objects. This model takes into account that variable parameters in small modules will directly influence changes in the values of parameters of larger modules. By using difference equations in calculations, the most optimal forecast of changes in the parameters of system objects is obtained. The calculation was performed taking into account the time-varying mathematical expectation. Therefore, the calculation results in a minimum root-mean-square error. The design and actual system capacities are examined. An energy loss forecast is made. The error in this forecast of changes in distributed energy system parameters is determined."

    "abstract": "Time series forecasters are widely used across various domains. Among them, MLP(multi-layer perceptron)-based forecasters have been proven to be more robust to noise compared to Transformer-based forecasters. However, MLP struggles to capture complex features, resulting in limitations on capturing long-range dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose the XLinear, a MLP-based forecaster for long-range forecasting. Firstly, we decompose the time series into trend and seasonal components. For the trend component which contains long-range characteristics, we design EFA (Enhanced Frequency Attention) to capture long-term dependencies by leveraging frequency-domain operations. Additionally, a CrossFilter Block is proposed for the seasonal component to keep the model’s robustness to noise, avoiding the problems of low robustness caused by the attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that XLinear achieves state-of-the-art performance on test datasets. While keeping the lightweight architecture and high robustness of MLP-based models, our forecaster outperforms other MLP-based forecasters in capturing long-range dependencies."

At the same time, in order to improve the matching robustness in the scene of perspective difference, the CFI module is introduced for feature enhancement and spatial attention guidance. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on a public dataset. Experimental results show that the reasoning speed and accuracy of the improved model are better than the original LightGlue, and it has higher practical application potential."

Over the past decades, significant progress in this area has been observed due to the constant expansion of computing resources, as well as the development of new methods and algorithms for data processing. One of the important branches of computing science is fog computing, which is studied as a tool for modeling and analyzing systems with fuzzy data. Fog computing finds its application in many areas, including artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision making, and others. In this paper the specifics of building systems with fog computing were analyzed in detail, and the specifics of using polling networks, in particular sensor networks, were also considered. Various approaches to the integration of polling networks in the context of sensor technologies have been studied, which allows to increase the efficiency of data collection and transmission. Based on the obtained results, a method of organizing fog computing was developed, which takes into account the specifics of modern network architectures. A new architecture of the method is proposed, which contributes to improving the performance and reliability of the system due to the optimization of computing resources and ensuring more efficient data management. Mathematical experiments were also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, which showed significant improvements compared to traditional methods."

The following methods were used to develop digital models: statistical Bayesian classification of defects in oil-filled transformers based on the results of oil-dissolved gas analysis; fuzzy-logical inference for the formation and rules of making operational decisions; synthesis and analysis of tree events to identify undesirable outcomes, ranking cause-and-effect relationships, and determining the accuracy of the consequences of impacts on oil-filled transformer equipment.

The hydrogen travels along the conductor and is entering topside umbilical termination units (TUTU's). Installation of barrier style cable glands will not stop the transfer of the hydrogen into the enclosure as it is between the conductor strands. With the hydrogen entry into the enclosure it creates a hazardous environment; Cl D1 or Zone 0/1, inside the enclosure. There have been real life examples of where this phenomenon has caused medium voltage 6.6kV, 11 kV and 13.8kV enclosures to rupture. This paper looks at a real life example where an enclosure exploded on an offshore installation causing damages the possible causes for the hydrogen release inside the conductor of the subsea cables and the steps that can be taken with the enclosures to ensure rupturing internally cannot occur."

To further improve the performance of the algorithm, the idea of variable step size is introduced into this algorithm, and the variable step-size Sigmoid Affine Projection Algorithm with Fourth-Power Error Function (VSS-SAPA-4th) is proposed. its step size update formula is derived by calculating the optimal step size and integrating the time-averaging method.

It dynamically adjusts feature fusion between carrier and secret videos through adaptive weight allocation, suppressing redundant information and enhancing steganographic capacity. Experiments on small-scale datasets show that GAB3D-VSN improves PSNR, SSIM, and VIF metrics by 0.17 dB, 1.72%, and 2.89% respectively, compared to the baseline model, with excellent visual imperceptibility. Systematic ablation studies further demonstrate the synergistic optimization between the 3D attention mechanism and the reversible network architecture, validating the model's effectiveness."

Here, we fit single-shell DTI and multishell NODDI to dMRI data from 533 ADNI3/4 participants to assess their association with key clinical indicators of AD such as cognitive impairment, amyloid-beta and tau PET burden. Overall, we found that NODDI showed comparable associations with cognitive impairment and tau pathology, but somewhat stronger relationships with amyloid pathology."

Three key parameters—magnitude, depth, and epicentral distance to Panggarangan Village—were analyzed after a preprocessing stage to ensure data completeness and consistency. Visual analyses included bar charts, two-dimensional and three-dimensional scatter plots, and geospatial overlays with tectonic plate boundaries. The results showed that shallow earthquakes (<70 km) with micro-to-small magnitudes (M 2–4) dominate the seismic profile and are concentrated within 160 km of the reference point. Intermediate- and deep-focus events were infrequent, while moderate-to-strong earthquakes occurred sporadically but remained critical owing to their potential impact on nearby communities. Clustering patterns broadly align with the southeastward motion of the Eurasian Plate, although the 2025 distributions appeared more scattered. A key contribution of this study is the integration of interactive visualizations into the GMLS platform, enabling local stakeholders and communities to directly explore seismic data in real time. This approach not only strengthens earthquake risk communication but also provides a replicable model for community-based disaster preparedness in tectonically active regions."

The findings reveal that: The average shortest path length of both networks increases with the rise in node addition probability and the decline in edge addition probability. The average clustering coefficient decreases as the node addition probability increases and the edge addition probability decreases. Meanwhile, the inter-layer similarity and edge overlap between the two networks remain essentially constant, suggesting that despite the differences between the communication network and C2 network, they exhibit a certain degree of synchrony during the evolutionary process."

However, applying semantic segmentation to high-resolution UAV imagery presents unique challenges, including extreme resolutions, complex backgrounds, and severe class imbalance, which existing methods struggle to address effectively. In this work, we propose UAVNet, a novel architecture specifically designed for high-resolution UAV semantic segmentation. UAVNet introduces three key innovations: (1) a transformer decoder-enhanced classifier that dynamically adapts to complex aerial views by generating sample-specific classifiers during training; (2) a high-level feature guidance mechanism to prevent noise propagation during upsampling; and (3) A tailored training paradigm incorporating whole-image cropping and random rotation to address challenges posed by extreme resolutions and varying angles. Extensive experiments on the Semantic Drone dataset demonstrate UAVNet’s superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an 82.65% mIoU, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work bridges the gap between ground-level segmentation models and the unique demands of UAV imagery, enabling fine-grained aerial scene understanding."

    "abstract": "This study presents a methodology for simulating flow in a lid-driven square cavity using physics-informed radial basis function networks. The simulation is performed by means of three independent radial basis function networks: two for velocity components and one for pressure. These networks are coupled through a common error functional that incorporates the sum of squared residuals of the governing equations and boundary conditions. Gaussian functions are employed as radial basis functions. For training the physics-informed radial basis function networks, the Sophia optimizer has been adapted, which updates not only the network weights but also the parameters of the radial basis functions, using a simplified diagonal approximation of the Hessian. In addition, first-order optimization methods—gradient descent, Nesterov accelerated gradient, and ADAM—as well as the second-order Levenberg– Marquardt algorithm have been adapted for training. These methods also adjust both network weights and radial basis function parameters. The adapted Sophia optimizer demonstrated higher accuracy compared to first-order methods. Although it requires more iterations than the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, it achieves comparable computational efficiency by eliminating the need to solve linear systems at each step. Specialized extensions to the TensorFlow library have been developed to implement radial basis function layers, loss functions, and the customized training algorithm."

    "abstract": "This work presents a practical document-level semantic annotation scheme for the Uzbek language and two target datasets of 1200 and 1500 documents designed for three tasks: topic classification (THEME/SUB), communicative function (FUNC), and concise abstractive summarization (one sentence). We release a reproducible pipeline (70/15/15 splits, training and evaluation scripts, report templates) and demonstrate reference results on a synthetic 2700-document stand that mirrors the size and class distributions of the intended corpora. Strong baselines based on TF-IDF+LR/SVM reach high accuracy for THEME and FUNC; a multilingual Transformer (XLM-R/DistilBERT) further improves performance on borderline cases. For summarization, we compare an extractive centroid against an abstractive mT5-small model constrained to a single sentence. Methodologically, our scheme relies on clear guidelines and a pilot double-annotation with Cohen’s κ; engineering-wise, it favors transparent protocols and low-cost baselines, making the solution appropriate both for production systems and for scholarly assessment."

    "abstract": "Finding relevant news is becoming increasingly difficult for users. Currently, people often experience information overload due to the abundance of online news sources available, making it difficult for them to select news that interests them. To address this issue, a news recommendation system is needed to help users select news that aligns with their preferences. Based on previous research, the developed recommendation systems still have limitations, such as reliance on ratings or features without dimensionality reduction, text vector similarity measurement, or recommendations based solely on users’ previous behavior. Therefore, we propose a more comprehensive approach by combining Collaborative Filtering, which builds a model based on user behavior, and Content-Based Filtering, which builds a model based on item descriptions and preference profiles. We apply the Singular Value Decomposition method to find the latent representation of user interactions, as well as cosine similarity to measure the similarity between items or users. The evaluation results show that the hybrid method achieved a recall of 0.66, a precision of 0.40, and an F1-score of 0.46. Meanwhile, single methods such as Collaborative Filtering achieved a recall of 0.53, precision of 0.32, and an F1-score of 0.40, while Content-Based Filtering achieved a recall of 0.60, precision of 0.36, and an F1-score of 0.45. The results of this study show that the hybrid method is effective in news recommendation systems with good ability to identify relevant information."

    "abstract": "To address the difficulty in identifying early-stage faults in main reducer gears of new energy vehicles under variable load and high-speed conditions, a health prediction method based on a CNN-LSTM fusion model is proposed. Wavelet denoising is performed on the vibration signal to extract multi-domain features. A CNN extracts local features, and an LSTM captures temporal patterns, enabling collaborative prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) and fault level. Bench tests show that this method achieves an MAE of 2.1h and an RMSE of 2.8h in RUL prediction, representing reductions of 53.3% and 44.7% compared to the individual CNN and LSTM methods, respectively. The fault classification accuracy is 96.8% and 96.5%, significantly improving the SVM and BP networks. In noise robustness testing, the Accuracy (ACC) fluctuates by only 7% when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced to 10dB. In small-sample experiments, the Accuracy (ACC) remains at 89.3% with only 20 samples per class, outperforming the competing models. The CNN-LSTM MAE fluctuation at different speeds is less than 15%, demonstrating its stability and application potential under complex operating conditions."

Therefore, this paper designs a UAV orchard operation weather station system based on RK3568B2 and Android application. The weather station system has realized the functions of measuring and displaying meteorological data of wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity and pressure. It uses RK3568B2 development board as the core board, and uses a small ultrasonic integrated sensor to measure meteorological data. The system is equipped with a 5.5-inch display/touch screen for displaying meteorological information data and user interaction. In the Android Studio environment, the Android application software (APP) of the weather station is developed. The system provides accurate meteorological data support for UAV operation and assists UAV to adjust operation planning in real time.

In this work, we propose a weakly supervised training framework that adapts SAM to medical images using only sparse point annotations. Our approach constructs foreground and background token banks from training images and generates pseudo-labels for new samples via similarity in SAM’s encoder space. We fine-tune the mask decoder while keeping the image and prompt encoders frozen. To guide training and checkpoint selection, we introduce a novel score that correlates with segmentation quality without requiring ground truth. Our method eliminates the need for dense annotations or prompts at inference time, enabling fast and automated segmentation. Experiments on microscopy datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and achieves competitive performance relative to fully supervised methods."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the development of an intelligent control system to optimize plant growth within Temporary Immersion Systems (TIS) by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms. TIS has emerged as a promising approach for in vitro plant cultivation, offering improved nutrient uptake and aeration compared to conventional methods. However, its efficiency depends heavily on precise control of environmental and physiological parameters such as temperature, humidity, immersion frequency, and nutrient circulation. To address this challenge, the proposed system employs IoT-based sensors for real-time monitoring and data collection, which are then analyzed through ML algorithms to predict and regulate plant growth. Several algorithms were applied, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Among these, Gradient Boosting achieved the highest prediction accuracy, with an R-square value of 0.8711 for node number, indicating its superior ability to model plant growth dynamics. The adaptive control enabled by this approach provides not only scientific insights into plant development but also practical benefits such as reduced cultivation time, enhanced plantlet survival, and increased growth rates. Beyond technical outcomes, the study highlights the broader implications of adopting IoT-ML integration in TIS, including economic efficiency, resource sustainability, and scalability for industrial and research applications. The ultimate objective is to establish a robust and intelligent cultivation framework that leverages real-time data and predictive modeling to accelerate plant propagation and improve overall plantlet vigor."

The widespread deployment of light-emitting diode lighting systems opens up opportunities for the implementation of promising wireless optical communication technology - Visible Light Communication. This technology transmits data via visible light and offers several advantages over radio-frequency solutions. In the context of medical applications, this is high throughput, data privacy, and the absence of electromagnetic interference on the operation of sensitive medical equipment. However, its implementation is constrained by the requirement for a direct line-of-sight between the receiver and transmitter, and high sensitivity to external optical interference. The study presents models in line-of-sight and no-line-of-sight conditions indoors to assess data transmission parameters and identify factors affecting communication reliability. Using the OptiSystem simulation platform, the effect of emission and incidence angles, along with multipath signal propagation caused by surfaces reflections, we analyzed. The results allowed the determination of optimal emission and incidence angles ranges, and the assessment of the influence of the receiver field-of-view on system throughput. The findings can be applied to the design and integration Visible Light Communication technology into medical applications, including mobile and stationary monitoring systems."

A dataset comprising 10 S4C studies was used, from which frames were extracted and preprocessed. Preprocessing included metadata removal, resizing to 224×224 pixels, and data augmentation. The resulting images were divided into training (2068 images per class), validation (517 images per class), and test (200 images per class) sets. Two convolutional neural network architectures, VGG-16 and Vision Transformer (ViT), were trained and evaluated. The VGG-16 model, trained for 30 epochs, achieved a test accuracy of 0.98 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 1.00. The Vision Transformer, trained for 30 epochs, yielded a test accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.97.

Experiments show that RF achieves the best performance in terms of macro harmonic mean F1 (0.59) and accuracy (0.77), and is insensitive to feature scaling. MLP follows closely behind (0.71), leveraging its nonlinear representation capabilities, but requiring regularization and data augmentation. SVM suffers from both kernel parameter limitations and small sample sizes, with accuracy dropping to 0.37. This paper proposes an improved approach for the implementation of electronic signature handwriting identification in forensic authentication, providing a replicable paradigm for small-sample signature recognition."

    "abstract": "Health systems worldwide faced extreme pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing deficits in their capacity to manage limited resources, provide service continuity, and respond to changing healthcare needs. In publicly funded systems, where financial and structural constraints are significant, ensuring hospital efficiency is essential. Technical efficiency (TE) commonly refers to how effectively a hospital utilises its available resources to deliver healthcare services, either by producing the highest possible level of services with existing resources or by using fewer resources to deliver the same services. Although many studies have applied Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate TE and identify areas for improvement, most have focused on small samples or specific periods, and national-level assessments remain limited. This study analyses the TE of 152 public Chilean hospitals between 2014 and 2023, covering both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The DEA method was used to estimate annual efficiency scores, and a machine learning model examined over 7,000 hospital-level variables per year to identify the determinants associated with TE performance. Results indicate that efficiency remained generally stable, with a temporary decline in 2020 followed by a subsequent improvement, particularly among lower-complexity hospitals. Key contributing factors included emergency services, diagnostic activities, surgical care, and organisational coordination. These findings support the use of integrated analytical approaches to monitor hospital performance and inform evidence-based health policy decisions in Chile and similar healthcare systems."

UAVs often operate in complex environments, requiring a balance between safety, efficiency, path length, and other factors. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been widely applied in this field due to its strong search capabilities. This study tested four algorithms— standard PSO, linear inertia weight PSO, PSO with added mutation particles, and Genetic Algorithm (GA)—in simulated mountainous terrains with 5, 10, and 20 peaks (representing simple, medium, and complex environments respectively), with 5 dynamic obstacles added in each environment to simulate real-world conditions. By analyzing the performance of these algorithms in terms of optimal fitness (reflecting path quality) and convergence speed (indicating computational efficiency), the research explored the applicability of traditional PSO and its improved variants in UAV path planning. The results provide a basis for selecting appropriate particle swarm algorithms for UAV path planning under different flight environments and mission requirements."

However, their predictive performance is usually limited, especially because of their low adaptability to regional and population differences, which can lead to inaccurate or biased estimates. In view of this, the present study proposes to use the electrocardiogram (ECG) as a complementary indicator for cardiovascular risk stratification. ECG signals are extracted from digitized images and processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to classify cardiac pathologies. Latent vectors are obtained from this network before the fully connected layer, and with them, the risk of each patient is estimated using a Cox regression model based on the original criteria of the Framingham study. Finally, the latent vectors and risk levels are projected into a reduced space using UMAP, revealing distinct groupings of patients that differ from those identified by the Framingham model. These findings highlight the ECG’s potential to capture physiological patterns overlooked by traditional risk equations and to enable more personalized cardiovascular risk assessment."

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently achieve strong performance in binary classification tasks, but they lack explanatory capabilities to assist physicians in interpreting the images. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as Gemini, offer potential advantages in interpretability and contextual explanation. In this work, we evaluate Gemini-2.0-flash-lite on the MHIST dataset and improve its performance through five few-shot in-context learning strategies (including random-k, KNN, and KNN+distance), exploring the impact of providing contextual support images to Gemini.

Testing was based on a physical laboratory model of 0.4 kV, implementing a prototype of a 10 kV overhead power transmission line. The test plan included four experiments: power shut down; phase A breakage; idle running; sequential switching on of the load in phases. A measuring unit of electrical energy quality parameters was additionally used to verify the data received by the contactless sensor system. The initial signals from non-contact sensors and the amplitudes of the main harmonic of these signals were used to analyze the results. The characteristic features of the response of noncontact sensors to disturbances during each experiment are described. The results obtained confirm the applicability of noncontact sensors for detecting typical events (shut-off, phase breakage, load asymmetry) on a laboratory overhead power transmission line model based on harmonic features, while simultaneously revealing limitations associated with interference in the measurement path. Based on the analysis of the experiment’s results, assumptions are made about the possibility of using a set of features for algorithms to determine changes in the operating modes of overhead power lines and further research directions are formulated."

    "abstract": "Weather radar signal fluctuation has been used to identify ground clutter (GC) from meteorological echoes for decades. Indeed, the fluctuation of a radar signal intuitively informs whether an echo comes from a static object (GC) or a random phenomenon (precipitation). Based on this intuition, Météo-France has implemented the clutter indicator, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ci</i>, which proved satisfactory to correctly identify pixels affected by GC. In this study, a revision of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ci</i>, noted Σ, is presented. The theoretical statistics (mean and variance) of Σ are then derived in the case of meteorological echoes with large spectral width and verified with both simulated and real data. As an example this result is then used to set the false alarm rate of a GC detector."

    "abstract": "While AI-based solutions have demonstrated significant benefits in enhancing the efficiency of Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), several challenges persist. One notable issue is the requirement for extensive MCS to achieve acceptable statistical uncertainty, particularly in regions far from the source. This study presents 'Scout Monte Carlo' (Scout-MC), a variance reduction technique (VRT) designed to improve AI model training and facilitate rapid simulations for medical applications, such as out-of-field dosimetry. Scout-MC builds upon forced detection approaches and extends their capabilities to estimate deposited energy specifically at the voxel of interest, regardless of its location within the phantom. The method focuses on a sampling approach to calculate the probability of a particle reaching a specific voxel. Using these probabilities and the mass energy absorption coefficient, it approximates both fluence and deposited energy. For evaluation, a voxelized multimaterial phantom was targeted with a photon beam. The results were compared with standard MCS using GATE, revealing an average relative error of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.4 \\pm 32 \\%$</tex>. Notably, Scout-MC demonstrated significantly lower and more uniform uncertainty (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.9 \\pm 0.91 \\%$</tex>) compared to standard MCS (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6 \\pm 12 \\%$</tex>). Scout-MC achieved these results in just 70 seconds, whereas GATE required 39 hours. Scout-MC can rapidly estimate the dose in any area of the image with low uncertainty and acceptable accuracy. Future work will involve extending the evaluation to more complex scenarios to further enhance accuracy and applicability."

    "abstract": "H3D, Inc. has calibrated thousands of pixelated CdZnTe (CZT) semiconductor radiation detectors for use in its products over the last ten years. Standard quality devices achieve an energy resolution of under 1.1% full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) at 662 keV, while those H3D specifies as + grade reach under 0.8% FWHM. The performance of both grades of material can be improved through waveform sampling and digital filtering. H3D's newly developed detector architecture based on a waveform-digitizing application-specific integrated circuit (digital ASIC) enables alternative event reconstruction algorithms that are better tailored to the characteristics of a particular crystal. These optimizations result in energy resolutions of 0.44% for single pixel events and 0.59% for all events at 662 keV with a high-quality crystal. Compared to historical data measured for the same crystal with an analog ASIC, the digital ASIC improves full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) by 750 eV. It also improves the full-width-at-tenth-maximum (FWTM) by 4.5 keV, resulting in more Gaussian-shaped peaks that ease quantification analysis. The detailed corrections can better compensate for material variations compared to analog ASIC electronics, delivering higher quality results from a broader range of material. Tests with two poorer-quality CZT crystals improved FWHM by 2 keV and FWTM by 8-12 keV, bringing them within the threshold defined by H3D for +-grade material. Leveraging the flexibility of the digital ASIC and customizing event processing code to tolerate lower-quality material significantly improves the yield of crystals capable of under 0.8% FWHM resolution."

Both systems were evaluated for PET performance in terms of energy resolution, coincidence resolving time (CRT), and image quality using a resolution phantom and a 3D Hoffman brain phantom. The Gen II system exhibited slightly better energy resolution (11.7 % vs. 12.05 %) and CRT (238 ps vs. 267 ps), with slight advantages in image fidelity as indicated by a higher Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.6115 compared to Gen III's 0.5903. Both systems demonstrated comparable overall performance, with Gen III showing slightly better spatial resolution based on peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) analysis of a profile through 2.8 mm hot rods of the resolution phantom (Gen II: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.003 \\pm 1.246 \\text{vs}$</tex> Gen III: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.504 \\pm 2.952$</tex>). The PVR values indicate the contrast between the peaks and valleys in the profiles, with higher values suggesting better resolution. PETcoil Gen III has a slightly higher average PVR but with greater variability, while PETcoil Gen II offers more consistent and reliable peak-to-valley performance. These results suggest that both systems offer excellent capabilities for brain imaging, with differences likely arising from variations in detector design and reconstruction parameters. Both systems are currently conducting PET-only clinical studies, with results to be presented and compared in future work"

    "abstract": "In radiotherapy, precise three-dimensional (3D) dose verification is critical for the accurate implementation of dynamic treatment plans. The scintillator-based 3D dose measurement technology, currently the most promising approach, offers the potential for high-precision realtime measurements. However, challenges such as complex system design, significant errors in solving the system response matrix, and slow iterative reconstruction algorithms have hindered the achievement of expected accuracy and real-time performance. This paper investigates the feasibility of a scintillator-based 3D dose measurement system using a conical mirror and a single camera. The study involved the development of a conical mirror tailored for the measurement system, the selection of high-quality cameras and lenses, and the assembly of the measurement setup. Experiments were conducted on a radiotherapy platform, including square-field vertical irradiation (0°), square-field oblique irradiation (30°), and real-time variable-field vertical irradiation. Preliminary results demonstrate that the conical mirror and single-camera system can effectively perform 3D dose measurements in radiotherapy. Future work will focus on advanced 3D reconstruction algorithms to further improve results, offering a novel technical solution for dynamic radiotherapy dose verification."

The HF detectors are also useful for measuring the luminosity. However, usefulness of the detectors at each end of the CMS detector depends on the correct energy calibration. Energy measurement in the HF detectors is done by collecting the Cherenkov light produced in the fibers embedded in the iron absorber. Radiation damage caused by the particles produced in the collisions will increase the light attenuation in the fibers causing to underestimate the corresponding energy. Monitoring the radiation damage as a function of eta will provide correction factors for the calibration. The new HF Online Radiation Damage Monitoring System is commissioned at the end of Run 2. It is being used since then to monitor the radiation damage of the fibers in the HF detectors. Radiation damage measurement results will be reported for the year 2022-2024 and projections will be made for the rest of the Run 3. Possible implications for the Run 4 will be discussed."

Visualizer 3D supports intelligently loading, aligning, navigating through, and selecting points on point clouds, then using this map to perform 3D Compton and coded-aperture imaging from detectors that have moved through the scene. 3D quantitative imaging algorithms will be discussed along with advances to the user interface to make interacting with the 3D scene more like a video game."

    "abstract": "Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) systems are attractive due to their excellent energy resolution as a trade-off for time-of-flight (TOF) PET capability. The high energy resolution of CZT allows improvement of signal-to-noise (SNR) by filtering scattered photons based on energy as well as increasing the number of lines of response (LORs) detected by reconstructing LORs from multiple photon interaction events (MIPEs) to increase system sensitivity. However, this requires optimizing the coincidence time resolution (CTR) in the electronic readout of CZT to accurately pair annihilation photons and related MIPEs. Here, we investigate the timing performance of the RENA-3 (Readout Electronics for Nuclear Applications) ASIC used for readout in a cross-strip edge-on CZT head and neck dual panel system built at UC Santa Cruz. Simultaneous 511 keV charge equivalent pulse injections to all channels within an ASIC show that the average relative channel-to-channel signal timing has a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 15.72 ± 0.06 ns with time resolution as good as 7.93 ± 0.10 ns FWHM. Next steps for investigating, calibrating, and optimizing CTR involve improving quadrature signal sampling and signal recovery used to determine photon arrival time, as well as characterizing channel-to-channel constant delay due to signal path lengths in the system."

This study bridges the gap by associating standardized quantitative imaging features, known as radiomics features (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R F}$</tex>), derived from medical images with established clinical frameworks such as PI-RADS, ensuring that AI models are both interpretable and aligned with clinical practice. A team comprising two medical physicists, a physician, a radiologist, and two MDs collaboratively created a radiological/biological dictionary that connects the visual semantic features of PI-RADS with radiomics features, promoting a unified understanding among medical and AI professionals. In this study, six interpretable and seven complex classifiers, paired with nine feature selection algorithms focused on risk factors, were applied to segmented lesions in multiparametric prostate MRI sequences (T2-weighted (T2WI), diffusion-weighted (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging) to predict UCLA scores. The dictionary was then used to interpret the most predictive models. By combining T2WI, DWI, and ADC with FSAs such as ANOVA F-test, Correlation Coefficient, and Fisher Score, and using logistic regression, key features were identified: the 90th percentile from T2WI, indicating hypointensity linked to prostate cancer risk; variance from T2WI, representing lesion heterogeneity; shape metrics like Least Axis Length and Surface Area to Volume ratio from ADC, describing lesion shape and compactness; and Run Entropy from ADC, which reflects texture consistency.

    "abstract": "Kernel methods incorporate prior image information into the PET forward model to improve tomographic image reconstruction. However, existing kernel-based methods are constrained to single-subject applications and rely heavily on high-quality image priors. This condition is often satisfied in dynamic imaging or in a dual-modality PET/MR, where composite longer frames or the anatomical image prior (e.g., by MRI) can serve as good image priors. In contrast, the performance of these kernel methods can be significantly compromised in static PET imaging, where no high-quality image prior exists but only a single-frame MLEM reconstruction is available. To address this challenge and expand the applicability of kernel reconstruction for static PET imaging, we propose a pretrained deep kernel method by using a large database acquired from the ultrahigh-sensitivity uEXPLORER total-body PET scanner. The resulting pretrained model can be directly applied to static PET scans for image reconstruction by using the standard MLEM reconstruction as the image prior. We conducted evaluation experiments on datasets from the uEXPLORER and GE 690 scanners and compared the proposed method with the stateof-the-art deep-learning approach that is based on a 3D denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). The results demonstrate that the proposed pretrained deep kernel model outperforms the existing approaches for improving static PET image reconstruction. This work enables the use of the kernel method for static PET with potential applications to low-dose, fast, and delayed imaging."

During an experimental campaign at the Danish Centre for Particle Therapy, 9 mice underwent targeted lung irradiation with proton beams, receiving median doses between 30 and 50 Gy (RBE). The PET scanner, developed at LMU (Germany) in collaboration with QST (Japan), comprises 56 detector blocks in a spherical layout, each with three layers of LYSO crystals providing depth-of-interaction information. To simulate PET imaging response during irradiation, a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation framework integrating positron-emitter maps from Micro-RayStation was implemented. An in-house developed software handled data streaming, data processing, and image reconstruction, enabling quasi-real-time feedback from the PET system. Both simulated and acquired PET images were co-registered with a fixed CT image, accounting for translation and rotation of the mouse holder between pencil-beam spots via a novel reconstruction algorithm that included sensitivity and motion corrections. Preliminary analysis revealed promising agreement between predicted and measured PET signals. The system also captured washout dynamics of positron-emitting isotopes in quasi-real-time, offering valuable insights into the biological response of irradiated tissue. These findings highlight the precision of online PET-based range verification in pre-clinical proton therapy. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating in-vivo PET imaging with proton irradiation, enabling quasi-real-time monitoring and supporting the development of advanced molecular image-guided radiotherapy for pre-clinical research."

While PET imaging provides precise BAT quantification via standardized uptake values (SUV), its use remains costly and invasive. A recent approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict BAT activity from CT scans has shown potential, but it relies on large datasets and sometimes suffers from limited generalizability. In this work, we investigate a novel, data-efficient alternative using Gaussian Splatting-a neural scene representation technique originally developed for real-time rendering and recently adapted to medical imaging. We first train a dual-channel Gaussian model on a single CT/PET pair. For new patients, this Gaussian representation is fine-tuned using only the CT image. Preliminary results suggest that the model captures general PET structure and some BAT regions, despite limitations due to CT-only supervision. Upcoming work will incorporate prior-guided learning to improve anatomical accuracy and generalization."

Despite their promise, existing general-purpose MLMs often fail to consistently provide accurate and clinically relevant information. Even if domainspecific MLMs are developed at select research institutions, they are likely inaccessible to the broader clinical community for use in practice, due to barriers such as the need for programming expertise, lack of access to high-performance computers, and the impracticality of keyboard-based interaction within hands-occupied clinical workflows. To address this gap, we propose a modular MLM framework designed to improve accessibility, usability, and clinical relevance of MLMs for practitioners in radiation oncology. Our framework offers three key features: (1) a web-based deployment, making it broadly accessible via any internet-connected computer; (2) Integrated voice input and text-to-speech output modules enable clinicians to interact with the AI system hands-free, accommodating scenarios in which manual keyboard use is impractical; (3) our framework currently supports several pre-trained general-purpose MLM modules, with the capacity to incorporate additional domain-specific MLMs in future iterations. By lowering the barrier to experiencing advanced MLMs, our modular framework aims to increase clinician familiarity with emerging AI tools and accelerate their translation into routine clinical practice."

The Electron Tracking Compton Camera (ETCC) consisting of a time projection chamber (TPC) as the scatterer and pixel scintillator arrays (PSAs) as absorbers, measures not only the scattered gamma rays but also the recoil electron from the Compton scattering point, which reduces the Compton circle to an arc. The ETCC offers several advantages, such as significant background reduction and hence achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio, compared with other types of Compton cameras. The performance of the precise electron tracking clearly affects the final reconstructed images. Among several key issues, we have focused on ambiguity in determination of the recoil electron's initial momentum direction and the scattering point. For this purpose, we have conducted measurements using the ETCC, where the PSAs were placed in the direction with the angle of dozens of degrees to accumulate the Compton scattering events with relatively long track length. The obtained track images range from a relatively straight line shape to a complicated pattern that is caused by the multiple scattering effect and it suggests that implementing a suitable filter may improve the tracking accuracy. In order to evaluate the uncertainty of the determination of the Compton scattering point from the track images, a Monte Carlo simulation tool has been developed for the ETCC detector system."

Radiation detection with highly precise timing performance is important along with the evolution of scintillators and photodetectors to maximize exploratory and diagnostic capabilities. In our previous study, Cherenkov radiator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (CRI-MCP-PMTs) were developed, and a coincidence time resolution (CTR) of a pair of them achieved 30 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM). However, the CRI-MCP-PMT focused solely on timing performance, and other important characteristics as a radiation detector, e.g., detection sensitivity and energy resolution, were compromised.

    "abstract": "The emergence of live streaming has revolutionized retail, altering how e-tailers engage with their customers. However, incorporating a live streaming channel may intensify channel competition and profit-sharing losses, potentially eroding the e-tailer's overall profitability. A streamer faces a trade-off in contract provision: it must balance maximizing its profits with expanding its market. This paper investigates a streamer's contract offering decisions and an e-tailer's channel selection strategy. We analyze two types of contracts that a streamer can offer—agency and reselling contracts—and three channel strategies for an e-tailer: not adopting live streaming, self-streaming, and third-party streaming. Our findings reveal that the streamer offers contracts aligned with its profit preferences only when the network effect is strong and the hassle cost is low. Otherwise, the streamer may deviate from its preferred contract and choose a suboptimal strategy. From the e-tailer's perspective, no single strategy dominates all scenarios. The e-tailer should avoid opening a live-streaming channel when the hassle cost is very high. If the network effect is low and the hassle cost is moderately high, the e-tailer should choose self-streaming; otherwise, it should opt for third-party streaming. Interestingly, our research also shows that neither the e-tailer nor the streamer necessarily has to lower the live streaming channel price. Furthermore, implementing live-streaming does not always cannibalize the traditional channel demand or lead to an expansion of total market demand. This paper provides practical guidance for both streamers and e-tailers in making strategic contract and channel decisions in the live-streaming retail landscape."

    "abstract": "Mobile tomosynthesis enables quasi-tomographic imaging using a limited projection angle range, offering diagnostic advantages in settings such as home care and nursing facilities. However, since mobile systems are manually positioned for each scan, accurate geometric calibration between the x-ray source and detector is essential for image reconstruction. Existing calibration methods require additional scans, then we propose a novel geometric calibration method that requires no additional scans. By attaching a board with pin-shaped reference markers to the detector, the proposed method estimates the x-ray source location by analyzing the gravity centers and directions of the projected markers. Numerical simulations varying marker sizes and materials were conducted to evaluate the proposed method accuracy. Results show that marker thickness significantly affects gravity center accuracy, while material type does not. X-ray source position was more accurately calibrated in the xz plane than in the xy plane, due to a theoretical discrepancy in projected center alignment. Reconstructed images confirmed effective separation of overlapping structures. The proposed approach simplifies mobile tomosynthesis calibration, enhancing accessibility and utility in clinical and non-clinical environments. Future work includes correcting the projected center discrepancy to improve xy plane accuracy."

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) have gained significant popularity for modeling complex, nonlinear systems due to their powerful approximation capabilities. However, designing an appropriate network structure and tuning parameters remains challenging, especially for nonlinear dynamic systems where offline training data are unavailable and poor approximations from badly tuned NNs can cause instability. This article presents a novel adaptive frequency-based constructive wavelet NN (AFBCWNN) for tracking reference trajectories for a class of unknown nonlinear dynamic systems. Using online measurements, the AFBCWNN integrates adaptive weight updating, adjustable network structures, and rigorous stability analysis using Lyapunov techniques. Unlike conventional methods, the proposed AFBCWNN leverages frequency-domain analysis to estimate the energy distribution of the unknown nonlinear mapping from measured data. This frequency-based approach provides a uniform design guideline for network initialization, enabling the network to dynamically add wavelet bases when the desired accuracy is not achieved and prune nonenergy-active (low-energy) bases, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. Rigorous stability analysis establishes conditions for uniformly bounded trajectories, and simulation results confirm the AFBCWNN’s superior performance in capturing complex, nonlinear dynamics compared to the existing adaptive methods."

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have widely used in semantic segmentation, and can effectively extract local hierarchical information while being unsatisfactory in extracting global information. By contrast, Transformer is good at extracting long-distance dependencies in semantics while it is time-consuming. In this work, we propose a Light CNN-Transformer Dual-Branch Network (LCTDBNet) for real-time semantic segmentation. It consists of a longer CNN branch to extract local hierarchical information and a shorter Transformer branch to extract global contextual information. The CNN branch uses a lightweight encoder-decoder structure to further extract more local hierarchical information. We propose a Deep Strip Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DSAPPM) to extract contextual and strip information. We further propose a Feature Pooling Refinement Module (FPRM) to optimise the feature representation at different stages. Finally, we propose a CNN-Transformer Fusion Module (CTFM) to fuse the features of two branches. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LCTDBNet is effective and achieves satisfactory results. Specifically, the base version of LCTDBNet achieves 80.3% mean intersection over union (mIoU) at 78.6 frames per second (FPS) on Cityscapes, 80.0% mIoU at 137.5 FPS on CamVid and 40.9% mIoU at 253.7 FPS on ADE20 K."

To cope with the stringent latency, mobility, and energy budgets of UAV swarms, this work proposes Blockchain- and Ring-signature-empowered Federated Learning (BRFL), a privacy-preserving framework tailored to aerial networks. BRFL uses a decentralized ledger for auditing and storage, and a no-pairing elliptic curve ring signature to anonymize client uploads by forming a random UAV ring each round. Smart contracts further verify the signatures and invoke a lightweight ring-internal supervision voting mechanism to filter malicious updates. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that BRFL converges stably on non-IID data even when 40% of UAVs behave Byzantinely. Theoretical analysis further bounds the adversary’s cross-round-linking probability by (1/<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>)<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>T</i></sup> .

To achieve higher shifting quality and streamline the development, this study investigates the torque lever-based gear-shifting strategy of a novel three-speed transmission for EVs. Initially, a novel powertrain based on a 3-speed Ravigneaux transmission is proposed as the foundation for the transient analysis of gear shifting. Meanwhile, the equivalence of the idealized gear arrangements in Ravigneaux gearsets is demonstrated. Based on the analysis, we employ the Torque Lever Approach (TLA) to design 3 power-on shift control strategies according to different torque controls. This approach features less theory computation than algebra. Subsequently, the hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) validates all the strategies for upshift and downshift between adjacent and nonadjacent gears. The results show the effectiveness of the strategies designed by TLA, and their features are discussed in these shifting conditions."

This is important, since we need to perform dynamic plant studies for multiple hours as the roots and soil slowly uptake and metabolize 11C gas. To correct for detector gain shifts, an energy peak alignment algorithm was applied across all modules, improving global energy resolution from 15.00 ± 0.28 % to 11.95 ± 0.18 % (FWHM at 511 keV). The energy resolution remained stable throughout the study, with a standard deviation of only 0.0124, and the coincidence count rate averaged 7.79 × 103 counts per 30 -minute segment with less than 5% variation.

    "abstract": "Point cloud filtering serves as a core step in point cloud data processing, which is critical for constructing high-precision Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and conducting terrain monitoring. However, existing filtering methods encounter two key challenges. First, they exhibit strong reliance on threshold parameters and limited adaptability, necessitating manual parameter adjustment to suit different scenarios—this often results in misclassification or under-classification of ground and non-ground points. Second, their adaptability to complex terrains is inadequate: in regions with drastic slope variations or dense buildings, issues such as the loss of terrain details or confusion between terrain points and feature point clouds frequently arise, making it difficult for a single method to meet the requirements of diverse application scenarios. To address this problem, this article proposes a multi-scale mesh fitting filtering based on adaptive clustering segmentation and gradient compensation. First, the existing clustering segmentation algorithm is improved to propose an adaptive clustering segmentation method. Then, by combining Delaunay triangulation and local feature parameters, an outlier cluster is constructed. On the basis of the clustering segmentation results and the distribution of outliers, the building feature areas are effectively separated. After that, grids are constructed by separating the point clouds of the building clusters. The point clouds within the grids are judged by using planes and slope angles to remove most non-ground points, and establishes a secondary grid. The elevation threshold is determined on the basis of the fitted grids and gradient compensation. Finally, carrying out a secondary check according to the cluster edges obtained by clustering. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has wide applicability without the need to switch feature parameters, and its filtering accuracy is significantly higher than that of existing methods in most point cloud scenarios."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous services such as broadband and latency-constrained internet-of-things (IoT), with diverse requirements, make efficient resource sharing challenging. Two canonical strategies are radio access network (RAN) Slicing, which allocates disjoint resources per service, and RAN Sharing, where services coexist on a common resource. Under either regime, grant-free repetition-based access is a key enabler of IoT connectivity prompting latency-aware policies tuned to the regimes’ density and interference profiles. Prior work on repetition-policy optimisation mainly employs base station (BS)-centric reinforcement learning (RL) or irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA)-based approaches focused on throughput/packet loss rate (PLR) in asymptotic regimes. The former requires central orchestration, leading to high control overhead and reduced adaptability; the latter typically degrades when targeting performance at finite frame lengths. This motivates decentralised multi-agent RL (MARL), where each IoT device learns its own policy to meet latency targets in dense, finite frame-length, mixed-service deployments. To this end, we investigate an uplink scenario where a broadband user coexists with multiple latency-constrained IoT devices employing grant-free access. We formulate IoT access policy optimisation as a decentralised, model-free MARL problem, enabling devices to learn their transmission strategies under finite frame length structures and strict latency requirements. Under both RAN Slicing and RAN Sharing regimes, the proposed scheme outperforms baseline decentralised approaches; in each regime it achieves substantial IoT latency gains while sustaining broadband throughput and energy efficiency (EE). Furthermore, the results highlight and compare regime-specific trade-offs."

To address these issues, we introduce GroundedContrastive Decoding (GCD), a novel training-free framework. GCD integrates a lightweight disentanglement module in the latent space with a multimodal contrastive decoding strategy that actively suppresses language priors. This approach reduces object, attribute, and relational hallucinations while preserving general visual understanding, yielding substantial gains on benchmarks such as MME, MM-Vet, and MMMU."

To address this, we propose a cluster-based automated I/O analysis approach. This approach constructs two types of clustering objects, intra-job and inter-job, and designs multi-dimensional I/O features to characterize them. The Clustering results are mapped onto the workflow structure for intuitive I/O pattern identification. We conduct a case study on real scientific workflow, demonstrating that our method can effectively identify job clusters with similar I/O behaviors. In particular, we can automatically detect data transfer patterns such as aggregation and broadcast in workflow, which pinpoint the I/O bottlenecks.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (WS-TFL) seeks to pinpoint the start and end timestamps of manipulated segments within untrimmed videos using only modality-level labels. However, the absence of fine-grained annotations poses a significant challenge: how to effectively extract and utilize informative cues from limited supervision to bridge the gap between training and testing. To address this issue, we propose a pseudo label-driven framework, termed Two-branch Boundary Map Consistency Network (TBMCN). The framework is composed of two synergistic components. First, the Pseudo Boundary Map Generation (PBMG) branch capitalizes on frame-level prior knowledge derived from pre-trained models, and produces reliable pseudo labels through a Forgery Attention Selector (FAS) and a Forgery Attention Filter (FAF). Second, the Actual Boundary Map Prediction (ABMP) branch exploits intrinsic modal-level temporal relations within the video via a cross-attention mechanism and a self-attention module, yielding forgery localization predictions. Consistency constraints are imposed between the two branches to harmonize information across different granularities. The pseudo labels generated during training serve as intermediate products to narrow the training-testing discrepancy.In addition, we introduce a Boundary Sensitivity Module (BSM) to compel the model to generate a strong response at the temporal forgery boundary by ensuring temporal invariance in predictions across different real contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on the LAV-DF dataset validate the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving 46.9 for AP@0.5.

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has emerged as a method for non-invasively assessing glymphatic flow from magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted images. This index has been applied to the study of neurodegenerative and other brain disorders. It has been found to decrease in most studies of neurodegenerative conditions. Decreases in DTI-ALPS also have been found in healthy adults with age. Changes by sex are less consistently observed but seem to suggest females have higher indices. We explored in a healthy adult cohort whether DTI-ALPS is affected by age and sex, or serves as a surrogate/biomarker of the presence of early, covert small vessel disease (SVD) (white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, microbleeds or enlarged perivascular spaces), and vascular risk factors (VRFs) like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or smoking. Separate linear regressions found a slower decrease in DTI-ALPS with age in females than males (-0.0034±0.0013 units/year vs -0.0048 ±0.0011 units/year, p<0.020 between slopes). DTI-ALPS was associated with SVD in one-way ANOVA testing (F=4.72, p=0.032) but not the presence of one or more VRFs (F=0.955, p=0.330). However, in a multivariable linear model only age was significant (-0.0041 units/year, p = 0.007). The other examined factors (sex, presence of SVD or VRF, and age×sex interaction) were all not significant. In conclusion, only older age was significantly associated with lower DTI-ALPS, suggesting a reduction in glymphatic flow with age. However, male sex, the presence of mild-to-moderate SVD pathology nor VRFs were linked to decreased glymphatic flow in a sample drawn from healthy community-dwelling adults."

In this work, we introduce FedSCS, a novel aggregation framework built around a new client trust score: Stable Cosine Similarity (SCS). This metric captures both geometric alignment and temporal stability, enabling dynamic and interpretable trust assessment. FedSCS is fully unsupervised, hyperparameter-free, and computationally efficient, avoiding pairwise operations and external validation data. We evaluate the method on CIFAR-10 classification and DOTA-v1 object detection under clean, non-IID, and noisy-client settings. Across all scenarios, FedSCS consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher test accuracy in the most challenging regimes."

In this paper, a time-space dual flow architecture and dynamic cue generation combined with the SAM segmentation model were proposed, and the crop phenological stages were coded as spatial heat maps to segment. The method guided SAM to pay attention to sensitive areas, integrated the temporal difference map and phenological heat map, and dynamically selected the cue type (point/frame/mask) according to the growth stage to improve segmentation accuracy."

Its effectiveness, however, depends on the careful alignment of student digital readiness, institutional strategies, and internationally recognized frameworks. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis that brings together multiple perspectives: global policy insights from OECD surveys, conceptual contributions from Russian scholarship emphasizing humanistic values, student perspectives from Indian higher education, and the structural guidance of the UNESCO Six Pillars framework. The study argues that meaningful transformation requires bridging policy, institutional practices, and student experiences through a human-centred and evidence-based approach. Findings reveal that while governments and institutions are investing heavily in infrastructure and digital strategies, persistent gaps remain in student digital literacy, teacher preparedness, parental involvement, and sustainable financing. By synthesizing international evidence, the paper develops a multi-level model linking student readiness with institutional strategies and global frameworks, offering practical recommendations for policymakers, educators, and stakeholders to ensure a sustainable and equitable digital transformation in education."

It shows the model with stemming reached an 81.98% accuracy and F1-score 0.81, compared to the version without stemming, which had an accuracy 79.65% and an F1-score 0.73. In addition, stemming improved the model's capability in detecting positive sentiment, especially in unbalanced datasets. These findings suggest that stemming can improve sentiment classification performance in morphologically rich languages such as Indonesian. These results highlight the significance of adapting preprocessing strategies for the language characteristics in the dataset, and they suggest that stemming should not be universally excluded in transformer-based NLP tasks for non-English languages. This research provides new insight into improving sentiment analysis performance in low-resource."

However, students often face various barriers in contributing that cause them to not engage further, which emphasizes the importance of strategies to reduce student dropout in OSS projects. This study investigates the impact of personalized gamification on student motivation and engagement in OSS projects. By applying the Hexad Framework, game elements were tailored to match diverse student preferences, creating a more engaging and supportive OSS contribution experience. An evaluation was conducted involving students in real OSS projects to examine their engagement and motivation toward both the projects and the environments. Through semi-structured interviews, the results show that personalized gamified environments can maintain engagement by facilitating the onboarding process of students into OSS projects and motivating them using elements that match their individual preferences, such as points, achievements/badges, and leaderboards. Although intrinsic aspects still play a role in motivating students, gamification elements are able to motivate students with different player types in OSS projects. These findings suggest using gamification as a strategy in OSS projects to retain new contributors, particularly among students."

    "abstract": "The underwater acoustic channel exhibits multipath effects, propagation loss, and Doppler frequency shift that are far more significant than those in radio communication, making them key issues to be addressed. In this paper, a simulation model of a multi-user direct sequence spread spectrum communication system based on the underwater acoustic channel is built using the Simulink platform. Through the simulation results of this model, the bit error rate (BER) and transmission rate of basic digital modulation modes under the underwater acoustic channel are analyzed. The simulation results show that when the number of users increases, the BER of 2PSK rises significantly, while the deterioration of 2FSK is milder due to its frequency diversity characteristic. When SNR $\\gt0 \\mathrm{~dB}$, 2PSK performs better in scenarios with a small number of users ($\\boldsymbol{\\leq} \\mathbf{3}$ users), but multi-user interference will damage phase coherence. The hybrid scheme of frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA) can significantly improve the antiinterference capability of 2 FSK. By setting a 10 kHz carrier interval to form a guard band, the multi-user BER is effectively reduced."

The platform combines multimedia content including videos, case studies, and reflection prompts with key learning objects such as a lesson plan, handout, and slide presentation. Grounded in life-based and humanistic education principles, the model aims to enhance empathy, ethical reasoning, and mental resilience. Expert evaluations from both media and material specialists gave scores mostly 3 (good) and 4 (very good) across assessed aspects. According to the interpretive scale (3.1–4.0 = Very High), the developed media and materials fall into the \"Very High Worth Using\" category. The highest scores were achieved in usefulness, interactivity, and motivation, indicating that the Google Classroom–based materials meet core expectations of interactive, human-centric learning. Slightly lower scores (3) were recorded for visual contrast, colour combination, font readability, and integration across handout, slide, and assessment tools, signalling areas for refinement especially in the slide presentation and visual design to optimise learner experience. These results confirm the platform’s potential to deliver meaningful and scalable human-centric professional education in the public sector. Future research should focus on measuring learning outcomes and the long-term effects of this training on civil servant behaviour and well-being."

This research aims to address this issue by developing a lemmatization algorithm tailored specifically for Uzbek open compound words, which are underrepresented in existing NLP resources. The method relies on a dictionary-based approach supported by a finite-state machine (FSM) to recognize and normalize compound words without requiring prior tokenization. The compiled lexicon includes over 900 compound units across various parts of speech, including verbs, adverbs, pronouns, interjections, and auxiliary verb constructions. Evaluation of the algorithm on structured textual data demonstrates its ability to accurately identify compound forms and map them to their base lemmas with high precision. The approach does not require large annotated corpora or complex machine learning models, making it transparent, reproducible, and adaptable for resource-scarce languages. These findings highlight the potential of rule-based lexical methods combined with finite-state modeling in improving lemmatization performance and suggest promising directions for further development of NLP tools for the Uzbek language and other agglutinative languages with similar structural characteristics."

The framework incorporates a standardized skill library construction method based on inclusion relations and semantic similarity, combined with a hybrid label sampling strategy, achieving effective skill completion for resume enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that LEGSP significantly outperforms baseline methods in both prediction accuracy.

By integrating bicubic interpolation, the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) algorithm, and a luminance correction model, the proposed method enhances both the detail visibility and overall visual quality of acoustic images. The bicubic interpolation preserves high-frequency details, CLAHE enhances local contrast, while the luminance correction model accurately adjusts non-uniform illumination. This collaborative processing mechanism significantly improves both detail visibility and overall visual quality of the images, demonstrating superior performance in both objective metrics and subjective evaluations. Furthermore, a pool experiment was conducted in which a multibeam sonar mounted on a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) was used to acquire acoustic images of underwater targets. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the Histogram Equalization (HE) algorithm, CLAHE algorithm, Relative Global Histogram Stretching (RGHS) algorithm, Block-Matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithm, Rayleigh algorithm, and Singal Scale Retinex (SSR) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed image enhancement technique not only improves the overall image quality but also preserves the richness of image details and the integrity of information, showcasing its comprehensive enhancement capabilities."

    "abstract": "Underground potash mines present many challenging work areas, some of which have low heights. These conditions pose significant challenges for manufacturers of adjustable speed drives, as their cabinets tend to be taller at larger power ratings. This height issue often results in the installation of drives with long cable lengths between the drives and their motors. Over time, this can lead to damaging dV/dt voltage spikes impacting the motor windings. A potential solution to these specific low-height areas is the implementation of a modular drive system housed within a mining sled. This technical paper presents an in-depth analysis of such a system, specifically installed on a highspeed loadout conveyor belt within an underground potash mine located in Saskatchewan, Canada. The study’s primary focus is on the replacement of existing adjustable speed drives and switched reluctance motors. The new installation features a modular drive system and standard induction motors, all operating on a common drive pulley. The paper provides details of the technical specifications of the modular drive system.

    "abstract": "The issue of lake water safety has become increasingly prominent. Although traditional water quality monitoring methods such as cluster analysis are widely used, there is strong nonlinearity and randomness among water quality parameters, making it difficult to meet the requirements of precise monitoring. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is widely used in the modeling of nonlinear systems, but it has the problem of serious time-consuming training for large samples. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can enhance computational efficiency through dimensionality reduction. To this end, this paper proposes the PCA-SVM algorithm, aiming to combine the advantages of both to optimize the monitoring effect of abnormal water quality. The study takes the water quality operation data collected by the coastal monitoring stations in China since January 2016 as the experimental dataset. This dataset contains 13 feature dimensions and 2,880 samples, and the linear correlation of the samples is poor, which meets the requirements of multi-dimensional nonlinear datasets. The experiment compared the PCA-SVM model with the traditional K-means model to evaluate the model performance in terms of monitoring accuracy and computational efficiency. The training of the Kmeans model took 6.3625 seconds. According to the \"Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water\" (GB 3838-2002), among the 144 outliers monitored, only 94 were actually outliers, with an accuracy rate of only 65.28%. The training time of the PCA-SVM model is only 1.0375 seconds, which is 83.69% shorter than that of the K-means model. A total of 143 outliers were detected in the same dataset. After standard determination, 106 actual outliers were found, with an accuracy rate of 74.13%, which was approximately 8.85 percentage points higher than that of the K-means model. Studies show that the PCA-SVM model ingeniously combines the dimensionality reduction advantage of PCA with the dynamic monitoring ability of SVM. It is significantly superior to the traditional K-means method in both computational efficiency and monitoring accuracy, and can provide more powerful technical support for water quality detection. However, there is still room for improvement in the accuracy of this model. In the future, further exploration of optimization paths can be conducted to enhance the precision of alerts."

The purpose of this paper is to analyze known entropy codes, allowing to simplify the choice of a method for a specific data compression system, paying special attention to the transmission of video and audio signals. We show that letter-wise entropy codes can be useful only for small blocks of letters.So we focus our analysis on stream codes, namely, arithmetic coding, range coding and asymmetric numeral systems coding. The Huffman code is used as a point to comparison.The carried out analysis allows us to develop recommendations that significantly simplify the practical application of entropy codes and their subsequent assessment. We start with binary codes which are widely used in audio and video compression and then show thatlarge alphabet codes can provide a noticeable increase in coding speed, at least for the case of small source memory."

Document formats within BSN exhibit considerable variability, with more than 40 templates currently in use. To address this challenge, this study introduces a rule-based automation framework utilizing Document Layout Analysis (DLA). The proposed heuristic approach extracts and classifies data blocks (forms, tables, and paragraphs) from Excel files, and subsequently maps and populates them into Microsoft Word templates. The evaluation, conducted on 10 authentic BSN calibration documents obtained from three distinct laboratories, demonstrated a 100% F1-score in identifying Region of Interest (ROI). Furthermore, the extraction of Entity of Interest (EOI) achieved a precision of 94.4%, with a single failure arising from the handling of a multi-line form structure. These findings indicate that the proposed DLA-based method provides a robust foundation for advancing BSN’s implementation of Level 2 DCC standards."

The proposed method is distinguished by the fact that the limit values of the indicators are determined by minimizing the mean risk function for several oil indicators that are stochastically interrelated, using the Nelder-Mead method. A comparative analysis showed that the use of limit values obtained through the proposed method allows risk reduction by a factor of 1.2 to 7.8 compared to the risks associated with using the limit values specified in the standards IEC 60599:2022, IEEE Std C57.106-2015, and SOU-N EE 43-101:2009 for 110 kV transformers and 330 kV autotransformers. Moreover, the limit values obtained by minimizing the risk function for two indicators are accompanied by risk levels 1.3 to 23.7 times lower than those associated with the use of limit values also obtained by the minimum risk method, but for one-dimensional distributions. The obtained results indicate the high reliability of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "In response to the current challenges in coral monitoring and conservation, this paper proposes a lightweight underwater coral detection algorithm—SCoralESC—designed to tackle detection difficulties such as color shift, low contrast, small object size, and target occlusion in complex underwater environments. The method replaces the traditional YOLO11n backbone with EfficientNet to enhance fine-grained feature representation; it introduces a SlimNeck module that integrates the VoV GSCSP structure and GSConv lightweight convolution to achieve efficient multi-scale feature fusion and discriminative feature generation. Additionally, the CARAFE content-aware upsampling module is incorporated to improve small object detection performance while preserving spatial details. Ablation studies and model comparisons were conducted on a coral dataset collected in Sanya, China (comprising six coral categories, 1,204 images, and 2,838 annotated instances). SCoralESC demonstrates superior overall performance in terms of GFLOPs, Precision, Recall, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95, with a particularly notable mAP@50:95 of 0.593, outperforming models such as YOLOv8n, YOLOv10n, YOLO12n, and RT-DETR. These results highlight the model’s outstanding capabilities in small object recognition, computational efficiency, and deployment feasibility. The proposed model is well-suited for real-time, large-scale coral ecosystem monitoring and long-term marine ecological research tasks."

The antenna, based on a 3 mm-thick aluminum composite panel, was manufactured using computer numerical control milling, and its performance was validated through near-field measurements. The results demonstrate a high gain, exceeding 35 dBi at the center frequency and above 32 dBi across the entire band, with side lobe levels below -15 dB and cross-polarization discrimination better than 15.5 dB.

Over more than an existence century, shadow devices have become widely used to solve this problem. Hilbert optics is an optics branch that uses the Hilbert transform over functions of two spatial coordinates on a plane. The Hilbert transform made it possible to visualize optical inhomogeneities with extremely high contrast simultaneously for all spatial frequencies transmitted by the optical system, in contrast to the Foucault-Hilbert transform, which is implemented using the amplitude \"Foucault knife\". Also, the Hilbert optics elements are simple in design, have high noise immunity when handled carelessly, and the visualization images of optical inhomogeneities can be easily interpreted by an operator without special training. However, Hilbert diagnostics has not received due distribution to date, despite the indicated advantages. A visual comparison of the two research methods under consideration using numerical models as an example is performed in this paper. Mathematical justifications for the Hilbert and Foucault-Hilbert transforms are given. Some applied tasks that were accomplished using Hilbert visualization and are difficult to implement using the classical shadow method are noted in the conclusion."

    "abstract": "The Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model has gained wide-spread application due to its powerful heterogeneous graph information processing capabilities. However, extant methods frequently neglect fine-grained relationship interactions in graphs and encounter difficulties in simultaneously capturing low-order and high-order semantic features. In order to address this issue, the present paper proposes a dual-channel heterogeneous graph neural network model (RMPC-HGNN) based on relationship-meta-path collaborative interaction. The model first calculates dynamic attention weights within the relationship subgraph by integrating source node features, target node features, and edge features. This enables cross-node-type semantic-aware message passing. Secondly, the model facilitates interaction between different relational subgraphs through an attention weight fusion mechanism. Concurrently, the GATv2Conv operator is applied on the metapath subgraph to capture node interactions within paths, and a semantic attention mechanism is employed to fuse multi-path features. Subsequently, the model introduces learnable parameters to dynamically balance the output features of the relationship channel and meta-path channel, and generates the final node representations through L2 norm normalization. Node classification experiments on three real-world heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that RMPC-HGNN significantly outperforms existing baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Digital images are widely used in many technologies that are an integral part of various systems. Compared to other types of data, their specific feature is a relatively large size that restricts the use of different machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) methods. A large data processing time and image spatial complexity become additional blockers for applying many ML and CV algorithms if real-time results are required or if the main computations must be performed on autonomous systems with limited capabilities. For this reason, the problem of the development of a compact image representation, which contains features useful in ML/CV techniques, is relevant. In this paper, we consider the use of discrete atomic transform (DAT) based on atomic functions for solving this problem. Our previous investigation had proven that DAT provided a combination of data compression and encryption features. This research shows that DAT representation is ML/CV-oriented with respect to image classification using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks. Thus, its application in different methods for image analysis is promising."

After that, a federated GCN-GRU architecture to facilitate distributed training and mitigate risks associated with data centralization. Evaluations across multiple regional power datasets reveal that our model reduces the MAE by 19.9%, 28.2%, and 37.4% compared to the existing methods, which provides a novel approach for collaborative multi-regional load forecasting."

    "abstract": "QR codes have become a ubiquitous tool in modern society, widely used in mobile payments, authentication, marketing, and e-government services; however, their increasing adoption has also introduced new security challenges, as attackers exploit QR codes to distribute malicious software, conduct phishing attacks (QRishing), and steal sensitive user data. Since the first reported malicious QR code attack in 2011, the number and sophistication of such threats have steadily grown, particularly targeting smartphones and other mobile devices. Existing protection mechanisms, including URL verification tools, visual markers, and traditional cryptographic methods, often fail to provide a comprehensive and scalable solution, making advanced defense strategies essential. This paper provides a systematic overview of current QR code security threats and countermeasures, with a particular focus on cryptographic approaches and machine learning-based detection methods, while critically analyzing the limitations of existing solutions. Furthermore, we propose a secure architectural framework that integrates modern cryptographic algorithms with intelligent threat detection to achieve a balance between security, performance, and usability, thereby enhancing the resilience of QR codes against emerging attacks. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on mobile security and highlight the necessity of robust, scalable mechanisms for protecting future applications."

    "abstract": "Prediction intervals are critical for quantifying uncertainty in regression tasks, yet many standard methods such as Locart and Loforest often yield suboptimal results on small, complex datasets. This paper addresses the following research question: Can the integration of advanced off-the-shelf models, specifically XGBoost and Stacking Regression, within a conformal prediction framework, improve the reliability and precision of prediction intervals for used car price estimation? Unlike prior work, this study does not propose a new theoretical framework or algorithm, but rather provides a transparent, empirical comparison of established methods. The rationale for selecting XGBoost is its proven ability to handle mixed data types, regularize against overfitting, and efficiently model nonlinear relationships. Stacking Regression is included for its meta-learning capability, combining strengths of multiple base models. The evaluation uses Conditional Coverage Absolute Deviation (CCAD), Standard Mean Interval Score (SMIS), and Coverage Percentage, with bootstrapped confidence intervals and paired t-tests to assess statistical significance. Results show that while XGBoost and Stacking Regression can reduce CCAD and SMIS compared to Locart and Loforest, the improvements are not always statistically significant due to the small sample size (n=150). The study also discusses time complexity, sensitivity to noise, and robustness to outliers. Overall, this work is best categorized as an incremental application study, highlighting tradeoffs between precision and coverage, and providing practical guidance for practitioners rather than introducing methodological innovation."

These findings highlight trade offs between accuracy and speed, and provide practical insights for deploying AI-based wildlife monitoring systems under real-world conditions."

    "abstract": "As cheating in games has developed, various plug-in programs that rely on technological progress have emerged. These programmes involve illegal data tampering, thereby disrupting the fair competitive environment of the game. This article focuses on game data security and introduces the Multi-Modal Semantic Collaborative Attention Fusion Model (MSCAFM). The model extracts image and label features through a specific backbone network. It then employs the Multi-Modal Feature-Aligned Fusion Attention (MFAF) and Adaptive Residual Gathering Fusion (ARGF) modules to achieve feature fusion. Finally, it transforms the features through a multilayer perceptron. This allows the model to fully learn the features for securing the verification of game data. MSCAFM’s most significant contribution is its use of the MFAF attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of multimodal features and capture complex intra-modal relationships. This effectively enhances the model’s ability to express the features of multimodal data, providing better processing capabilities. Experimental results also validate the effectiveness of the proposed MSCAFM. On the Minecraft Screenshots Dataset, its area under the curve (AUC) is 0.8961 and its accuracy (ACC) is $92.73 \\%$."

In this analysis, the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Algorithm was used. This study applied the FastICA technique with the assumption that compost, irrigation, and microbes are hidden factors that influence nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH levels. The research stage used preprocessing, centering, and whitening techniques to normalize the data. The analysis results show the distribution of independent components that successfully separate the influence of these hidden factors. This study also calculated the kurtosis and negentropy values for each component, and visualized them with scatter plots and heat maps to identify correlations between ICA components and observed variables. The first plot depicting the relationship between IC1 and IC2 shows a positive pattern indicating a correlation between the two components, with a correlation coefficient of 0.824. The second plot depicting the relationship between IC2 and IC3 also shows a positive pattern, although this relationship is weaker with a correlation coefficient of 0.375. This scatter plot illustrates the distribution of data points that show a linear relationship between components, helping in identifying clearer patterns in the separated data."

It is proposed that the main reason for the difference in magnetoresistive properties between Bi88.08Mn11.92 and Bi95.69Mn3.69Fe0.62 is the effect of the intrinsic magnetism of the Į-BiMn inclusions, which significantly affects the transport behavior of electrons and holes within the bismuth-based matrix."

When deriving the main analytical relationships for calculating the characteristics of the proposed resonant magnetic-pulse complex designed to attract sheet metals and operating as a resonant amplifier of the energy of an electric signal from an industrial voltage and frequency network, the mathematical apparatus of the theoretical foundations of electrical engineering and methods of integrating differential equations were used.

The method employs Gaussian pyramids for spatial feature integration and adversarial examples during training to improve generalization. Evaluations on six benchmark datasets (LOL, LIME, MEF, DICM, HDR, NEP) show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a PSNR of 23.02 and SSIM of 0.867 on LOL, and the lowest NIQE (3.320) across all comparisons.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, particularly in domains requiring up-todate and precise information. However, conventional RAG approaches often fail in safety-critical industrial domains like aviation, where documents possess rigid hierarchical structures (e.g., Technical Instruction Manuals(TIMs)). These exhibit contextual disintegration, resulting in semantic ambiguity, overspecialization, and critical hallucination risks. This paper introduces DeepPerception-RAG, a novel framework designed to address these limitations by integrating document hierarchy awareness directly into the retrieval process. The core innovation lies in a Parallel Depth-Aware Retrieval engine, where sparse (BM25) and dense (vector) retrieval pathways independently apply a sophisticated, logarithmic depth-aware scoring function to re-rank candidates. This function intelligently balances semantic relevance with hierarchical preference. The optimized results from both paths are merged, and a final, standardized LLM-based arbitration mechanism with robust fault tolerance resolves topranked conflicts. A confidence-based fallback guarantees system resilience. Rigorous evaluation on the newly constructed AeroRef150 benchmark - 150 queries across five question types demonstrates that DeepPerception-RAG achieves 91.3% Gold Path Coverage (GPC) and reduces hallucination rates by over $\\mathbf{8 0 \\%}$ compared to baselines. This work contributes a state-of-the-art, resilient RAG framework, a hierarchical benchmark methodology, and a novel dataset for high-fidelity retrieval in complex industrial documentation."

Multiple industrial cameras are integrated within a cooperative hardware architecture, while the FPGA’s parallel processing capability supports real-time, multi-channel image acquisition and analysis. The core contribution lies in the hardware-level integration of the Kalman filter into synchronization control and defect tracking modules, enabling continuous estimation and prediction of fabric motion states. This predictive capability allows adaptive trigger timing and precise defect position compensation, effectively suppressing measurement noise and motion-induced misalignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system improves detection accuracy from 93% (without Kalman filtering) to 97%, reduces synchronization error to the sub-millimeter level, and decreases defect localization error from 10 mm to approximately 2 mm. These results confirm that embedded Kalman filtering substantially enhances the robustness and spatial – temporal precision of fabric inspection, providing a practical and high-performance solution for intelligent quality control in textile production lines."

Powered by machine learning algorithms and extensive datasets from wearables, smartphones, and smart environments, HAR systems now achieve high accuracy in recognizing and predicting activities. Beyond technical progress, however, the integration of HAR into everyday life raises critical sociocultural, ethical, and privacy concerns. While HAR supports healthcare interventions, elderly care, safety monitoring, and quality-of-life improvements, it also introduces risks of data misuse, algorithmic discrimination, and pervasive surveillance. These challenges highlight the need for transparent, fair, and accountable implementation strategies. Our review highlights three main findings: 1) HAR technologies demonstrate strong potential in domains such as healthcare, safety, and smart environments; 2) ethical risks—particularly privacy, surveillance, and fairness—remain pressing concerns; and 3) responsible deployment requires updated regulatory frameworks and collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and practitioners. This article presents a holistic perspective that bridges technical innovations with societal, ethical, and policy dimensions. Unlike prior HAR surveys focused mainly on algorithms or applications, our work emphasizes the dual role of HAR, as both a technological innovation and a societal challenge, offering a multidimensional guide for future development."

From in-cabin video, we extract Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and PERCLOS, Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) and yawning events, and 3D head orientation. A temporal encoder models sequential patterns, while channel attention emphasizes informative modalities and temporal attention highlights fatigue-critical moments. The system also produces concise language explanations by coupling attention weights with event statistics. Experiments on the NTHU Drowsy Driver Dataset show that our method outperforms unimodal eye-/mouth-/head-only baselines and a naïve multimodal variant without attention, achieving 92.8% accuracy, 0.91 F1-score, and 0.94 AUC. Visualization indicates robustness under occlusion (e.g., sunglasses) by shifting focus from eye cues to mouth and head dynamics. These results suggest that attention-assisted multimodal fusion provides accurate and interpretable fatigue recognition suitable for driver monitoring systems."

However, traditional methods relying on manual observation or fully supervised learning are limited by high annotation costs and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for UAV-based succulent classification. The method first involves fine-tuning a teacher model on a small, labeled dataset, which then generates pseudo-labels for a large volume of unlabeled UAV imagery. These pseudo-labels are iteratively refined to train a student model, effectively reducing dependence on manual annotation while enhancing model generalization. Experimental results show that as unlabeled data was incorporated, the mean Average Precision (mAP@50) increased from 83.1% to 85.5% with negligible impact on inference speed. Among evaluated architectures, YOLOv12x achieved the best overall performance. The proposed framework offers cost-effective solution for large-scale succulent classification in real-world environments."

To overcome PSO's tendency to fall into local optima and its insufficient capability for multi-objective collaborative optimization, a dual-phase hybrid optimization framework is designed: the first phase employs PSO to generate a set of feasible initial solutions that satisfy capacity constraints; the second phase introduces the 2-opt operator to perform topological reconstruction of path segments and conduct in-depth optimization. This dual optimization mechanism effectively coordinates the two major objectives of minimizing total path cost and balancing vehicle loads. Simulation experiments based on standard benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in both solution quality and convergence efficiency, providing an efficient and robust new method for optimizing CVRP."

    "abstract": "Most modern networks for high-performance computing systems (HPC) for aerospace systems are hierarchical structures of relatively autonomous subnets. Many data flows (streams) are transmitted via multiple subnets in such systems. The characteristics of data flows vary significantly over time, so subnets should be considered as aggregates of resources that can be redistributed over time by different data flows. This article proposes a methodology for resource redistribution (load balancing) based on situational management and multi-agent self-learning systems with a reinforcement learning scheme. Network resources are organized into groups – potentially possible data transmission paths for data flows. The same resources can be included in paths belonging to different flows and used depending on the current situation in network. Resource allocation (path selection) is carried out by self-learning agents located in the edge routers of the subnet. A distributed system of agents acts to achieve a common welfare (common good) – to reduce the number of data packet losses. One of the main problems in such systems is communication: delays in the distribution of information about the state of the system and information between agents necessary for decisionmaking. The article proposes a methodology that ensures the distribution of network resources in conditions of time-varying delays in the propagation of information necessary for making management decisions; changes in the subnet associated with changes in the number of resources, the number of data transmission paths, and data flows. Estimates of achievable characteristics obtained using this methodology are given."

However, empirical studies have shown that users often rely on personally identifiable information (PII) or perform simple modifications of historical passwords, which significantly increases password predictability and exposes severe security risks. Traditional password generation models, such as Markov models and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFG), have demonstrated effectiveness in general password guessing but fail to leverage contextual information in targeted guessing scenarios. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, new opportunities have emerged for password modeling and generation. In this paper, we propose a personalized targeted password generation scheme based on deep neural networks. Our approach incorporates a Transformer-based architecture enhanced with a pointer-copy mechanism and an edit prediction module, explicitly modeling password reuse and modification behaviors. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms traditional and deep learning baselines, including Markov, PCFG, TarGuess, and PassGAN, achieving higher Hit@k rates and better cross-domain generalization. This study not only provides a novel technical path for targeted password guessing but also offers valuable insights for password strength evaluation and the design of defensive strategies."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of low power density and limited efficiency of the traditional two-stage single-phase Boost inverter, a high-frequency and low-frequency dual-mode control strategy is proposed. By dynamically adjusting the bus voltage waveform (partial sinusoidal form/constant DC form), the alternating high-frequency operation of the front-stage Boost converter and the rear-stage inverter is realized. When the Boost converter operates in high-frequency to match the peak/trough of the output sinusoidal voltage, a pair of power switches in the inverter is directly turned on at low frequency, which reduces switching losses. When the inverter performs high-frequency modulation on the middle section of the output sinusoidal voltage, the power switch of the Boost converter is turned off, which reduces conduction losses, and the system efficiency is improved. and improves the system efficiency. Furthermore, based on the bus voltage waveform under dual-mode control, the minimum power loss of the single-phase Boost inverter is calculated, so as to obtain the dual-mode switching point with optimal efficiency and further enhance the efficiency. This work pioneers a time-domain power processing paradigm that intelligently allocates high-frequency switching operations. Validated by a 500W prototype, it achieves a record-high efficiency of 97.1% for its class while virtually eliminating the bulky electrolytic capacitor (96.3% volume reduction)."

    "abstract": "Performance models help us to understand how HPC applications scale, which is crucial for efficiently utilizing HPC resources. They describe the performance (e.g., runtime) as a function of one or more execution parameters (e.g., problem size and the degree of parallelism). Creating one manually for a given program is challenging and time-consuming. Automatically learning a model from performance data is a viable alternative, but potentially resource-intensive. Extra-P is a tool that implements this approach. The user begins by selecting values for each parameter. Each combination of values defines a possible measurement point. The choice of measurement points affects the quality and cost of the resulting models, creating a complex optimization problem. A naive approach takes measurements for all possible measurement points, the number of which grows exponentially with the number of parameters. In our earlier work, we demonstrated that a quasi-linear number of points is sufficient and that prioritizing the least expensive points is a generic strategy with a good trade-off between cost and quality. Here, we present an improved selection strategy based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that selects points individually for each modeling task. In our synthetic evaluation, which was based on tens of thousands of artificially generated functions, the naive approach achieved 66% accuracy with two model parameters and 5% artificial noise. At only 10% of the naïve approach's cost, the generic approach already achieved 47.3% accuracy, while the GPR-based approach achieved even 77.8% accuracy. Similar improvements were observed in experiments involving different numbers of model parameters and noise levels, as well as in case studies with realistic applications."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled massive multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) two-way relay (TWR) system, where multiple pairs of ground users (GUs) aim to exchange their information via an amplify-and-forward (AF) UAV relay. We consider that deploy a hovering rotary-wing UAV equipped with multiple antennas and operating in full-duplex (FD) mode, to provide reliable links to the GUs with emergency communications needs during periods of temporary damage to ground base stations. Minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation is employed by the UAV to obtain the air-ground channel state information (CSI), while maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) is adopted to process the signals of GUs. Analytical general closed-form expressions are derived for the sum spectrum efficiency (SE) and total energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed system in the case of imperfect CSI, as well as their respective asymptotic expressions. Based on the obtained expressions, the power scaling laws are presented. The numerical results suggest that the proposed system can achieve higher SE performance than terrestrial massive MIMO relay system due to strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, and the advantage is more obvious with more number of antennas. Furthermore, the optimal hovering height of the UAV is explored, which increases as the number of antennas increases. Also, to achieve a trade-off between SE and EE, it is desirable to increase the transmit power of the GUs when increasing the number of antennas at the UAV. Finally, we confirm the proposed scheme can better enhance the SE of multiple GU pairs communication system by comparing NOMA with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), FD and half duplex (HD) schemes."

    "abstract": "Explicit model predictive direct speed control (EMP-DSC) for permanent magnet synchronous motors can achieve excellent control performance with high dynamics and high precision. However, the universality of existing circular-constraint linearization and the flux-weakening region’s current distribution strategy is limited, making it difficult to fully exploit the extreme operating capability of motors with different parameters. Therefore, this paper fully combines the EMP constraint linearization principle and the motor’s flux-weakening mechanism, and proposes an EMP-DSC method based on “chord constraint” that is highly adapted to flux-weakening operation. The proposed method first obtains the extreme slopes of lines connecting the intersection points of the voltage and current limit circles with the center of the voltage limit circle across the entire speed range in the dq-axis current plane. Then, a single, fixed arc on the voltage limit circle that participates in the entire flux-weakening process is determined and its corresponding chord is used as a boundary to construct the optimal voltage constraint polytope and used as the flux-weakening trajectory to determine the current distribution. The proposed universal method enables full utilization of the extreme operating capabilities of motors with different parameters under the EMP-DSC framework, and its feasibility is validated by experimental results."

    "abstract": "As intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising technology capable of configuring the wireless environment favorably, channel estimation for IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Despite the development of numerous algorithms to address this challenge, a comprehensive theoretical characterization of the optimal recovery error is still lacking. This paper aims to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees in terms of stable recovery of channel matrices for noisy measurements. We begin by establishing the equivalence between IRS-assisted MIMO systems in the uplink scenario and a compact tensor train (TT)-based tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression. Building on this equivalence, we then investigate the restricted isometry property (RIP) for complex-valued subgaussian measurements. Our analysis reveals that successful recovery hinges on the relationship between the number of user terminals and the number of time slots during which channel matrices remain invariant. Utilizing the RIP condition, we establish a theoretical upper bound on the recovery error for solutions to the constrained least-squares optimization problem, as well as a minimax lower bound for the considered model. Our analysis demonstrates that the recovery error decreases inversely with the number of time slots, and increases proportionally with the total number of unknown entries in the channel matrices, thereby quantifying the fundamental trade-offs in channel estimation accuracy. In addition, we explore a multi-hop IRS scheme and analyze the corresponding recovery errors. Finally, we have performed numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings."

In this paper, we investigated if the cells in the motor thalamus (Mthal) can also be modulated (i.e. spikes entrained) via the CN-Mthal projections in rodents. A total of 82 thalamic cells were found, presumably in the Mthal by their stereotaxic coordinates, that were modulated by tACS of the cerebellum. Out of the 346 cells isolated, the thalamic cells with shorter action potentials and regular firing patterns had a higher probability of modulation by cerebellar stimulation than the cells with wider action potentials. The modulation level had a tuning curve with a maximum around 100-200 Hz. Spike histograms over the stimulation cycle transitioned between unimodal and bimodal distributions depending on the frequency. Most cells had a unimodal distribution at low frequencies, a bimodal distribution for frequencies between 80-125 Hz, and then a unimodal one for frequencies above 150 Hz. In addition, tACS of the motor cortex (MC) was also tested in a subset of thalamic cells. Unlike cerebellar stimulation, modulation levels peaked at two distinct frequencies, presumably due to entrainment through multiple MC-Mthal pathways with different preferred frequencies. The results demonstrate the feasibility of modulating a deep brain structure such as the thalamus through multi-synaptic pathways by stimulation of the cerebellar cortex (and the motor cortex) using a non-invasive neuromodulation method."

    "abstract": "Use of bright and fast scintillator can improve the performance of radiation detectors in a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, nuclear security, and industrial inspection. However, a significant number of photons are lost at the interface between the scintillator and the photosensor due to the refractive index mismatch, which can degrade the performance of the system. Conventional coupling methods such as optical grease or air gaps are limited by long-term stability or severe reflection losses due to large refractive index mismatch. In this study, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of applying an ultra-thin coating layer on scintillator surfaces as a simple and effective alternative for improved light collection. In this study, we used finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to evaluate how the thickness and refractive index of an optical coating layer influence photon transmittance in GAGG, BGO, and LYSO scintillators. Coating thicknesses ranging from 50 nm to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex> and refractive indices from 1.4 to 1.9 were tested. The resulting photon transmittance and light extraction gain from scintillator to photosensor was compared against conventional coupling configurations using a 100 nm air gap and a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$26 \\mu ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex> layer of optical grease. As a results, thin layer coated scintillator showed better photon transmittance over all photon incident angle compared to that of optical grease. Compared to air gap configurations, optimized layers thickness <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(50 \\sim 100 ~\\text{nm})$</tex> and with refractive index <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(1.7 \\sim 1.8)$</tex> showed light extraction gains of up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\times 1.48, \\times 1.54$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\times 1.44$</tex> for GAGG, BGO, and LYSO, respectively.

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the development and utilization of a high-resolution, real-time alpha-particle imaging detector for visualizing alpha particles emitted from At-211 within cells. The key development involves using a GAGG:Ce scintillator single-crystal plate, which allows the acquisition of clear optical images of cells and alpha particles' distribution. Initially, mesenchymal stem cells, with or without transduction of the Na-Iodide symporter (NIS), were cultured and subsequently treated with NaAt to facilitate At-211 uptake. Following a 30-minute incubation period, the cells were fixed, and optical images were acquired through a GAGG:Ce scintillator. Thereafter, under conditions of complete darkness to eliminate ambient light interference, alpha particles emitted from within the cells were imaged within the identical field of view. Alphaparticle imaging was conducted through 600 one-second exposures, processed by stacking and projecting along the Z-axis. Composite images integrating optical and alpha-particle data were generated to visualize the distribution of alpha particles within cells. The study further explored the integrated density (product of the particle image area and the mean gray value), representing the light intensity emitted by the scintillator corresponding to alpha particles' energy. Histograms of integrated density revealed two peaks, suggestive of alpha particles from At-211 with energies of 5.87 MeV and 7.45 MeV. This energy information was successfully obtained from image data, providing critical insights into alpha-particle behavior. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the developed imaging detector in real-time visualization of alpha particles on an event-by-event basis. Future research aims to establish a methodology for quantifying radioactivity from the acquired images, contributing substantially to the development of At-211-based therapeutic agents."

The key distinctive feature, i.e., the utilization of cost-effective plastic scintillators [3], [4], could facilitate a wider adoption of large FOV scanners [5]. Simultaneously, dedicated brain PET imaging has shown various exciting applications, hence in this work we study the combination of the TB-J-PET with a brain PET insert via Monte Carlo simulations. For the latter we employ the software package GATE v9.3, enabling multi-detector geometries (including in-house corrections of the Compton interactions). The main motivations are higher sensitivity and higher spatial resolution, which is analyzed through MLEM reconstructions of the Derenzo pantom. The CASToR software platform has been used to reconstruct the activity with the present unconventional geometry. For the brain insert, we investigate two detector configurations with different scintillator dimensions: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6 \\times 30 \\text{mm}^{2}$</tex> vs. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4 \\times 18 ~\\text{mm}^{2}$</tex> (lateral size × depth).

    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) consists of many resource-constrained medical devices that provide patients with medical services anytime and anywhere. In such an environment, the collection and sharing of medical records raise serious security concerns. Although various cryptographic schemes have been proposed, most fail to address two critical threats simultaneously: (i) sensitive data exposure caused by external cloud servers and/or open network environments; (ii) algorithm substitution attacks (ASAs) by internal adversaries. Furthermore, when data owners (e.g., delegators) are inconvenient to process their data, it is desirable to establish a more fine-grained way to delegate encryption rights. To tackle these issues, we propose a subversion-resistant autonomous path proxy re-encryption with an equality test function (SRAP-PRET). Specifically, our scheme allows the delegator to create a multi-hop delegation path in advance with the delegator's preferences, effectively preventing unauthorized access. By deploying a cryptographic reverse firewall zone, SRAP-PRET addresses the problem of information leakage caused by adversaries initiating ASAs. Additionally, SRAP-PRET also supports secure deduplication and efficient data decryption. Security analysis shows that SRAP-PRET provides resistance against ASAs and security against chosen plaintext attacks. Performance evaluations demonstrate that SRAP-PRET offers enhanced security properties without sacrificing efficiency."

Among these, the stochastic nature of diffusion model's reverse process may introduce lesion morphology variations, potentially causing false positives or negatives in small lesion detection. To address this, our study systematically evaluated the reconstruction performance of different methods (GF, BM3D, U-Net, SR3) at gradient count levels (100 %, 50 %, 25 %, 10 %, 5 %), quantifying SR3's advantages in lesion contrast recovery and noise suppression.

    "abstract": "System sensitivity is an important performance parameter for any imaging modality, and particularly so for molecular imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET). To accommodate the diverse system designs of small animal PET tomographs, as well as consistent errors in the application of the then current NEMA NU-2 methodology, the small animal PET standards group elected to use a Na-22 point source rather than the specified F-18 line-source with attenuating sleeves. The NU-4 standard was released in 2008 and, since then, there has been an explosion in the variation of clinical PET tomographs. This work extends the NU-4 standard to support any tomograph geometry and makeup, by spatially windowing on the source, and demonstrates that the results are equivalent to those resulting from the NU-2 methodology by applying both methods to tomographs of 16,26 and 106 cm axial extent. The sensitivity reported by the proposed and NU-2 methods differed by less than 2.5% relative."

This is often achieved by utilizing arrays of pixellated crystals coupled to photodetectors. Typically, in over half of the coincidence events recorded by such detectors, one of the two 511 keV gamma rays deposits its energy in two scintillators. These occurrences are referred to as Inter-Crystal Scatter events (ICS). This introduces an ambiguity in the lines of response, due to the impossibility of determining which of the two crystals has been hit first, which can degrade the spatial resolution."

Conventional NEMA standards recommend a 70 cm scatter phantom, but this does not adequately represent human imaging conditions on LAFOV scanners. This study evaluates the suitability of the conventional NEMA scatter phantom and an extended 175 cm long phantom by comparing them to human data acquired on the uEXPLORER total-body PET scanner over the past six years of operation. Data from numerous clinical patients and research participants were analyzed, to calculate average scatter fraction, human count rates at various activities, and the predominant axial activity distribution in humans.

    "abstract": "Water vapor tomography (WVT) is often ill-posed due to sparse Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and uneven station distribution, which impedes the acquisition of accurate and unique solutions. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a robust hybrid-constrained adaptive algebraic reconstruction technique (RHCAART), which integrates robust estimation principles to reduce the impact of observational errors and enhances solution robustness. To evaluate its performance, validation experiments were conducted using Hong Kong continuously operating reference station (CORS) observations from June 2020. The results demonstrate that the proposed RHCAART method improves tomographic accuracy over the Adaptive Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (AART), reducing bias by 23.81%, mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.39%, and root mean square error (RMSE) by 23.04%. Moreover, the reconstructed water vapor density (WVD) fields show high correlation with radiosonde profiles and align more closely with ERA5 reanalysis data in spatial comparisons than conventional techniques. These results validate the reliability and superior performance of the RHCAART, highlighting its potential for high-accuracy WVD reconstruction in complex terrains under challenging conditions."

LGADs are a type of silicon avalanche photodiodes originally developed for the fast detection of minimum ionizing particles for high-energy particle detectors. We study its detection capability on different types of ionization particles, such as X-rays, gamma-rays, alphas, and examine its intrinsic quantum efficiency with non-ionization optical photons. The thin substrate with a moderate internal gain <100 is sufficient to compensate for the reduced charge deposition and overcome the noise of a read-out system. Here, using near infrared photon pulses, we demonstrated LGAD can accurately measure a nearly 1-MIP equivalent minimum ionizing particles with picosecond timing resolution. The capabilities of this new type of LGAD allow us to probe the underlying physics of the multiplication process and to provide fast timing for particle detection in a variety of applications."

    "abstract": "The real-time and accurate assessment of product performance is crucial to ensure production stability and product quality in steel production. In this study, an electromagnetic non-destructive testing (ENDT) system for the mechanical properties (yield strength, tensile strength, elongation) of cold-rolled strip is developed, which incorporates four types of electromagnetic detection techniques, including Magnetic Barkhausen Noise, Tangential Magnetic Field, Magnetic Incremental Permeability, and Multi-frequency Eddy Current. A network-based model is proposed which consists of a Self-Adaptive Convolutional Channel Attention Mechanism (SACAM) module and an Extended Channel Depthwise Separable Convolution (EDSC) module to predict the mechanical properties of strips based on the extracted magnetic features. SACAM-EDSC takes advantages of channel attention mechanism in feature enhancement and depth-separable convolution in model lightness. An actual steel coil dataset collected from the ENDT system was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, which consisted of 41 input dimensions and 1521 sample numbers. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree Regression (DT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Neural Network (NN) and three deep learning algorithms, namely ShuffleNet, GhostNet, EDSC were implemented to conduct comparative studies on the same dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared with the other approaches."

    "abstract": "The localization and mapping of radiation-contaminated hotspots have potential applications in nuclear decommissioning, environmental monitoring, and homeland security. However, localizing distributed sources is often challenging due to a blurring effect caused by the radiation spread. This exaggerates the edges of the radiation source. A scanning system and techniques are proposed in this study that will allow more accurate source localization and mapping. The scanning system features a commercial robotic arm, the Eva automata, fitted with a compact Bismuth Germanate (BGO) detector to scan across the area of interest in a raster pattern. To test the detection and mapping capabilities of the system, a radiation-contaminated environment was simulated using potassium-40, a naturally occurring radioisotope, as the radiation source. Potassium-40 emits 1460 keV gamma rays about 11% of the time during its decay. Directional detection of these gamma rays will give insight into the radiation intensity across the test area. From this, 2D radiation maps were generated by overlaying the positional data from the robot with the radiation data from the gamma radiation sensor. Furthermore, some image processing techniques, such as the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm and bi-cubic interpolation, were applied to the radiation maps to create sharp and smoother-looking maps with an accuracy of about 5 cm. The technical details of the proposed scanning system are presented."

    "abstract": "With the continuous expansion of automation and unmanned demand in industry, hydraulic cylinders, as one of the most important industrial actuators, urgently need the fault diagnosis solutions that can balance the key performance of execution efficiency, detection accuracy, and adaptability to working conditions. However, the existing hydraulic cylinder fault diagnosis methods have limitations in two main aspects: (1) tend to use signal processing methods, and have deficiencies in hybrid fault detection capability; (2) unable to adapt to changing working conditions, and thus have poor engineering adaptability. This work focuses on the hybrid leakage (including both internal and external leakage) fault diagnosis of hydraulic cylinder, and proposes a lightweight neural network with load condition regression. Firstly, simulation calculations under changing working conditions are used to analyze the pressure fluctuation characteristics of hydraulic cylinders under hybrid leakage. The results show that the leakage amounts caused by the same leakage conditions under different load conditions are different, the pressure fluctuation characteristics in the time-frequency domain also change accordingly, and the impact of internal leakage and external leakage on pressure characteristics is different. Then, the pressure fluctuation characteristics in the time-frequency domain are used to construct fault features for hybrid leakage of hydraulic cylinders. Specifically, the wavelet packet decomposition is used to extract the multidimensional time-frequency domain features, a neural network-based load regression is trained, and then an attention mechanism is involved to optimize the multidimensional time-frequency domain features by the load regression results. Next, a multi task neural network classifier identifying the leakage type and degree is trained. Finally, the experimental results verify the accuracy and robustness of this novel lightweight network in processing test bench data compared with several recently popular classification methods."

    "abstract": "Iodinated contrast agents enhance anatomical detail and improve diagnostic accuracy in CT imaging. With advancements in spectral CT, the ability to accurately quantify iodine has further elevated its role as a potential imaging biomarker. However, CT system validations still rely on simplistic, non-anthropomorphic phantoms, and there are currently no anatomically realistic, iodine-enhanced phantoms available. To address this gap, we expand upon our previously developed PixelPrint 3D-printing method by introducing a novel iodine-infused Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament (IodinePrint). This filament enables the fabrication of anatomically accurate phantoms with clinically relevant iodine enhancement. Iodine-rich compounds were embedded into PLA pellets using a dual-solvent technique. Following solvent evaporation, modified pellets were extruded into 1.75 mm filament. As an initial test, we printed four calibration cubes with varying infill ratios (30-90%) and compared them to commercially available iodine inserts. A cylindrical calibration phantom was fabricated using a dual-extruder 3D printer, featuring pie-slice segments with iodine concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 10.4mg/mL. Based on this calibration, a section of a pancreatic CT scan was printed using IodinePrint filament to generate a lifelike, iodine-enhanced phantom. Spectral CT imaging demonstrated a similar spectral match between the printed cubes and commercial inserts and a linear correlation between Hounsfield units and iodine concentration in the calibration phantom. The pancreatic phantom exhibited contrast levels within physiologically expected ranges and presented realistic textures and anatomical detail in conventional and iodine images. The introduced 3D-printing technology will aid in standardizing contrast-enhanced imaging protocols and optimizing spectral CT parameters for improved diagnostic accuracy."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based image synthesis has been widely explored for PET reconstruction, offering the ability to convert low-quality inputs into high-quality images with high computational efficiency. However, clinical adoption remains limited due to the lack of fast and reliable methods to quantify prediction uncertainty - an essential metric for safety and interpretability. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware extension of FastPET, a DL model that synthesizes MLEM-like PET images from multi-angle time-of-flight histo-images. Our approach introduces a novel inference framework based on Variance Propagation (VP) for joint estimation of (i) image reconstruction, (ii) aleatoric uncertainty (data variance) and (iii) epistemic uncertainty (model confidence). Unlike conventional uncertainty estimation methods that typically require multiple stages or stochastic passes and are computationally expensive, VP analytically propagates mean and variance through the network in a single forward pass, enabling efficient estimation with minimal overhead. We evaluated the proposed method on a clinical pilot study of 5 whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Compared to the standard Monte Carlo dropout-based FastPET, our VPbased model achieved equivalent reconstruction accuracy and uncertainty estimates, with <0.02% SUVmax error and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;5.3 \\%$</tex> deviation in both uncertainties. Inference time was reduced by up to 95 %, showing a significant gain in computational efficiency. These results suggest that VP enables fast, uncertainty-aware PET reconstruction. It potentially provides a practical pathway toward clinically reliable deployment of DL, and facilitates more informed decision-making in clinical workflows."

The EL2 level strongly traps holes, thus increasing resistivity. The Cr-related level captures excess electrons, which further enhances resistivity and, by neutralizing charge accumulation induced by high-flux radiation, effectively mitigates polarization effects."

    "abstract": "In this article, a new methodology is proposed for MOSFET parameter extraction and modeling of transfer behavior from weak to strong inversion range in ohmic operation at cryogenic temperatures. The propounded methodology is based on an empirical mobility law which considers that the Coulomb scattering mechanism prevails in weak inversion, while it is the surface roughness mechanism in strong inversion at temperatures lower than 30K. It permits to extraction of the inversion charge from weak to strong inversion range through <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I$</tex-math> </inline-formula>–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$V$</tex-math> </inline-formula> measurements. It appears that the estimated inversion charge behavior may concur with the one analytically constructed using the Lambert-W function approach. The new methodology can be employed when the conventional mobility law, through a negative first-order intrinsic mobility attenuation factor, fails to model the Coulomb scattering mechanism in weak inversion at very cryogenic temperatures."

To address this limitation, we devised a high-throughput radiochemistry system for rapid development of radiotracers for imaging and radiotherapeutics for cancer therapy. The core of the system is a silicon wafer that contains a 4×4 array of 3mm diameter microdroplet reaction sites allowing simultaneous droplet-based radiosynthesis. A critical requirement for these systems is that the activity of the droplets must be repeatedly measured to monitor the efficacy of each radiosynthesis step. Previously, we presented at this conference a method to rapidly measure radioactivity for positron imaging isotopes. Quantification of radioactivity in droplets is complicated by variations in overall positron energy deposition depending on the stage of synthesis, including the volume of the droplet. We showed that we could determine the activity in the droplets but required measuring both the intrinsic but weak Cerenkov light produced by positrons inside droplets and measuring the stronger scintillation light generated above the reaction sites from positrons that exit the droplets and interact in a scintillator. In this work, we demonstrate a simpler method to determine the droplet activity using only Cerenkov light by introducing a custom made “converter” layer covering the droplets that allows collection of Cerenkov light from the positrons that is less dependent of the droplet volume and geometry. Here we seek to determine the sensitivity and efficacy of this method to measure the activity in the droplets via Monte Carlo simulations of positrons emanating from arrays of droplets. We also present preliminary data from a 3D printed plastic converter place over radioactive droplets."

    "abstract": "Since positron lifetime varies with the surrounding electron density, it may be applicable, for example, to oxygen partial pressure sensing for hypoxia imaging. Therefore, we are aiming to realize quantum PET (Q-PET), in which diagnosis is based on positron lifetime rather than positron distribution. However, in living organisms, there are few basic data that correlate positron lifetime values with diagnostic information. In order to establish such a database, in this work, we proposed a positron lifetime imaging method that enables 3D analysis of tissue samples. The key technology is a MeV-order gamma ray beam available at the Ultraviolet Synchrotron Orbital Radiation Facility (UVSOR) in the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS). Specifically, inside a sample irradiated with the beam, positrons are produced by pair production. With a pair of PET detectors mounted in the beam line, the positron lifetime is imaged in three dimensions, by considering the beam generation time as the start signal and the detection time of annihilation photon pairs as the stop signal. As the first experiment, we used one pair of detectors consisting of a 3.2 mm square <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8 \\times 8 \\text{LGSO}$</tex> scintillator array coupled to a 3.2 mm pitch <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8 \\times 8 \\text{MPPC}$</tex> array module. This detector pair was placed opposite each other at a distance of 10 cm, inclined at 15 degrees to the direction of the beam. A stainless steel plate (known lifetime value: 106 ps) and a polycarbonate plate (known lifetime value: 2.1 ns) were placed separately to check the difference in positron lifetime spectra during beam irradiation. We also placed two samples within the field of view of the detector pair and performed simple 2D PET imaging. Details of the experimental results will be reported in the conference presentation."

Those applications generally require SPADs with high fill factors and strong sensitivities in the blue-green wavelength range, matching the emission spectrum of commonly used scintillators. While front-illuminated (FI) SPADs are advantageous for detecting blue-green wavelengths due to their shallow junction depth, they suffer from optical losses caused by stacked dielectric layers and low fill factors due to the peripheral region for the guard ring and anode/cathode. These can be addressed using back-illuminated (BI) SPADs, but those devices typically have deeper junctions and smaller pixel pitches, limiting blue-green sensitivity and suitability for biomedical applications. This study presents the optimized BI SPAD with aggressive backside thinning, active-area enlargement, and backside patterning. These structural optimizations reduce the epitaxial thickness, increase photon interaction volume, and enhance internal light scattering, leading to significantly improved photon detection probability (PDP) in the blue-green wavelength range. Experimental results exhibit a PDP increase rate of over 98.21 % at 3 V excess bias voltage with a low dark count rate of less than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$10 \\text{cps} / \\mu_{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "A prototype dual-headed Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) system has been developed at Kromek and UCL. Each head consists of an array of CZT detectors with sub-pixel resolution and depth-ofinteraction (DOI) capability equipped with multi-pinhole collimators, which allow multiplexing (MX). The system is stationary and provides limited-angle tomographic information. We have evaluated the performance of the prototype with phantom measurements in terms of lesion detection and dose reduction factor (DRF). We scanned a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{99 ~\\mathrm{m}}$</tex> Tc-filled phantom containing 5-9 mm diameter spherical inserts and a uniform background phantom separately. We generated data sets with different count statistics for target-to-background ratios (TBRs) of 10 and 20 using bootstrapping. Images were reconstructed with OSEM, including DOI-based de-MX. We estimated the lesion detection capability using contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and the scan statistic (SS) method. The analyses were done w and w/o noise reduction using the non-local means (NLM) filter. The filter had a significant effect on the CNR values but not on the SS results. The CNR results suggest that, with a DRF of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8,7-\\text{mm}$</tex> lesions were detectable with TBR=10 w or w/o NLM filter while, for TBR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=20,6-\\text{mm}$</tex> lesions were detectable w/o and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5-\\text{mm}$</tex> lesions w NLM filter. The SS evaluation resulted in AUC values of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.86,0.75$</tex> and 0.55 for DRFs of 1,2 and 4 with TBR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=10$</tex>, while with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{TBR}=20$</tex>, all AUC values were in the range 0.97 to 0.73. Although the SS results may seem less encouraging than the CNR ones, many of the false positive lesions were close to the edges, so we would expect better performance with the full-size system or with a smaller phantom. In conclusion, our results show that a reduction in dose or scan time of up to a factor of 8 may be possible with our novel MBI system."

It integrates four channels and each channel consists of a single-end to differential amplifier, a successiveapproximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC), a digital trapezoidal filter, a multichannel analyzer for photon-counting and an energy integration module. The digital trapezoidal filter can convert a bi-exponential signal into a trapezoidal signal with much shortened pulse width. Pile-up signals can be further identified and decomposed except for those arrives at the rise time of the trapezoidal. The energy spectra and output count rates (OCRs) at different input count rates (ICRs) are simulated. The maximum OCR of 11 Mcps was reached at 30 Mcps ICR for LYSO crystals. The energy integration information was simply estimated by simply summation of the signal waveforms. Hence the dynamic range can be extended even if the OCR saturates. The chip was designed in TSMC 65 nm process and the power consumption is less 5 mW per channel. It has been submitted in April and will be received in August.

With this goal, we have proposed implementing a large axial coverage PET system including time-of-flight (TOF) capabilities.

    "abstract": "Frequency security assessment (FSA) is critical for the safe operation of modern power systems, particularly under increasing uncertainty and renewable integration. In online prefault scenarios, a large set of anticipated disturbances, such as generator tripping, load shedding, and HVdc blocking, must be evaluated rapidly and accurately. However, existing data-driven methods struggle to capture disturbance mechanisms and neglect the spatial influence of disturbance locations, resulting in reduced generalization and reliability. To address these limitations, this article proposes a trustworthy disturbance-informed learning (DIL) framework that incorporates location-sensitive disturbance features into data-driven FSA. By integrating steady-state power flow with power disturbance data into graph-structured representations, DIL leverages graph convolutional networks (GCN) to extract topology-aware features. To reflect disturbance location differences, DIL modifies the dropout process in GCN training by replacing random sampling with location-based sampling. This helps the model focus on critical nodes, improving accuracy and robustness. In addition, disturbance location information enhances trustworthiness by comparing model attention with actual disturbance positions. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system and a provincial power grid in China (3748 buses) demonstrate that DIL outperforms existing models in accuracy and robustness, while enabling more trustworthy predictions."

A 0.7 cm thickness was identified as optimal for preserving full spectral information while minimizing gamma interference. To align simulated spectra with measured spectra, Gaussian Energy Broadening (GEB) was applied, and its parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The optimized parameters significantly improved the match between simulation and experiment, achieving a total mean squared error of 9.59E-07. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using simulation driven methods for accurate beta spectroscopy and detector calibration. The proposed method provides a foundation for applying beta spectral analysis to real-time leakage detection in nuclear environments."

In recent years, the integration of drone (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV) systems into construction projects has created new opportunities for efficiency, safety, and precision. This study examines the applications of drone technologies in construction management, focusing on site monitoring, progress tracking, structural defect detection, and completion time estimation. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of drones compared to conventional monitoring methods. Field studies and case analyses reveal that drones can reduce project monitoring time by up to 30%, minimize human errors, and enhance occupational safety by reducing the need for workers to access high risk areas. Additionally, drones equipped with photogrammetry and LiDAR sensors provide accurate 3D models for structural assessment and Building Information Modeling (BIM) integration. However, challenges remain in terms of data security, regulatory compliance, and operator training. This paper concludes that drone technologies, when systematically integrated into construction practices, offer significant advantages in time, cost, and safety, and proposes strategies for broader implementation in the industry."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades, and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to build more robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream tasks. Thus, we propose a novel \"Lung Nodule-SSM\" method, which utilizes self-supervised learning with DINOv2 as the backbone to enhance lung nodule detection and classification without the need for annotated data. Our methodology consists of two stages: first, the DINOv2 model is pretrained on unlabeled CT scans to learn robust feature representations; second, these features are fine-tuned using transformer-based architectures for lesion-level detection and accurate lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving an accuracy of 98.37%, which explains its effectiveness in lung nodule detection.

It is often difficult for a single feature to fully reflect the emotional information in speech, and multiple different features are complementary to each other, therefore, combining multiple features is often the key to improve the accuracy of speech emotion recognition. Based on this problem, this paper proposes a speech emotion recognition model SXANet based on multifeature fusion, which fuses three different features as inputs, and learns discourse-level features and frame-level features of the speech information through parallel spatial channel attentional convolution module and extended long and short-term memory network module, respectively. In addition, important channel and spatial features are also focused in the spatial channel attention convolution module due to the presence of spatial and channel attention mechanisms, thus providing richer features. In addition, the output of the parallel module is balanced by the weighted attention fusion mechanism, which improves the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the model. Extensive experiments are conducted on RAVDESS and EMODB datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has an accuracy of $91.97 \\%$ and $98.15 \\%$ on the two datasets, respectively, which proves the effectiveness and superiority of SXANet."

However, the dual-layer superposition effect of GFB-OFDM inevitably results in a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In order to solve the above issue, a novel DFT-based two-stage precoding algorithm is proposed, integrating the inherent processing mechanism of GFB-OFDM. Unlike conventional DFT precoding, the proposed algorithm first introduces subband-level DFT precoding before the first-stage IFFT, followed by intersubband DFT precoding prior to the second-stage IFFT. This two-level spreading of input symbols effectively mitigates PAPR. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that, compared with conventional GFB-OFDM and OFDM systems, the proposed scheme not only achieves significant PAPR reduction but also maintains implementation simplicity with low complexity."

    "abstract": "Cloud environments have recently become increasingly exposed to the growing complexity and volume of network traffic, thereby elevating the demand for robust, scalable, and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS). This study introduces an effective deep learning-based IDS that integrates advanced feature selection with a lightweight, high-performing deep learning model, FastViT, to address critical limitations observed in prior work, particularly in handling multiclass classification and severe class imbalance. Many previous studies evaluate model performance on a limited subset of attack types or treat each attack in isolation, often neglecting dataset balancing techniques. This leads to poor generalisation and reduced effectiveness in detecting complex and infrequent attacks under realistic conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes a FastViT-based approach, a hybrid convolutional-transformer architecture, trained and evaluated on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, which includes all attack categories. A hybrid feature selection strategy combining Boruta and SHAP is employed to enhance interpretability and improve learning efficiency by identifying the most relevant features. Dataset balancing is achieved through a combination of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and undersampling, ensuring fair representation of minority classes. Comparative experiments on both balanced and imbalanced datasets demonstrate significant improvements, particularly in recall, for underrepresented and challenging attack types such as Web and Infiltration."

    "abstract": "In this era, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have a very important role in various types of applications such as media transcription and online learning. High transcription accuracy in various languages and accents is crucial to support the development of inclusive technology. However, there is still not much research comparing the performance of ASR models in different languages and accents, especially for Indonesian and English with American accents. This study aims to compare the transcription accuracy of two ASR models, Wav2Vec2 for CTC and Whisper Turboscribe, by measuring the Word Error Rate (WER) on Indonesian and American English audio datasets. This study employs a quantitative experimental approach, with datasets collected from open sources and manually annotated. The results show that for American-accented English, Turboscribe achieved a lower WER of 0.15% compared to Wav2Vec2 with 0.64%, while for Indonesian, Wav2Vec2 outperformed Turboscribe with a WER of 3.58% versus 8.98%. Error analysis further indicates that English errors mainly involve names, places, and plural \"-s\" endings, whereas Indonesian errors are dominated by misrecognition of place names and verbs. These findings highlight the need for culturally and linguistically tailored ASR models, especially for under-resourced languages like Indonesian, and underscore the importance of dataset diversity and linguistic adaptation in improving transcription performance across languages."

    "abstract": "A number of challenges have been encountered in interconnecting a third-party solar farm to an existing refinery power distribution system over a pole line. There were limitations of the solar farm inverter fault sourcing ability, as well as operational challenges in maintaining appropriate system power factor. There were additional constraints imposed by the cyber-security requirements of interconnecting protection communications systems between multiple parties. The power transmission authority imposed additional constraints. And there were constraints due to the existing refinery infrastructure, both regarding inter-operability with existing switchgear relays and limitations of existing switchgear. These challenges and the implemented solutions will be discussed, along with possible alternate solutions to some of these challenges. We anticipate some of these challenges will be encountered by others in the pursuit of alternative power supply sources."

To address these issues, this paper proposes a next-generation improved YOLO model, termed NeoPCB-YOLO, with contributions spanning algorithm design, dataset construction, and system application. First, we introduce the FDConv (Frequency Domain Convolution) module into the model architecture, which dynamically generates convolution kernels in the frequency domain and integrates channel, filter, spatial, and kernel attentions to achieve multi-scale adaptive feature modulation, thereby enhancing the representation capability for complex defect patterns. Second, we construct a high-quality PCB defect dataset covering multiple typical defect categories, including missing holes, mouse bites, open circuits, shorts, spurs, and spurious copper, providing a reliable foundation for model training and evaluation. Finally, we develop a visualized user interface based on PyQt5 to intuitively present detection results and support human-computer interaction, facilitating deployment in industrial scenarios and quality traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that NeoPCB-YOLO achieves an mAP50 of over $95.6 \\%$, significantly outperforming the baseline model and validating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications. This study provides an efficient and deployable solution for automated defect detection in smart manufacturing and the PCB industry."

Our proposed architecture integrates the strengths of InceptionResNetV2, utilized as a spatial feature extractor, with a BiLSTM for performing contextual analysis. After fine-tuning an InceptionResNetV2 model that had previously been trained on ImageNet, we used transfer learning, to effectively extract rich visual details from leaf images. Subsequently, these extracted features were processed sequentially by the BiLSTM, enabling the model to understand the contextual relationships among them and thereby enhancing its capacity to differentiate between various disease types. Extensive testing on the Plant Village dataset, utilizing 5-fold cross-validation and comprehensive ablation studies, validated the model's superior performance. Consequently, we report an impressive average accuracy of 99.07%. Analysis further confirmed that the integration of the BiLSTM component and the fine-tuning process were crucial factors contributing to this high level of accuracy."

As proof, BuzzFeed shares have risen by 200% since announcing that they would use AI to create content. Buzzfeed also laid off 12% of its company workforce. Public acceptance of AI generators, despite the questionable ethics of generative AI outputs, shows a lack of appreciation and interest in illustrators. Therefore, to increase people’s interest in illustrators, the Gachacom website was designed and built using the gamification method and the Octalysis framework. Based on the results of website testing conducted using HMSAM, the percentage was 93.75, indicating a high level of user acceptance of the Gachacom website because it helps attract public interest in supporting illustrators' work."

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models have achieved remarkable results in chest X-ray classification. However, concerns remain regarding their fairness across demographic subgroups and variations in image acquisition. Evaluations that overlook these attributes may favor models that perform well overall but exhibit biased behavior, potentially harming underrepresented subgroups. In this study, we conduct a systematic fairness evaluation of DL models trained to detect 14 clinical findings in chest radiographs. Using three public datasets and EfficientNet-Based architectures, we assess both model performance and equity across sex and age groups, as well as different radiographic views, using specialized fairness metrics. To support this analysis, we developed an evaluation framework for multi-label fairness auditing, enabling direct comparison across different models, classes, and attributes. Our results reveal notable biases even in top-performing classifiers, particularly related to patient age and positioning during image acquisition, with class-dependent bias patterns. This demonstrates that performance metrics alone do not fully characterize model behavior or the risks associated with deployment in real-world scenarios. These findings highlight the need to incorporate fairness considerations when developing and selecting models for clinical use."

To address this, we propose a full-reference quality assessment method based on salient viewport extraction. First, a Binocular Perception Model (BPM) is constructed to simulate the binocular fusion and rivalry mechanisms of the human visual system, generating a combined binocular perception map. This map is integrated with a recursive probability sampling strategy to generate pseudo-viewports sequence with viewing habits. Then, a lightweight mini-DenseNet predicts the saliency map of each viewport, and BPM masking information is fused to weight the error maps, emphasizing distortions in salient and binocular conflict regions. Finally, a regression model produces the overall video quality score. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher consistency with subjective scores and better generalization than existing methods."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to automating the detection and optimization of inference bottlenecks in distributed deep learning systems through the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While traditional performance optimization in distributed environments requires extensive manual analysis across multiple components, this paper propose a static analysis framework that leverages LLMs' code comprehension capabilities to identify performance-critical patterns without execution.This system processes distributed model architectures and implementation code to generate an abstract syntax tree representation, which is then analyzed by a fine-tuned LLM trained on a curated dataset of 5,000+ annotated performance bottlenecks from production distributed environments. Experimental evaluation across 78 diverse distributed neural network deployments demonstrates that the approach identifies 93.7% of inference bottlenecks that would otherwise require dynamic profiling, while suggesting optimizations that yield an average 2.8x inference speedup on resource-constrained devices. A comparative analysis reveals this static analysis method reduces optimization time by 76% compared to conventional profiling-based approaches in distributed settings. Additionally, the system generates natural language explanations of detected issues and recommends contextually appropriate optimization strategies for distributed inference pipelines, facilitating knowledge transfer to practitioners. This research addresses critical challenges in deep learning deployment across distributed environments and enables more efficient utilization of computational resources in production systems."

Gradual polarization of the sensor is warping the electric field profile after applying a bias. The X-ray beam further worsens such deformation. It leads to instabilities and degrades both imaging performance and spectroscopic resolution. We measured the influence of the electric field profile in the biased CdTe sensor under X-ray beam exposition using various intensities and its stabilization by belowbandgap side illumination. We use Laser-Induced Transient Current Technique to characterize the electric field profile of the sensor. Synchronized pulsed bias is used to monitor the time evolution of sensor polarization. That enabled time evolution measurements of the polarization in a wide range from 10 s to 2000 s. The setup's detector and excitation parts were placed in a closed shielded box with an X-ray beam source and a shutter. The gradual evolution of the current waveforms shape is used to evaluate the electric field warping in all irradiation regimes."

Digital Electronics courses usually depend on hands-on sessions, which makes it hard to recreate those learning experiences online. A common issue for students was their difficulty in assembling electronic circuits, a skill that is usually developed through physical lab work with instructional kits. To address this gap, we developed a mobile-based digital practicum simulator that aims to improve students’ motor skills and hands-on learning. The simulator is available on smartphones and allows for interactive circuit assembly that mimics real-world lab conditions. The prototype includes decoder and encoder content modules, creating a solid framework for ongoing development. Early feedback from users shows significant improvements in students’ technical skills and engagement. These results support the simulator’s ability to enhance remote engineering education, especially when access to traditional labs is limited. Furthermore, the system effectively incorporates encoder and decoder features, laying a strong foundation for further progress."

    "abstract": "In the face of the storage, transmission and processing pressure brought about by the surge in the number of air targets and the explosive growth of trajectory data, trajectory segmentation and compression technology has become the key to improving the efficiency of situational analysis. Aiming at the problem of inaccurate feature point selection in the existing line segment simplification methods, a segmented compression method of air target trajectories based on the improved ant colony algorithm is proposed. Based on the solution framework of the 0-1 backpack problem, the method innovatively introduces the dynamic update mechanism of trajectory point value and pheromone global optimization strategy: firstly, the trajectory point weight is initialized based on the value evaluation function, and the value of non-feature points is dynamically adjusted through the iteration process to strengthen the screening ability of key feature points. Secondly, the pheromone update mechanism is improved to avoid local optimization by equilibrium path selection probability. Experiments show that when the compression ratio is 21.57%, increasing the number of ants and the number of iterations can significantly improve the segmentation accuracy. Compared with the traditional algorithm, the segmentation accuracy of the proposed method is better than that of TRACLUS and TCSS algorithms under the same compression ratio, and is significantly improved compared with the DP algorithm in the low compression scenario. The research results provide an efficient solution for the real-time processing of massive trajectory data, which has both engineering practicability and algorithm superiority."

The models were trained and evaluated using a total of 1,185 annotated CCTV images to ensure robust performance across diverse visual scenarios. Each model introduces architectural innovations aimed at improving detection accuracy and inference efficiency. Experimental results show that YOLOv10 achieved the fastest inference time (23.3 ms) with a mAP@50 of 0.942, making it suitable for low-latency environments. YOLOv12 offered slightly higher accuracy with a mAP@50 of 0.943, but at the cost of a longer inference time (41.4 ms). YOLOv11 demonstrated the best overall trade-off, attaining the highest accuracy with a mAP@50 of 0.952 and a reasonable inference time of 30 ms. These findings suggest that YOLOv11 offers the most practical balance between detection quality and computational efficiency, making it a strong candidate for real-world helmet violation detection systems."

A gallium-arsenide operational amplifier that does not contain current mirrors, as well as resistors that establish the static mode of gallium-arsenide field-effect and gallium-arsenide bipolar transistors is studied in the article. A promising gallium arsenide technological process, mastered by the Minsk Research Institute of Radio Materials, ensures the creation of only p-n-p BJT and nJFet transistors. The absence of n-p-n transistors creates problems in the construction of high-temperature gallium-arsenide operational amplifiers, which are in demand in a number of important branches of science and technology - space instrumentation, oil and gas, automobile and aviation industries. It is shown that the proposed circuit solutions minimize the systematic component of the zero offset voltage and can be recommended for practical use in analog interfaces designed to operate at elevated temperatures."

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems based on deep neural networks remain susceptible to adversarial samples. Input reconstruction is a widely adopted defense due to its independence from the target model. However, most of these methods focus on removing the adversarial perturbation rather than preserving identity-related features, which limits their effectiveness in defense. To address this problem, we propose Identity-Embedded Features Defense (IEFD), a novel framework that transforms the adversarial facial images to clean samples by leveraging identity-embedded features extracted. During the feature extraction stage, the Highlight Identity-Relevant Regions Module (HIRM) works in collaboration with the encoder through an enhanced attention mechanism, enabling more targeted extraction of identity-relevant features. Besides, to further preserve identity information in the feature representation, the Adaptive Channel-Reduction Convolution (ACC) is introduced in the image reconstruction stage, which enriches more identity information into the extracted features by combining adaptive channel-reduction convolution operations with identity loss. Through the collaborative optimization of these two modules, the resulting identity-embedded feature serves as the foundation for facial image reconstruction to improve the recognition accuracy of target models. Experimental results on the LFW dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches under several adversarial attacks, effectively preserving identity semantics while mitigating adversarial noise."

Technologies such as cognitive radio provide a specific approach using “spectrum white spots” for secondary (unlicensed) users. The cognitive radio method allows secondary users to avoid interference, capture free channel timeslots, and transmit and receive data. Many algorithms have been proposed for best-effort service, including machine learning algorithms (a subset of artificial intelligence). As a result of our investigations, we propose the same system with a software-defined radio device prototype to analyze experimental data. This paper examines the results of the most effective machine learning with a reinforcement algorithm received from the software-defined radio board. In addition, we consider the peculiarities of implementing cognitive radio on an experimental board and analyze the probability of spectrum occupancy in different design models."

    "abstract": "This research was conducted to develop a counseling model that can answer racial issues high school students face when using social media through increasing cultural intelligence. The development was carried out through the ADDIE development design. Based on the results of the needs analysis, it was concluded that the model was developed using website media in the form of short videos. The model is implemented through four main stages, namely: (1) Phase I Filling in the description of the initial condition of students; (2) Phase II Scheduling counseling; (3) Phase III Implementation of counseling; and (4) Phase IV reflection and self-description of post-counseling counselees. The results of the model acceptance test on counseling material experts, media experts, and potential users found that the developed model has a good acceptance value. Statistically, it was found that there was an increase in the cultural intelligence of high school students after participating in counseling with the developed model. This happened because the model was developed by the underlying theories. A concise cybercounseling model with a solution focus based on Pancasila values can improve the cultural intelligence of high school students when they use social media."

    "abstract": "Small Local Area Networks (LANs), such as those in educational institutions, small businesses, and branch offices, often lack dedicated security teams and enterprise-grade monitoring tools, making them vulnerable to service exposure and configuration-based attacks. To address this gap, this study designs and implements a lightweight, Python-based port scanning tool tailored for security assessment in resource-constrained environments. The tool employs optimized SYN-style connect scanning to efficiently detect open TCP ports within the wellknown range $(\\mathbf{1}-\\mathbf{1 0 2 4})$, with a $\\mathbf{2}$-second timeout to balance accuracy and performance. Deployed in a campus network testbed, the scanner successfully identified five high-risk service exposures, including cleartext protocols (FTP on port 21, Telnet on port 23), unsecured web services (HTTP on port 80), and improperly exposed database services (MySQL on port 3306). Based on these findings, targeted security hardening measures-such as protocol migration to encrypted alternatives, service minimization, configuration hardening, and firewall-based access control-were implemented, reducing the number of high-risk ports from five to one. The results demonstrate that systematic port scanning, when integrated into routine network hygiene, serves as an effective first-line defense for exposure mapping and attack surface reduction. This lightweight scanner features easy deployment, low resource consumption and ease of use, making it particularly valuable for small networks without advanced security infrastructure. We recommend regular scans (for example, weekly or biweekly) combined with active configuration management to enhance overall network resilience."

While PET and CSF biomarkers are useful for detecting Aβ and tau, they are invasive, expensive, and not widely available. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is non-invasive and widely accessible, offering an opportunity for pathology prediction when combined with deep learning. Most prior studies have focused on single-pathology detection, but there remains a need for models that can jointly predict multiple co-occurring pathologies. In this work, we evaluate deep learning models that integrate structural MRI with demographic, clinical, and genetic data to classify six autopsy-confirmed neuropathologies: Aβ, tau, CAA, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and dementia with Lewy bodies. We compare our hybrid deep learning model to AutoGluon, an automated machine learning framework. Our findings support the potential of multimodal AI to enable non-invasive, comprehensive neuropathological profiling in ADRD."

This paper addresses the critical need to align computational throughput with environmental responsibility. We propose a novel framework that uses a neural network autoencoder for task clustering, followed by a multi-objective optimization model to intelligently allocate tasks across a heterogeneous network of 92 HPC centers. While a single-minded focus on speed reduces makespan by $58.5 \\%$ compared to a FIFO scheduler, it offers no energy savings. In contrast, our multi-objective approach reveals a Pareto front of optimal solutions, demonstrating that a minor $10 \\%$ concession in makespan can yield a significant $25 \\%$ reduction in energy consumption, which directly translates to a reduction in carbon emissions based on the regional energy mix. This provides a practical framework for operators to select a scheduling policy that aligns with both performance targets and sustainability goals."

The proposed methodology employs the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA) to globally optimize SVM hyperparameters, including the penalty factor and kernel parameters, resulting in the ISSA-SVM recognition and classification model. Experimental results show that the ISSASVM recognition and classification model can accurately identify different types of vibration events with strong real-time performance and high accuracy. It can also promptly issue alarms for pipeline anomalies such as pipeline leaks and oil theft, greatly improving pipeline monitoring efficiency."

As cancer-related research and guidelines progress at a fast pace, both patients and healthcare professionals face difficulties in accessing trustworthy and up-to-date information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture is introduced using the LangChain framework to solve this problem by combining generative capabilities of LLM and vector-based retrieval. The knowledge used in this chatbot consists of cancer-related articles from NIH and hundreds of research abstracts related to cancer from PubMed. Users can ask the chatbot about cancer-related questions, such as symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. The chatbot generates responses using the retrieved information from the vector database and provides the retrieved sources. RAGAS framework and 50 questions from the MedQuAD dataset are used to evaluate the chatbot’s performance in faithfulness, context precision, answer relevancy, and context recall. The retrieval showed robust performance, but the generation component still struggles. This can be further improved by using pre-trained LLMs and better prompting techniques. Future work will focus on developing better knowledge base and better chunking strategies."

    "abstract": "The gap between central processing units’ performance and network transmission speed is ever increasing, leading to performance bottlenecks in modern computing systems. To address this issue, hardware accelerators are being developed to offload tasks such as network traffic filtering, packet classification, load balancing, and data processing from the CPU. However, the design of such accelerators must be accompanied by thorough verification to ensure correctness and reliability. Unfortunately, there are very few established solutions for verifying data processing units, as this area of research is still emerging. This paper presents functional verification methods applicable to the design of hardware network traffic accelerators, with a focus on a Berkeley Packet Filter virtual machine-based architecture. The proposed approach adapts simulation-based functional and behavioral verification techniques commonly used in general-purpose processor development. We describe the construction of a test bench environment, the generation of meaningful test stimuli, and the use of coverage-driven verification to assess design completeness. Results demonstrate effective detection of design errors and high functional coverage. Additionally, suggestions for improving code coverage, introducing custom verification metrics, and accelerating the verification process through automation are discussed. The presented methodology contributes to more robust and efficient development of hardware accelerators in high-speed networking applications."

We propose a Master-slave Game based Trading Strategy Modeling (MGT) framework, which addresses the gap in existing studies on electricity market trading strategies that insufficiently consider the decision-making role of new energy power generation enterprises. This framework deeply integrates the master-slave game theory with electricity market trading scenarios, enabling the simulation of electricity sales enterprises (leaders) setting optimal electricity selling prices, new energy power generation enterprises (followers) optimizing quotation strategies and electricity sales volumes, thermal power generation enterprises (followers) optimizing power generation volumes, and electricity users (followers) optimizing electricity consumption volumes. Additionally, a hierarchical algorithm can efficiently solve this game equilibrium problem, effectively reducing the risks caused by market uncertainty. Finally, detailed simulation experiments show that under market fluctuation scenarios, when new energy power generation enterprises adopt our proposed optimized trading strategy model MGT, compared with adopting high or low quotation strategies, their profit growth rate can reach up to 202.4%, and daily profits can reach a maximum of 88.041 million yuan. This provides a practical decision-making tool for new energy generation enterprises to respond to complex market environments during the low-carbon transition."

Accurately identifying and promptly addressing the cause of a fault is crucial for restoring power supply. As a classification task, the mainstream methods for identifying the causes of transmission line faults are machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods. However, these approaches exhibit limitations, such as reliance on single-modal data and inadequate feature representation. In this paper, we propose to utilize large language models (LLM) for transmission line fault cause identification. Specifically, we introduce two strategies: (1) A multi-template prompt engineering method, which leverages diverse templates to guide LLM outputs, fully utilizing multi-source fault case data and the generative capabilities of LLM. (2) A hierarchical feature extraction method, where the hidden-layer outputs of the LLM serve as effective feature representations for fault cases. Extensive experiments on the real cases of transmission line fault case identification demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods."

    "abstract": "In the industrial field, pipelines, as critical facilities for transporting energy and water resources, their safe operation is vital to the national economy and people’s livelihood. However, due to long-term fluid scouring, corrosion, and external stress, cracks on the inner wall of pipelines have become major hidden dangers leading to major accidents such as leaks and explosions. According to statistics from the Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI), there are over a thousand leakage accidents caused by pipeline cracks worldwide every year, with direct economic losses reaching billions of dollars. At the same time, they will also trigger chain reactions such as environmental pollution and energy waste. Traditional methods such as manual visual inspection and ultrasonic testing are not only inefficient and costly, requiring a lot of manpower and time for a single inspection, but also have the problem of high missed detection rates, especially being difficult to detect tiny cracks below the millimeter level. With the advancement of Industry 4.0 and intelligent development, the demand for real-time monitoring of long-distance pipelines under complex working conditions in scenarios such as oil and gas fields and urban pipe networks is increasingly urgent. Traditional detection technologies can no longer meet the requirements of high-precision and high-efficiency detection, and more efficient and accurate detection methods are urgently needed. Centering on the actual needs of pipeline crack detection, this paper develops a fully sealed spherical self-balancing robot. The robot integrates a control system, a driving system, and a detection system, dedicated to achieving flexible movement, zero-radius steering, and operation in liquid environments within long curved pipelines. Meanwhile, it breaks free from the constraints of traditional cables by means of 2.4 GHz WiFi wireless control technology, thereby improving the work efficiency of pipeline detection. In terms of control, a combination of a three-axis active stabilization system and PID control is adopted, which, together with the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), processes sensor data. By optimizing state estimation, the stability of the robot’s movement is ensured. In terms of the detection model, a lightweight network L-YOLOv5s is constructed based on YOLOv5s. The network introduces the Ghost Conv module to reduce the number of parameters, combines the SENet module to enhance sensitivity to features, and adds the Channel group structure to optimize feature fusion. Finally, on the premise of ensuring detection accuracy, the model parameters are reduced from $\\mathbf{7. 2 M}$ to $\\mathbf{4. 1 M}$, with the Average Precision (AP) reaching 85.9%."

However, conventional prediction techniques reliant on physical modeling or ray tracing are often hindered by high computational load and limited adaptability in complex propagation environments. To overcome these challenges, this chapter introduces a 3D Transformer-based model termed 3D-STP for short-term spectrum situation prediction. The model effectively integrates geographic structural priors through a novel location encoding mechanism, maintains 3D structural integrity to capture fine-grained spatial-spectral features, and employs hierarchical temporal aggregation for efficient multi-step prediction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach not only achieves high predictive accuracy with naturally smooth spectral transitions, but also significantly reduces inference time compared to conventional numerical methods. These contributions collectively advance the deployment of AI-aided spectrum management in practical dynamic scenarios."

This paper proposes a method for secure communication based on CNN chaotic encryption. This method first selects a third-order cellular neural network system that generates chaotic behavior, and defines an encryption function. Then the sender selects multiple state variables from the CNN chaotic system as a continuous stream of real-time keys input into the encryption function. The confidential information is encrypted using the encryption function to obtain a ciphertext with noise like spectral characteristics. The ciphertext is then sent to the receiver through a public channel. After receiving the ciphertext, the receiver first constructs a full dimensional state observer based on the output signals of the CNN chaotic system and the CNN chaotic system from the sender. Through the feedback and modulation of the full dimensional state observer, the CNN chaotic system for the receiver synchronized with the sender is obtained. Multiple state variables synchronized with the sender are selected as the decryption key of the decryption function, and the inverse operation of the encryption function is performed to decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the recovered confidential information. The experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this paper is correct and feasible. The method proposed in this paper provides good theoretical guidance and technical support for the application of CNN chaotic systems in secure communication, and has good practical value."

It delves into the core role of quantum gates as orthogonal operators and their correspondence with information transmission results through matrix multiplication. Subsequently, it investigates quantum information transmission and dense encoding techniques based on controllable non-qubit gates (CNOT) at different orders. The CNOT gate is represented by a second-order tensor product matrix: when the control qubit is $\\mid 1\\gt$, it performs a Pauli-X operation on the target qubit (matrix: [$[0,1]$, [1, 0]]), otherwise remaining unchanged. By defining the CNOT matrix, Hadamard matrix, maximum entangled state and corresponding multi-order unitary operations (described using elements of the $\\mathbf{S U}(\\mathbf{n})$ group for higher-order quantum system transformations), this study combines density matrix representations of quantum states with quantum measurement theories (such as the mathematical description of projection measurements). It reveals the mechanistic principles underlying quantum information transmission and decryption processes. Through computational verification of quantum state fidelity and transmission success rates across different orders, the effectiveness of cross-order information transmission is demonstrated."

Visualizing radiological characteristics and contamination distribution of such sites would enable efficient exposure management. Gamma-ray imager can measure dose rates, acquire spectrum, and visualize contamination distribution through hotspots.

Additionally, research is being conducted on mounting this equipment on robots for autonomous navigation to prevent human radiation exposure. This study developed a system integrating the miniaturized mini-EPSILON-G which is derived from the previously developed energetic particle sensor for identification and localization of originating nuclei-gamma (EPSILON-G) with LiDAR and a color camera mounted on a quadruped robot. Using this system, we created and evaluated three-dimensional contamination maps by registering 3-D structural information with gamma-ray data.

    "abstract": "In the analysis of objects exhibiting with thin and elongated shape features, such as blood vessels or plant roots, the extraction and utilization of their medial axes prove advantageous. A medial axis is defined as the set of sphere centers that touch a surface of the object at two or more points. Since the media axis of an elongated objects shows a curve-like appearance, it is possible to compute the object's thickness and topology with it. Many existing methods for extracting medial axes from 3 dimensional images (volumetric data) obtained from, for instance X-ray CT scanning, perform voxel-based computation on the data. However, a voxel-based image processing for extremely elongated objects poses challenges, due to its diameter of just a few voxels and tendency of low contrast. It ends up to instabilities in computation of medial axes or generation of unsmooth curves. For overcoming these difficulties, we propose to first approximate the intensities of volume data with spherically supported functions to generate a continuous scalar field. Spherically supported functions is a set of local approximation functions whose supports have spherical shapes and cover the entire region of interest. The global continuous approximation function of intensity is obtained as a weighted sum of the local approximation functions. Nest, the medial axis is extracted which is defined as the set of maximum points of the global approximation function. This approximation strategy achieved a medial axis computation with noise robustness. We applied this algorithm to simulation data of cylinders and X-ray CT data of plant roots. The results indicated that the medial axes were successfully extracted for isolated objects, while some erroneous detections occurred around parts in close proximity."

Gating techniques often struggle with compensating for irregular motion, as they assume periodicity of motion and often require hardware (e.g. belts). To this end, we have developed a maximum likelihood motion and activity (MLMA) reconstruction method for gate-less non-rigid motion correction. The MLMA method alternates between motion estimation and image correction steps. Motion is estimated using the MOTUS framework. The motion model (i) compresses motion with B-splines bases, (ii) exploits spatiotemporal correlation of motion with a low-rank model, and (iii) enforces smoothness with spatial motion-field regularization. The MLMA method can estimate and correct irregular 3D motion at high frequency (500 ms), and was validated in silico and on patient acquisitions. The contrast recovery was improved in silico, with visual improvements in simulations and clinical images."

Although Monte Carlo simulations provide accurate and reliable dose estimation, considerable computational time and cost limit their clinical application.

PET and CT images were adopted as the input of the CM to provide the required information of radioactivity and physical density distributions for internal dose calculation. Whole-body dose maps calculated using the multiple voxel S-value method with 24 tissue-specific voxel dose kernels derived using MCNP simulations were used as the ground truth for model training and validation. Quantitative evaluation showed a mean absolute percentage error of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.0170 \\pm 0.0122$</tex> and a mean structural similarity of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.9891 \\pm 0.0066$</tex>, reflecting the consistency between the generated and reference dose maps.

The next generation of immersive media services will require multicasting data from satellites to large groups of receivers with stringent latency and quality-of-service (QoS) demands. This paper proposes a large-language-model (LLM)-driven orchestration framework that translates broadcaster intents into optimized multicast network slices spanning ground and space resources. Building on the concept of computing-power networks (CPNs), the framework integrates compute-aware routing across GEO, MEO and LEO links, enforces delay-aware multicast constraints using an integer-linear-program formulation, and leverages LLM to adaptively admit multicast groups under resource constraints. A federated fine-tuning mechanism combined with a blockchain audit layer enables continuous improvement of the LLM while preserving data privacy and providing human-interpretable audit trails. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method reduces end-to-end latency and energy consumption compared to traditional heuristics, while increasing the number of admitted multicast requests."

However, the random communication data carried by OFDM results in variability in the sidelobes of its ambiguity function (AF), which severely restricts the improvement of the overall performance of ISAC systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bit inversion probabilistic shaping (BI-PS) scheme for photonics-aided MMW ISAC systems. By employing an amplitude bit mapping mechanism innovatively, the scheme dynamically adjusts the probability distribution of constellation points, allowing for seamless conversion between quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK). To validate the effectiveness of the BI-PS scheme, the photonics-aided 40-GHz MMW ISAC simulation and experimental systems were established. Results show that adjusting the shaping strength effectively regulates the communication rate and the sidelobe level. Furthermore, a unified metric, sensing estimation rate (SER)-generalized mutual information (GMI), is intended for the quantitative analysis of ISAC, which clearly reveals the dynamic tradeoff between the communication and sensing rate."

It was found that a detector angular coverage of two-thirds yielded images of comparable quality to a full-ring detector."

    "abstract": "The detection of annihilation photons using microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs) based on Cherenkov radiation can theoretically break through the time resolution limitations of positron emission tomography (PET) detectors. However, the signal amplitude fluctuations of this detector scheme are relatively large, making it susceptible to the Time Walk effect in advanced timing applications based on this scheme. In this study, we developed a dual-module platform based on self-developed lead glass integrated window multi-anode MCP-PMTs combined with matched electronics, and investigated a Time Walk correction method feasible for system-scale applications. Based on the pulse width difference between coincidence events, we obtained the time walk correction parameters and performed time walk correction on the time-of-flight (TOF) information. Without any event loss or additional calibration process, the coincidence time resolution (CTR) was improved from 285 ps to 128 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM), and the reliability of this correction method was verified."

    "abstract": "Near real-time assessment of a PET scan is an important way to improve patient throughput. Technologists typically use reconstructed images to decide if they need to potentially re-acquire the scan. Current reconstruction methods (based on iterative algorithms) can take several minutes (especially for long axial FOV scanners) to complete, leading to an increased waiting time postacquisition. This abstract explores the use of end-to-end deep learning (DL) as a fast and nonquantitative method to potentially display near real-time updates during the acquisition. We investigate the use of a network (which we call ultraFastPET) that has been trained to take histoimages as input, and with non-attenuation corrected (NAC) MLEM reconstructions as targets. We show results for step-and-shoot data as well as near real-time updates for a continuous bed motion (CBM) scan in progress. We show that the ultraFastPET inference time is fast (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 4$</tex> seconds on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 for a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$220 \\times 220 \\times 645$</tex> histo-image), and this could potentially be optimized further and included in the current acquisition workflow for scan assessment."

    "abstract": "A previous study demonstrated that the 45° tilted SiPM configuration with sparse arrangement effectively reduced the number of SiPMs while maintaining good DOI resolution. However, its ability to achieve sub-250 ps timing resolution has yet to be verified. We developed a TOF-PET detector based on 45° tilted SiPMs with a multiplexed readout scheme and a high-frequency timing circuit. The detector comprises a 44 LSO crystal block optically coupled to 23 top and 3 2 bottom SiPM arrays. A resistive charge division circuit was used to reduce the number of readout channels, and summed timing signals were amplified through RF amplifiers and balun transformers. To minimize light loss from the uncovered regions of entrance surfaces due to the sparse SiPM arrangement, an enhanced specular reflector (ESR) film was applied. Furthermore, depth-of-interaction (DOI) correction was applied to improve timing performance. The 45° tilted detector achieved clear identification of all 16 crystal elements regardless of ESR coverage. The configuration with ESR demonstrated improved energy and timing resolution, yielding an average coincidence timing resolution (CTR) of 246.8 ps FWHM and energy resolution of 18.7 % FWHM at bias voltage of 48 V. Compared to a previous non-multiplexed design (CTR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$CTR ~411 \\text{ps}$</tex>), the proposed design significantly enhanced timing performance with only slight degradation in energy resolution.

    "abstract": "Photogrammetric point clouds have emerged as a cost-effective solution to urban environment perception and scene understanding, significantly advancing recent research in urban-scale 3D semantic segmentation. In contrast to well-explored indoor and road scenes, urban-scale photogrammetric point clouds exhibit more complex spatial geometries, richer texture details, and pronounced multi-scale disparities between background environments and foreground objects. These challenges demand neural networks with enhanced spatial, low-level, and multi-scale learning capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Scale Pyramid Network (MSPNet), a conceptually streamlined, end-to-end network for semantic segmentation of urban scenes. The proposed MSPNet comprises three key components: (i) the Ellipsoid Spherical Position Embedding (ESPE) module, which leverages learnable ellipsoid queries and spherical harmonics, rather than using a fixed ball query and a linear combination of spatial coordinates, to explicitly model position embeddings and effectively capture intricate geometric relationships; (ii) the Top-Down Information Retrospection (TDIR) module, which establishes hierarchical semantic guidance through retrospective pathways, enhancing structural consistency across features at different levels, and (iii) the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Fusion module, which applies matrix rank constraints during multi-scale feature fusion to decompose high-level semantics into low-rank subspaces, alleviating multi-scale semantic confusion. We have conducted extensive experiments on several established urban-scale photogrammetric point cloud segmentation benchmarks, including, HRHD-HK, SensatUrban, and UrbanBIS. The experimental results demonstrate that MSPNet achieves significant improvements across these benchmarks, highlighting the superior ability to accurately segment urban scenes and the potential to advance urban environment perception and scene understanding."

Previous studies have demonstrated that a unique inversion of the nonlinear dual-energy CT (DECT) imaging model is only guranteed if the Jacobian determinant of the system is nonvanishing. Projection based basis material decomposition, which traditionally requires measurements with two different x-ray spectra, can be done with a conventional CT dataset supplemented by a pathlength conservation constraint. The Jacobian determinant for the single-energy CT system is derived and data is simulated for an object containing water and either iodine (25 mg/ml) or gadolinium (39.5 mg/ml) contrast agent. Vanishing determinant values are identified for multiple source spectra which are realistic to clinical diagnostic x-ray tube settings. The result indicates nonunique mappings from tranmission fluence measurements to material pathlengths are likely to exist and can diminish the accuracy of reconstructed basis images."

    "abstract": "This work presents an evaluation method for assessing the significance of a structure in a reconstructed image for low-dose CT. Due to severe noise, the reconstructed images often contain artifacts. It is important to distinguish real structures from such artifacts. For this purpose, quantifying structural uncertainty is required. One way to evaluate the structural uncertainty is to estimate the covariance matrix of the pixel values. However, it is computationally intractable especially for high-dimensional images, i.e., large-format images. Previous studies suggested the use of the highest posterior density (HPD) to define a credible region. Using the credible region, significance of the structure in the reconstructed images can be evaluated through hypothesis testing: If images without the structure fall outside the credible region, the hypothesis that the true image does not contain the structure is rejected, confirming its significance. The present work expands this method and adapts it more appropriately for low-dose CT. To determine the threshold with which the significance of the structure is evaluated, the chi-square distribution was adopted. In addition, the chi-square was calculated using only the area related to the structure under scrutiny. These modifications provide a more stringent threshold, allowing for more appropriate evaluation of image structures. The feasibility of this method was evaluated and confirmed through image reconstruction simulations."

However, the practical application of micro-CT in histopathological examination faces several challenges, including limited soft tissue contrast and long scanning times, requiring improvements in both hardware and software. However, commercial micro-CT scanners are generally closed systems and not optimized for soft tissue imaging, making customization difficult. We aim to develop a custom-built, highly tunable micro-CT system designed to enable soft tissue imaging. Furthermore, to enhance accessibility and promote potential clinical application, the prototype was constructed as a compact, benchtop-sized, and cost-effective system.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex optimization tools. To facilitate the evolutionary process, T-ELLM interacts with a sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the relationship between device selection and learning performance. This developed virtual environment reduces reliance on real-world interactions, thus minimizing communication overhead while refining the LLM-based decision-making policy through group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis proves that the discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits robust adaptability to environmental changes."

    "abstract": "Multimodal sarcasm detection aims to determine whether sarcasm exists in the interplay between text and accompanying images or audio. Effectively exploiting commonsense knowledge is crucial in multimodal sarcasm detection. However, previous methods only utilize the inherent attributes within modalities to construct superficial inconsistencies. They fail to fully leverage commonsense knowledge and implicit sarcasm cues and cannot uncover the deep contradictions between modalities. Accordingly, we propose a novel model named the Knowledge and Emotion Enhanced (KEE) model, which enhances sarcasm detection by integrating commonsense reasoning and cross-modal emotional contrast. Specifically, the KEE model leverages a generative language model to infer commonsense knowledge from the visual modality. It then selects highly relevant knowledge phrases through an attention mechanism and integrates them with text embeddings via a gated weighting mechanism to reveal sarcastic clues behind literal semantics. Additionally, the model captures emotional polarity inconsistencies across modalities and optimizes detection through a joint distribution framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the KEE model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."

Theoretically, scintillators emit visible light proportional to energy deposition, which depends on both energy and activity of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides. By normalizing the SLO of the inorganic scintillator with that of the plastic scintillator, the activity dependence can be eliminated. Since the resulting SLO ratio becomes exclusively dependent on gamma-ray energy, radionuclide identification can be achieved through simultaneous measurement of SLOs from both scintillator types. To validate this methodology, we have developed fiber-optic radiation sensors incorporating these dual scintillation materials. Additionally, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code simulations were performed to establish correlation between experimental and computational SLO ratios.

    "abstract": "The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab intends to search for the neutrino-less charged-lepton Flavor violating conversion of a negative muon into an electron in the presence of a nucleus. According to the Standard Model of Particle Physics this process, in which a muon transforms into an electron without a neutrino, is predicted to be extremely rare, practically non-existent through the usual forces. Therefore, if this process were observed it would indicate the presence of new physics beyond the SM. The goal of the Mu2e experiment is to improve the current experimental limit on the neutrino-less muon-to-electron conversion by four orders of magnitude. The measurement will be performed at Fermilab (USA) where the detector, which comprises a tracker followed by an electromagnetic calorimeter and is surrounded by a cosmic ray veto, is under construction. The calorimeter will be located inside the cryostat and, the readout electronics are housed in crates mounted on the external surface of it. This is a very harsh environment. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the expected radiation levels on the individual components by integrating the expected fluxes for the entire Mu2e data taking period and applying appropriate safety factors as requested. The readout it has been subjected to numerous test campaigns to survive and to operate reliably of up to 5 years. The Mu 2 e calorimeter readout electronics was validated for operation in high-vacuum and under 1 Tesla magnetic field. An extensive radiation hardness qualification campaign, carried out with photons from Co-60, 14 MeV neutron beams, and 200 MeV protons certified the read-out design to substain doses up to 30 krad, neutron fluences up to 10E12 n (1 MeV eq.) /cm2 and very low numbers of single-event effects occurrences. The detector is currently being installed. This paper reviews the qualification campaigns and quality assurance procedures performed on the readout electronics"

These photons are mostly re-absorbed within the same SPAD or region of the device that are inactive, but a few of them may trigger avalanches in neighboring SPADs or escape the device. The former case is referred as (internal) cross-talk and the latter can lead to the external cross-talk phenomenon should one or more escaping photons be detected by another device. The case where an escaping photon is detected by the same device is folded into (internal) cross-talk in our context. External cross-talk is a system level phenomenon because it involves several processes: photon emission, transport and detection, and as such it is detector dependent. In this paper, we will focus on a test experiment called Light only Liquid Xenon (LolX), We will show what we understand and don't understand about external cross-talk and attempt to extrapolate to any detector system."

The diffusion behavior and retention time of iodized oil within the tumor significantly influence the effectiveness of radiosensitization treatment. Therefore, in practical applications, it is desirable to quantitatively analyze the dynamic distribution and concentration changes of iodized oil within the tumor in order to evaluate its efficacy in radiosensitization. The development of spectral CT provides an effective approach for the quantitative analysis of iodized oil. In this study, spectral CT was employed to perform quantitative imaging of iodized oil. Based on material decomposition algorithms, two groups of iodized oil with different concentrations were compared over time to observe sedimentation changes and to quantitatively estimate the distribution and concentration of iodized oil. The results demonstrated good accuracy, thereby confirming the feasibility of spectral CT in quantitative imaging of iodized oil and providing both theoretical and experimental foundations for further research."

    "abstract": "The global health burden of cardiovascular diseases, including MI (myocardial infarction), CAD (coronary artery disease), heart arrhythmias, cerebrovascular disease, and HF (heart failure), is substantial. As a primary cause of mortality, there is a pressing need for continuous and real-time heart monitoring to identify and treat irregular heart rhythms. PPMs (permanent pacemakers) constantly monitor the heart’s spontaneous electrical activity and only activate when it is either defiant or absent. The PPMs under investigation in our research are special implantable biosensors and biotransducers with nanoscale components. The PPMs do not generally contain biochemical reactants but they interact with physiological fluids to be considered as biosensors, and nanobiosensors if they encompass nanomaterials, as for our case. The objective of this study is to determine the reliability of PPM structures that have been implanted in patients who are suffering from one of the cardiovascular diseases over time. Even though the PPMs have been certified for the above use, however, natural patient conditions such as changes in body posture, temperature, or even changes in metabolic demand, can affect their operating modes. The sidewall roughness surface of PPMs is analyzed using atomic force microscopic 3D structural reconstruction, which is based on the grey images of PPMs from CT scanning for each patient. The angular equivocation (also known as angular entropy) approach is implemented to quantify the uncertainty in the distribution of edge or gradient orientation in PPMs images. Then, in order to address nonlinearities and interactions caused by metallic components in the PPM that introduce harmonic and distortions from biological tissues and device motion, we have conducted a bispectral analysis followed by contour representation plots. Different results obtained are of interest for monitoring the state of implantable devices in activity based on CT cardiac examinations in order to preserve the patient’s extended life."

To overcome this limitation, we derive a closed-form ZZB for DOA estimation by leveraging the additive quantization noise model (AQNM). The proposed bound yields a unified expression that encompasses fully quantized, mixed-resolution, and unquantized observation scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a generalized approximation framework based on a beamforming perspective, which enables the proposed ZZB to capture both linear quantization gain and quantization noise effects. Unlike existing bounds, the derived ZZB is valid for arbitrary quantization resolutions and reveals the distinct influence of both the quantization bit depth and the number of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) on the overall MSE. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and practical relevance of the proposed bound, highlighting its superiority over existing lower bounds."

Feed-forward neural networks, with highly pre-processed inputs, are proposed to accelerate analysis by identifying the most appropriate causal radioisotope from a library of known gamma emissions. This method compares the possible assignments of a spectral peak in pairs, then aggregates the results of all comparisons to reach a final decision. Inputs to the neural network are highly pre-processed to highlight the characteristics most relied on by analysts when making a manual assignment to give an overall accuracy of 88.3 %. This accuracy shows a 6 % decrease when analyzing peaks with multiple possible solutions. The neural network has been shown to be radionuclide insensitive, with minimal accuracy loss when exposed to radionuclides that were not included in its training dataset. Alongside testing on historical data, an opportunity to assess the efficacy of this approach on a live trial will be considered and presented."

SiPMs have several advantages, but also potential issues that must be considered, such as: i) temperature-dependent gain, ii) a finite number of cells, and iii) high output capacitance. This transition requires an in-depth study, to build high-performance arrays. In the first phase of our work, we modeled and simulated the generation of photons from radiation detectors and their interaction with a SiPM matrix. We quantitatively identified aspects of non-linearity due to the finite number of cells and the non-homogeneity of the breakdown voltage to understand why, at high energy, the energy resolution that we measure is always worse compare to the one predicted by the Poisson statistical model. We determined that, in addiction to the electronics noise and the dark count rate of the SiPMs, an energy-proportional error becomes significant for energies higher than a few MeV. This non fundamental error term maybe associated with at least three factors: SiPMs temperature variation, SiPMs breakdown voltage non-homogeneity, and finite number of SiPM cells. We performed experimental measurements to establish the relative importance of each of those factors. The results show that the most significant contribution comes from the often neglected SiPM breakdown voltages variations. As the next step towards the development of our large-volume, SiPM based, scintillator array, we are going to design a SiPM readout system able to compensate these unavoidable variations in the breakdown voltage levels, to minimize this effect."

However, challenges such as limited battery replacement capability and unstable underwater communication severely constrain their reliability and efficiency, with the routing void problem emerging as a key bottleneck. To address this issue, this study presents VPNC, a Void-avoidance and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Non-uniform Dynamic Clustering routing protocol. The proposed method embeds void node evaluation into the PSO fitness function, jointly optimizing cluster-head selection and void avoidance by considering residual energy, node depth, and node degree. A cooperative inter-cluster transmission mechanism between cluster heads and gateway nodes ensures balanced load distribution and extends network lifetime. Moreover, an accelerated Dijkstra algorithm incorporating hop count, residual energy, and distance metrics is developed, along with a traversal termination principle to enhance routing efficiency. Simulation results show that VPNC achieves substantial improvements over existing clustering protocols, reducing the proportion of void nodes and improving network lifetime and throughput by at least 20.40% and 37.38%, respectively. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of VPNC in maintaining energy efficiency and long-term stability under challenging underwater acoustic environments."

    "abstract": "Air pollution monitoring remains a critical environmental challenge requiring reliable analytical tools. This study evaluates a hybrid CatBoost–CNN framework for multi-class air-pollution level classification, applying a well-established ensemble learning concept to the environmental monitoring domain. The novelty of this work lies in adapting and validating feature-level stacking for heterogeneous, imbalanced ecological data and demonstrating its applicability within automated air-quality measurement systems. The study is based on open data from the Central Pollution Control Board of India covering 2015–2020, with over 29,000 daily observations across 26 cities. Data preprocessing included missing-value imputation, log-transformation of skewed features, scaling, and class balancing with SMOTE. Three classical models (logistic regression, SVM, CatBoost) were implemented and compared with neural network architectures. CatBoost achieved the best performance among classical algorithms (F1-macro = 86.4%). The hybrid CNN model reached an average accuracy of 90.1% and F1-macro of 89.4% across five stratified folds, surpassing both standalone CatBoost and CNN baselines. The results confirm that combining boosting-based probabilistic outputs with convolutional feature extraction enhances classification stability and accuracy for noisy, imbalanced air-quality data, supporting the integration of such hybrid analytics in environmental monitoring workflows."

Cognitive indicators based on the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy of Anderson were used to develop the instrument. The process of development included content validation by six experts, reliability testing with 50 students, and item analysis. The results showed the scale had strong validity (Aiken’s V = 0.84), good reliability (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.81) and reasonable item discrimination and difficulty. Analysis of distractors also provided evidence for the functionality of most test items. The electronic format facilitates interactive and scalable evaluation according to national curriculum objectives and worldwide trends in geographic education. This instrument fills a longstanding void in geography assessment by providing a deep theoretical and methodological instrument to assess analytical thinking, and by providing support for incorporating the assessment in digital environments. Further research should extend application to varied educational settings and integrate more process-oriented assessment forms to enhance the development of digital assessment in geography."

    "abstract": "With the rise of cloud-native technologies, containers, microservices, and service mesh have become the foundation of digital business transformation. Unlike traditional monolithic systems, microservice architecture enables finer service granularity, higher availability, and stronger scalability, yet it also brings challenges for efficient continuous delivery under massive and frequent updates. To address this, this paper investigates the design and implementation of a continuous delivery strategy based on service mesh. We first propose a multi-indicator evaluation model using a multivariate sigmoid function and an intelligent decision-making model based on Thompson sampling, which integrates service performance evaluation with delivery decisions to support multi-version, multi-indicator scenarios and enhance automation. Furthermore, we develop service mesh-based tools for traffic control, including customizable routing rules through proxy container mode, traffic injection with parameterized settings, and service call relationship discovery for visualized control. Finally, we design a microservice platform controller for declarative management of delivery experiments, together with a Git-based synchronization repository and a GitOps-driven workflow covering deployment, updates, and decision-making. Overall, the proposed approach improves the accuracy of performance evaluation, optimizes resource usage, strengthens traffic flexibility and visualization, and achieves efficient, reliable, and automated continuous delivery for microservice applications."

    "abstract": "To tackle the challenge of time-varying channel fading induced by Doppler spread in Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) systems under high-mobility scenarios, this paper proposes a Gibbs sampling-based Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) channel estimation algorithm.By leveraging the inherent channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler domain, the algorithm establishes a hierarchical Bayesian model. Initially, Gibbs sampling is employed to efficiently explore the posterior distribution of the sparse channel. This approach yields a precise estimation of channel gain statistics while circumventing the computationally intensive matrix inversions required by conventional methods. Furthermore, a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator is seamlessly integrated with the sampling outputs, enabling the adaptive adjustment of the prior model via a dynamic hyperparameter optimization mechanism. Lastly, a modular design facilitates parameter optimization and effectively mitigates error propagation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances channel estimation accuracy and lowers the system’s Bit Error Rate (BER) when compared with existing approaches. It exhibits superior robustness, particularly in complex channel environments, effectively resolving the estimation challenges posed by Doppler shifts in OTFS systems."

Simulation results reveal that the multi-membrane configuration achieves remarkable performance metrics, with a sensitivity of -30.67 dB V/Pa and an SNR of 80.18 dB(A), representing substantial improvements over traditional microphone designs. The developed methodology provides an effective framework for optimizing high-performance MEMS microphone architectures, offering valuable insights for both academic research and industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, yet they often struggle with factual accuracy, knowledge reasoning, and suffer from “hallucinations” in knowledge-intensive scenarios due to fragmented or insufficient knowledge. To address these limitations, this research proposes a comprehensive framework for domain knowledge graph construction, completion, and linking based on large language models. The core technology encompasses two main modules for construction: knowledge graph generation from unstructured text using prompt engineering, and a multi-layered verification mechanism including semantic alignment with authoritative sources and a multi-agent verification system. For enhancing the knowledge graph, two completion methods are introduced: random sampling completion to address initial sparsity, and multi-hop path-based completion to uncover deeper, latent relationships. Furthermore, to integrate knowledge across diverse domains, novel semantics-based and structure-based linking technologies are developed, enabling the establishment of connections between knowledge graphs from different fields. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a specialized multi-task dialogue test dataset was constructed, comprising Entity Attribute Question Answering, Multi-hop Question Answering, and Cross-domain Question Answering. Experimental results, utilizing Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, demonstrate significant performance improvements across all tasks, particularly for smaller models, showcasing the framework’s ability to enhance LLM accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and improve reasoning capabilities in knowledge-intensive dialogue."

To address this issue, we present a fine-grained voice access control architecture that integrates large language model-driven detection with feature-level encryption. The proposed design consists of three layers: a detection layer that leverages large models to capture both explicit and implicit sensitive information for dynamic privilege management; an encoding layer that transforms speech into a high-dimensional feature space to enable fine-grained control; and a reconstruction layer that employs an enhanced generative adversarial network to produce speech reconstructions aligned with user privileges. In contrast to conventional methods, our approach applies a single feature-level encryption, thereby reducing storage and transmission overhead while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate robust sensitive content detection, high-fidelity speech reconstruction, and an effective balance between privacy protection and usability, offering novel insights into secure and adaptive voice access control."

Starting from the demands of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts. Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity. This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level."

The study compares the performance of the Farneback algorithm on different computing architectures, specifically focusing on a CPU (AMD Ryzen 9 4900H) and a GPU (nVidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti). The results demonstrate that GPU-based parallel computing significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of the algorithm, achieving speed improvements of up to 8.791 times compared to CPU processing, particularly in real-time applications with varying video complexities. For example, videos processed with a static camera and a small number of moving objects showed a frame rate increase from 0.953 frames per second on CPU to 7.431 frames per second on GPU. The study provides insights into the practical implications of using GPUs for optical flow analysis, emphasizing their superiority in processing high-complexity video data compared to traditional CPU-based systems.

    "abstract": "Action recognition in videos remains a formidable challenge due to the intricacies of modeling multi-scale spatial and temporal dynamics. This study introduces a novel dual-path network architecture, termed Graph Convolution Combined with Image Pixel Information Networks (GCCIN), which synergistically integrates pixel-level image features and graph-based structural representations to achieve robust multi-scale action recognition. This approach provides a new paradigm for combining graph convolutional networks with pixel-based feature extraction. The proposed framework processes video frames through two complementary pathways, a convolutional pathway that employs ResNet18 to extract pixel-level features from a randomly sampled subset of grouped video frames, thereby reducing computational complexity while enhancing model robustness. A graph-based pathway that leverages Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) to model spatio-temporal relationships, incorporating a novel joint partitioning strategy to handle multi-scale joint inputs. The features extracted from both pathways are fused to perform action classification. To further improve accuracy, an enhanced variant, GCCIN-A, transforms the graph neural network outputs of ST-GCN into an attention mechanism, which is applied to the convolutional pathway to augment its comprehension of spatio-temporal regions. This method capitalizes on the efficient computation of adjacency matrices in joint processing and transfers this advantage to the convolutional pathway, enabling it to capture spatio-temporal attributes and achieve feature alignment during fusion. Extensive evaluations of benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCCIN-A achieves top-1 accuracy of 80. 27%, 96. 31%, 87. 62%, and 65. 95% on the test sets of HMDB51, UCF101, Sports-1M, and Something-Something v2, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods."

In this paper, we propose a lightweight two-stage refinement framework built upon YOLOv8n to improve its performance on small objects. First, we introduce a P2 detection head with bilinear upsampling to enhance shallow features and increase the recall of tiny targets. Second, we design a Refine Head that adjusts classification scores and bounding-box regression of the first-stage proposals, improving precision and localization stability. Experiments on the VisDrone2019 dataset show that our method achieves comparable overall mAP to the YOLOv8n baseline while providing higher recall on small objects and more reliable detection results. These findings suggest that even lightweight detectors can achieve competitive performance on small-object detection with carefully designed architectural refinements. Looking ahead, we plan to extend this framework with transformer-based refinement and embedded deployment for real-time UAV applications."

This study applies the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining to analyze a three-year incident-level dataset (2021–2023) from Muntinlupa City, Philippines, integrating spatiotemporal analytics, supervised machine learning, and association rule mining. Injury incidents clustered in high-traffic barangays—Alabang, Putatan, and Tunasan—and during weekday morning rush hours, with motorcycles consistently emerging as the most injury-prone vehicle type. Among the classifiers evaluated, Naïve Bayes achieved the most robust performance, with 96.74% accuracy and no false negatives, although some models exhibited perfect scores that may reflect overfitting or data leakage, warranting caution in interpretation. Association rule mining identified frequent vehicle co-occurrence, particularly between motorcycles and private cars, though low lift values suggest weak statistical dependence—indicating that their joint presence in crashes may result from shared exposure in congested traffic rather than direct interaction effects. Cross-validation was performed with care to avoid data leakage, maintaining temporal consistency and excluding post-incident variables from training features. These insights support barangay-level interventions such as motorcycle-exclusive lanes, helmet enforcement, and speed regulation. The study contributes a reproducible, open-source framework for city-level traffic injury profiling and aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 11 by promoting data-informed, inclusive urban transport policies."

    "abstract": "The dynamic and complex nature of modern warfare imposes extremely high requirements on the allocation of firepower. This paper, in response to the dynamic battlefield environment, constructs an accurate environmental model and integrates the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the deep Q-network to design an adaptive intelligent optimization algorithm for firepower allocation. Through simulation experiments, in complex scenarios, the average allocation time of this algorithm is shortened to less than 2 seconds, which is approximately 70% less than the traditional greedy algorithm; the target destruction rate is increased to over 85%, which is approximately 20% higher than the unimproved particle swarm algorithm; the weapon utilization rate reaches 90%, significantly outperforming the comparison algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages in terms of allocation efficiency, combat effectiveness, and resource utilization efficiency, and can effectively adapt to the dynamic battlefield environment, providing strong support for combat command."

    "abstract": "To address the limitations of traditional image edge detection systems-such as slow processing speed and inaccurate edge detail extraction-this paper presents a system for image edge detection and contour extraction based on FPGA. The system employs an EG4S20 FPGA as the control core, an OV5640 camera for image acquisition, and SDRAM for data buffering, enabling real-time processing results to be displayed on a monitor. In terms of algorithm design, an improved edge detection method is proposed. The process begins with image preprocessing through boundary point filling and fast median filtering. Next, gradient calculation is performed via multi-directional convolution, followed by edge thinning using non-maximum suppression. Finally, edge determination is achieved using an adaptive thresholding method based on histogram statistics. This approach effectively mitigates the instability in detection performance caused by fixed thresholds in conventional Sobel algorithms."

    "abstract": "Space weather is widely recognized as a critical factor influencing many aspects of modern human activity, particularly in the fields of communication, navigation, and power supply systems. Its impact is primarily associated with solar events, including coronal mass ejections, variations of the solar wind, and solar radio bursts. These phenomena can induce geomagnetic disturbances, typically quantified by the global Kp-index. One of the most important consequences of disturbances is the occurrence of ionospheric scintillations and geomagnetically induced currents. Both of these effects can significantly degrade the performance of technological systems, with satellite-based navigation being especially vulnerable. This paper presents the results of remote calibration of navigation equipment carried out by the differential method during different time intervals and under varying levels of geomagnetic activity. A comparative analysis of calibration outcomes based on pseudorange measurements is provided. The results clearly demonstrate that the accuracy and stability of remote calibration of GNSS-based navigation equipment are highly sensitive to geomagnetic conditions, highlighting the necessity of considering space weather effects in practical applications."

    "abstract": "A mathematical framework is proposed for studying the process of gas displacement in multilayer systems within a gas reservoir, and a model problem is solved. In the considered problem, the boundaries of the section are unknown, and the boundary conditions are rather general; therefore, it is not possible to directly apply all the previously published methods discussed in the article. Since it is impossible to simultaneously capture both boundaries at a network node, the coefficient-smoothing method is applied. Numerical simulations have shown that the most efficient gas extraction occurs when the initial boundaries of the section are equidistant from the production well. A computational experiment has also demonstrated that, with increasing flow rate, the influence of differences in layer permeability becomes more pronounced. Furthermore, when the boundaries of the section are equidistant from the production well, the residual gas content after water breakthrough is higher compared to cases with unequal initial interface positions."

    "abstract": "We present CRISP, a single-stage alignment framework for mathematical reasoning that optimizes one policy under two complementary signals: an explicit, verifiable reward and an implicit imitation score derived from relative log-likelihood. Rather than heuristic loss mixing, CRISP enforces hard budgets for distributional stability (KL-to-demo) and tail-risk control (CVaR). A lightweight primal–dual controller adapts these budgets online, and a contextual bandit routes mini-batches to RL or SFT to focus interaction where it helps most. In evaluations on MATH500, OlympiadBench, AMC, AIME-2024, Minerva and OOD suites (ARC-C, GPQA-D, MMLU-Pro), CRISP matches or surpasses strong single-stage baselines (e.g., +7.5–8.9 points on ID and +8.1–9.7 on OOD averages), while lowering tail risk (e.g., 7% tail-failure in our default gate) at comparable interaction budgets. This suggests risk-controlled single-stage training is a practical, interpretable alternative to two-stage pipelines for math reasoning."

The technique of data analysis engaged in this study is descriptive statistical analysis in order to illustrate the survey data which is in the form of frequency distribution or percentage. Based on the result of the research, the most frequently used device by mothers for self-directed learning is smartphones. The results also showed that mothers are at the level of \"very often\" for the use of technology in self-directed learning. The presence of technology itself is in the level of \"highly motivated\" for mothers to develop their skills. The study found that technology for education gives positive impacts to strengthen SDL practices and enable women with multiple social roles pursuing their personal and professional growth. Based on these insights, the further research can consider the development of learning programs aimed at enhancing married women self-development."

In this study, we applied Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to analyze EEG-derived functional connectivity (FC) networks, revealing that patients with poor outcomes exhibit higher network density and efficiency. These findings suggest that a network reorganization may be linked to worse prognoses, highlighting the potential of TDA as a complementary approach for brain network characterization in coma assessment."

    "abstract": "Radiomic features derived from CT images can be significantly influenced by varying acquisition settings, posing a challenge to disease phenotype analysis in multicenter studies due to potential confounding effects. This study aimed to systematically evaluate how changes in CT acquisition parameters, including scan mode, tilt, and radiation dose, affect radiomic metrics.A phantom containing 3D-printed textures was scanned on a GE Revolution Apex CT scanner. 12 distinct imaging parameter combinations were explored by varying scan mode (axial vs. helical), image tilt (0 vs. 5 degrees), and dose, with each acquisition repeated once. Volumes of Interest (VOIs) encompassing the texture inserts were manually segmented. From these VOIs, 93 radiomic features, categorized into six subgroups of texture methods, were extracted using Pyradiomics, with a specific focus on first-order features for this analysis.Our findings indicate that helical scanning, when the image tilt was 0 degrees, resulted in lower first-order dispersion metrics compared to axial scanning. The introduction of a 5-degree tilt was associated with reduced first-order dispersion metrics in axial scanning compared to the non-tilt scenario. However, introducing tilt to helical scanning complicated the effect of scan mode; unlike the non-tilt scenario, axial scans with tilt did not consistently exhibit higher first-order dispersion metrics than helical scans with tilt.Understanding the influence of imaging parameter variations—particularly less-explored ones such as tilt—on radiomic metrics is crucial. This knowledge empowers clinicians and researchers to select metrics that are robust and largely unaffected by these variations. In clinical practice, this robust selection is essential for accurately distinguishing true disease diagnoses from false positives that may arise due to differences in image acquisition parameters across studies or centers."

    "abstract": "Spam emails, or emails that you didn’t ask for, are a big problem for digital communication systems because they fill up inboxes, waste time, and put users at risk for phishing and viruses. To keep communication safe and productive, especially for people and businesses that rely heavily on email, spam must be found and filtered quickly. Taking care of this problem can boost productivity, keep private information safe, and make it easier to filter emails by hand.This paper performs a comparative analysis of six machine learning methods for spam email detection: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). We utilize a dataset of 20,000 tagged emails from Kaggle, with 80% of them for training and 20% for testing. We compare how well the models work by looking at their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model did better than the others, with an accuracy of 97.18%, a precision of 95.87%, a recall of 98.26%, and an F1-score of 97.05%. To make it easier to understand, Explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP values and LIME were used. These methods showed that the existence of particular terms and phrases that are often linked to spam was very important in making classification decisions. This made the model’s predictions more clear.The results show that SVM is better at spotting spam and that using XAI approaches can help make models that are more dependable and easier to understand for real-world use."

The study analyzes technological challenges related to the uniformity and removal of the sacrificial layer and discusses possible solutions. Classical and anchor-type movable element configurations, the application of chemical-mechanical and mechanical polishing, and a combined metallization process employing a copper sacrificial layer are examined. The chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) approach provides superior surface planarity and stable geometric parameters of the resonator but requires costly equipment. The copper-based sacrificial-layer technology significantly reduces production cost and can be integrated into standard microelectronic fabrication cycles, although it exhibits lower planarity in bridge regions and demands higher alignment precision and etching control. A comparative evaluation of both fabrication routes demonstrates their applicability for next-generation MEMS pressure sensors, where the choice of process strongly depends on the required trade-off between geometric accuracy, fabrication complexity, and long-term reliability. The obtained results define optimal conditions for forming composite resonators considering the balance among, process reproducibility, and overall manufacturing efficiency."

    "abstract": "Ensuring the reliability and longevity of electrical insulation systems in medium-voltage (MV) equipment is critical for the petroleum and chemical industries, where equipment downtime can cause significant operational and financial losses. One of the primary factors affecting the performance of such insulation systems is partial discharge (PD), a phenomenon that can lead to insulation degradation and, ultimately, failure. Furthermore, corona discharge, a form of electrical discharge brought on by ionization of the surrounding air, also poses significant risks to the safety and reliability of MV systems. This paper explores the critical requirements for corona-free and partial discharge-free performance in medium voltage switchgear, as specified by IEEE C37.20.2 (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and CSA 22.2 No. 31:23 (Canadian Standards Association) standards. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the technical guidelines and testing protocols outlined in these standards, focusing on the criteria for PD inception voltage, permissible PD levels, and the conditions for declaring equipment as corona-free. By providing insight into the standards and best practices for controlling partial discharge and corona phenomena, this paper aims to assist engineers and industry professionals in enhancing the reliability and safety of MV switchgear within their facilities."

Its main task is to accurately match homogeneous geological layers exposed by different wells, which allows for the restoration of their spatial position and formation history. The correlation procedure is based on the analysis of geophysical method curves, such as resistivity logging, gamma logging, acoustic and neutron logging. These data serve as a kind of \"passport\" for the section of each well, reflecting the lithological and physical properties of the rocks. Geologists identify reference horizons – stable, well-expressed layers on GPR curves (for example, clay or carbonate), which can be traced over a large area. By comparing these reference points between wells, specialists \"stitch\" disparate sections into a single stratigraphic scheme. Thus, stratigraphic correlation serves as a fundamental link between primary drilling data and comprehensive interpretation. It transforms point information from wells into a holistic geological picture, which is critically important for assessing reserves, optimizing the location of new wells, and planning field development."

The models considered in this study include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and a feedforward neural network – for predicting flood damage (in thousand USD) using a historical disaster dataset (1900–2025) based on EM-DAT records. We evaluate each model’s accuracy and performance (training time and memory usage). The dataset includes multifaceted features (hazard intensity, socio-economic indicators, etc.), and all models are trained and tested under a consistent pipeline with standardized preprocessing (including numeric feature scaling and one-hot encoding of categorical variables). Model quality is reported using the canonical regression criteria—Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and the coefficient of determination. Across experiments, tree-ensemble approaches, with gradient boosting in particular, delivered the strongest predictive accuracy, whereas the feedforward neural network was less competitive on this tabular dataset. Gradient Boosting slightly outperforms Random Forest in coefficient of determination (0.74 vs 0.73) with the lowest RMSE, and also trains an order of magnitude faster than the neural network. The XGBoost model also exhibits strong performance, comparable to Random Forest. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of existing literature and outline how model choice can impact flood risk assessment."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of cloud computing and modern microservice architectures, the data from intelligent operations and maintenance (AIOps) for information technology systems exhibit complex characteristics such as high dimensionality, massive volume, and dynamic correlations. Traditional warning methods based on static thresholds or simple statistical models are insufficient for the early detection of subtle anomalies and the precise diagnosis of complex faults. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent operation and monitoring data warning and diagnosis framework based on a Large Language Model enhanced Transformer (LLM-Enhanced Anomaly Transformer, LEAT). This framework adopts a twostage structure: In the first stage, the cutting-edge Anomaly Transformer model is utilized to perform efficient unsupervised anomaly detection by leveraging its innovative “Association Discrepancy” metric to capture early deviations in system operation patterns. In the second stage, for the detected anomalous data segments, carefully designed Prompt Engineering techniques are used to encapsulate their contextual information and numerical dynamics, and a Large Language Model (LLM) is invoked for Zero-Shot inference to achieve interpretable Root Cause Analysis. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, comprehensive simulation experiments were conducted on the public large-scale Server Machine Dataset (SMD). The results show that the LEAT framework achieves an F1-score of 0.930 in anomaly detection, which is on par with the current state-of-the-art. In the more critical task of root cause diagnosis, its Top-1 diagnosis accuracy (Precision@1) reaches 0.891, significantly outperforming baseline methods. This research confirms the great potential of the LEAT framework in enhancing the automation and intelligence of intelligent operations and monitoring."

The construction of a multimodal feature encoder is achieved by enhancing ResNet-50 and bidirectional LSTM, with a contrastive learning framework being utilised to optimise the feature space. Simultaneously, the iCaRL memory replay mechanism and the ADWIN algorithm are introduced with the objective of achieving online model learning and concept drift detection, respectively. Consequently, a dynamic category tree is constructed in order to adapt to the iterative requirements of commercial products. Utilising e-commerce product data as experimental samples, the proposed model demonstrates superiority over traditional benchmark models in terms of both classification accuracy and real-time performance. It has been demonstrated that the system is capable of adapting effectively to the core requirements of product category management in e-commerce business scenarios, and providing technical support for multi-modal data-driven category optimisation."

    "abstract": "In nature, advanced organisms often complete complex tasks collaboratively through rigorous role division. In recent years, roles have been widely applied in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance the behavioral diversity of agents. However, most existing role-based MARL methods require predefining the number of roles, which not only demands extensive prior knowledge but also leads to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Role Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DRoL) approach. Specifically, we take learnable role representations as inputs to the hyper agent network and adopt contrastive learning to adaptively learn the role representations of different agents, thereby achieving adaptive role learning. Experiments conducted on the hard and super hard scenarios of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate that DRoL can reach the state-of-the-art performance level."

Unlike conventional methods such as TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words, ALBERT generates contextualized word embeddings that capture deeper semantic relationships within text. Through bidirectional processing, BiLSTM allows the model to incorporate both preceding and succeeding contextual cues, leading to enhanced comprehension of sequential data. To further optimize performance, PSO is utilized to efficiently search for the best hyperparameter configurations. Based on experimental evaluations, the model initially reached 84% accuracy, which was further enhanced to 87% through PSO-based hyperparameter optimization. These results underscore the capability of the hybrid approach to enhance sentiment classification performance and indicate its strong potential for advancing future natural language processing applications."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the advancement of wireless technology, Human activity recognition (HAR) has been widely studied by utilizing the WiFi channel state information (CSI). In non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, the enhanced multi-path effect leads to more complex channel noise compared to line-of-sight(LOS) conditions. Existing methods often suffer from complex architectures, redundant parameters, and reliance on filtering or other preprocessing operations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight HAR network, Wi-Echo, which integrates residual shrinkage and depthwise separable convolution modules to suppress noise without explicit denoising, and introduces the bidirectional temporal convolutional network (BiTCN) for efficient temporal feature modeling to achieve accurate activity recognition. Experimental results show that Wi-Echo achieves recognition accuracies of 99.05% and 99.04% in through-wall and around-the-corner scenarios, respectively, demonstrating robust performance."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a prominent approach for automated code vulnerability detection. However, state-of-the-art models often struggle with complex vulnerabilities due to their inability to simultaneously capture both fine-grained token-level semantics and function-level structural features. To address this limitation, we propose BMGANet, a novel deep learning model that integrates multi-granularity features for effective vulnerability detection. Our framework begins by using Joern to construct Program Dependence Graphs (PDGs) and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), followed by cross-function slicing and code normalization. A BERT-based network then extracts token-level and function-level features, which are further refined by an LSTM and a multi-head attention mechanism to model complex code contexts. These enhanced features are subsequently fused for final prediction. Furthermore, BMGANet is pre-trained on two auxiliary tasks—masked token prediction and inter-code-line logical correlation prediction—to improve its semantic understanding of code syntax and logic. Evaluated on widely-used benchmarks, BMGANet demonstrates superior performance and significantly outperforms existing methods."

We convert unstructured role descriptions into standardized labels across six dimensions, refine them via a scoring–regeneration mechanism, and expand fragmented descriptions into coherent narratives for clearer persona representation. Fine-tuning LLMs on the augmented dataset yields significant gains in factual correctness, consistency, and personalization, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured and enhanced role modeling in conversational AI."

The effect of single-wall carbon nanotubes functionalization with Ni phthalocyanine with a cyclotriphosphazene fragment was analyzed under the same experimental conditions. As a result, an increase in the optical limiting for the composite material was shown compared to its original components. A three-fold increase in the nonlinear absorption coefficient and a two-fold increase in the nonlinear refractive index were obtained at a threshold exposure of laser radiation comparable to that of the original Ni phthalocyanine.

    "abstract": "Wireless charging system is not only a technological innovation, but also a significant force driving the transformation of social life and industrial development towards higher efficiency, safety, and environmental friendliness. To optimize the wireless charging performance of the system, the receiving devices need to provide real-time feedback on its own status information, including its impedance and energy demand. Compared to out-of-band communication methods, network communication mechanisms can avoid additional hardware costs, energy consumption, and spectrum occupation, making them more suitable for large-scale application scenarios in future intelligent IoT. However, existing research has either overlooked or neglected the issue of clock synchronization of receiving devices prior to in-band parallel communication. This significantly impacts the accuracy of parallel decoding in practical systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a network-aware bidirectional clock synchronization mechanism for wireless charging systems. By seamlessly integrating the identification and clock synchronization processes of receiving devices, it not only simplifies the design of network communication mechanisms but also eliminates the need for separate and time-consuming device clock synchronization steps. Simulation results demonstrate that this mechanism not only achieves efficient clock synchronization of receiving devices but also effectively guarantees the success rate of system communication decoding."

However, their accuracy degrades significantly under two-phase flow conditions, with errors reaching up to 80%. This paper proposes a new control system for CMFs that incorporates a fast signal-processing algorithm. The control system implements direct digital synthesis method (DDS) for drive signal formation and matrix pencil method (MPM) for tracking signal parameters. The performance of the control system was validated using mathematical models simulating both single-phase and two-phase flow conditions. Crucially, the two-phase flow conditions were modelled via modified random walk model applied to the natural frequency and the damping coefficient in CMF tube movement equation. The parameter ranges for the model correspond to experimental data for CMF with 15 mm tube diameter operating with a liquid-gas flow at a gas volume fraction (GVF) from 0 to 50%. The results demonstrate that the proposed control system ensures high dynamic performance and accurate operation under both single-phase and two-phase flow conditions across all tested GVF values."

    "abstract": "Coffee is a major export commodity that plays an important role in the economies of developing countries, including Indonesia. However, owing to the decline in quality and quantity of production caused by environmental factors, an efficient quality evaluation system is required. This study aims to improve the accuracy of coffee bean quality detection by modifying the You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4) algorithm by combining the Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) and Manhattan Distance Intersection over Union (MIoU) methods in the loss function. CIoU considers the aspect ratio and midpoint distance, but CIoU itself has obstacles, one of which is convergence at the beginning of training, causing a slow training process because of the use of the Euclidean distance method. To obtain the most accurate results, it is necessary to integrate MIoU, which uses the Manhattan distance method, an improved gradient stability, and a faster training process. The dataset consisted of 400 original coffee bean images (100 per class), which were augmented using Roboflow to 2,000 images to enrich visual variation and improve model generalization. The dataset was collected by taking images of coffee beans using a high-resolution digital camera. The images were taken in a controlled lighting environment, using a neutral background and a top-view angle. Each image contains coffee beans with a variety of shapes and real conditions as found in the field. Experimental results show that the YOLOv4 model with the CIoU+MIoU joint loss function achieves a 7.4% improvement in mAP compared to the baseline model, with significant improvement at high-precision levels. This study contributes a new approach to the development of loss functions for object detection in the field of computer vision."

Large-scale multisite tractometry studies remain scarce, limiting power to detect subtle effects and generalizability. Here, we applied BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) to conduct along-tract tractometry of FA, and axial, radial, and mean diffusivity (AD, RD, MD) across 37 major WM tracts in 148 individuals with BD (mean age=36.8 ± 13.5 years; 48% female) and 258 healthy (37.9 ± 13.7 years; 58% female) controls from 6 international sites from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group. Larger samples led to better detection of group-level effects, supporting the benefits of large-scale data harmonization.

We present an integrated approach based on a petrophysical dimensionless invariant that links transmissibility and storage; the invariant is dimensionalized to permit direct comparison with field tests and standard type-curves. The workflow reconstructs bottomhole pressure histories under variable flow-rate schedules by applying the principle of superposition in time and by explicitly treating early-time regimes (wellbore-storage and pre-radial behavior). For gas wells the formulation uses the standard pseudo-pressure m(p) transform and, where appropriate, pseudo-time scaling to account for real-gas effects. Model parameters (transmissibility – k<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">h</inf> and storage (storativity, φc<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</inf>), are inferred by fitting the reconstructed pressure to observed data; fit quality is reported quantitatively and parameter uncertainty is assessed via sensitivity and bootstrap-style resampling. Validation on synthetic cases and several field datasets shows close agreement between modeled and measured pressure histories and yields stable, physically interpretable estimates of transmissibility and storativity across a range of rate schedules and boundary conditions. The approach bridges regionally used «filtration-capacitive» terminology and internationally standard pressure transient analysis parameters, improving reproducibility and facilitating comparison with conventional well-test analysis for reservoir characterization and operational decision making."

    "abstract": "During the manufacturing and long-term operation of photovoltaic (PV) modules, defects such as micro-cracks, dark spots, and hot spots frequently occur, significantly affecting their performance and lifespan. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of defect detection, this paper proposes an innovative method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Residual White Noise Testing. The proposed approach integrates CNN with residual white noise analysis, where the CNN is utilized to extract deep features from infrared or electroluminescence (EL) images of PV modules, and the residual white noise testing is introduced to perform real-time analysis of the feature maps. This effectively suppresses background noise and false detections, thereby improving defect detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high precision and robustness in PV module defect detection, providing a novel technical approach for quality assessment and fault diagnosis of PV modules."

This study conducts a comparative evaluation of two vision-based deep learning strategies for automated helmet detection. The first is a single-stage object detection approach using YOLOv8n and YOLOv11n, while the second is a two-stage hybrid pipeline that combines YOLOv11n with pretrained convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2 and ResNet50) for post-classification. The dataset, sourced from the Hard Hat Workers Computer Vision Project, was relabeled into \"helmet\" and \"no_helmet\" categories for binary classification. YOLOv8n achieved the highest F1-score of 93%, while YOLOv11n delivered comparable results with strong accuracy and real-time detection capability. In contrast, hybrid pipelines underperformed, with F1-scores not exceeding 48%, despite MobileNetV2 producing high-confidence predictions, indicating overconfidence and misclassification. ResNet50 showed more balanced results but still lagged behind YOLO-only detectors. YOLO models also required under nine minutes of training, compared to significantly longer CNN training times. Overall, the YOLO-only approach offers superior accuracy, efficiency, and deployment simplicity, making it highly suitable for real-time safety monitoring in construction environments."

However, significant challenges persist, including incomplete or duplicated records, invalid identifiers, and limited interoperability with external databases. These issues remain despite various improvements since 2018, such as the integration of Population Identification Numbers (NIK) and the recording of taxpayer phone numbers. Although recent tools such as automated validation mechanisms and real-time quality dashboards, are available, they have not been widely implemented to address systemic deficiencies in regional taxation systems. This study seeks to assess the data quality maturity level of the motor vehicle tax system at the Regional Revenue Agency (Bapenda) of Bengkulu Province using David Loshin’s Data Quality Management Maturity Model (DQM). It further aims to develop actionable recommendations grounded in the Data Management Body of Knowledge (DMBOK). Data were collected through a survey of six key respondents using a 133-indicator questionnaire, with analysis conducted across five maturity levels. The findings indicate that most domains fall within the Defined level, with the highest score in Performance Management (4.23) and the lowest in Data Quality Protocols (3.38). Recommendations include implementing automated validation via the Dukcapil API, developing internal regulations, establishing a data governance team, standardizing data formats, and integrating data quality monitoring into the operational dashboard. This study contributes to the enhancement of data governance in the public sector, particularly within motor vehicle tax administration."

    "abstract": "Pests on green mustard are one of the main problems affecting harvest productivity. Pest detection systems are a relevant alternative solution. CNN have become popular models used for detection systems. In pest detection systems, common CNN models often have limitations in training stability and lack of spatial detail in images, especially in varied pictures. In this study, the authors propose Layer Normalization and Transposed Convolution Layer as alternative solutions to these problems. Layer Normalization can improve training stability and robustness of the model against data variations. The Transposed Convolution Layer is then used for learnable upsampling, making pest detection more precise at the pixel level and enriching spatial features. The researchers also propose the Adagrad optimizer, which focuses on adaptive learning rates that can speed up convergence and model generalization. The dataset come from previous research on kaggle with a total of 1000 records categorized into with pest and without pest, each consisting of 500 data. The results of this research indicate an increase in accuracy for the base model by 4% from 92% to 96%. To strengthen the contribution, the researcher applied architectural solutions into the VGG-16, Nasnet Mobile, and Xception transfer learning models. The use of Layer Normalization and Transpose Convolution with the Adagrad optimizer resulted in an accuracy increase of 1% and 2.5% respectively, from 95% to 96% and then from 93% to 95.5%. Overall, the improvement of the CNN architecture model with Layer Normalization, Transpose Convolution Layers, and Adagrad optimization significantly enhances accuracy for pest detection."

Designed for precise timestamping of single-photon signals in high-rate environments, FastRICH achieves timing resolutions better than 30 ps RMS and supports peak hit rates up to 40 MHz per channel. The ASIC is compatible with various photodetectors, including PMTs, SiPMs, and MCPs, and handles both positive and negative sensor signal polarities. Each channel integrates a low-noise analog front-end, constantfraction (CFD) and leading-edge (LED) discriminators, and a time-to-digital converter (TDC) based on a 1.28 GHz multi-phase ring oscillator. The front-end contributes less than 10 ps RMS random jitter, while the CFD stage maintains jitter below 30 ps RMS for typical input signals. Time-ofArrival (ToA) and Time-over-Threshold (ToT) are measured with bin sizes of 24.4 ps and 390 ps, respectively. The digital back-end features Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), shutter-based filtering, a programmable hit selection mechanism, and time sorting of events to ensure efficient data handling in demanding conditions. Output is serialized using a radiation-tolerant implementation of the Aurora 64b/66b protocol over up to four high-speed links operating between <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$320 \\text{Mbit} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> and 1.28 Gbit/s.

    "abstract": "In real-world applications, time delays and uncertain nonlinearities are inevitable and impose significant challenges in modern control systems. The uncertainties commonly include nonlinear backlash-like hysteresis, external disturbances, parameter perturbation (internal disturbance), measurement noise (white noise), and varying time-delay components. Recently, time-delay estimation (TDE) techniques have gained widespread traction for compensating for nonlinearities in various time-delay control systems. This study evaluates the performance of weighted TDE-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control on a complex, high-order system comprising a third-order system with a repeated pole structure. The concerned system can be regarded as analogous to a conveyor belt or a real-world thermal system. Experimental analyses are conducted to validate the effectiveness of integrating the TDE mechanism and the PID controller, with their respective weighting coefficients, during controller operation for a high-order time-delay nonlinear system under the effects of hysteresis, white noise, system parameter perturbation, external output disturbance, and varying time-delay scenarios. The simulation results, compared with the traditional PID controller, demonstrate that the proposed weighted TDE-PID control method outperforms in terms of improved transient performance characteristics, resilience, and robustness, with negligible steady-state errors. Moreover, stability and sensitivity analyses for the selection of the weighted coefficients are performed for the weighted TDE-PID-controlled high-order time-delay system, thereby further substantiating the validity of the proposed weighted control law. Hence, the results corroborate the applicability of this improved TDE-PID control method for high-order time-delay nonlinear processes encountered in realistic industrial settings."

A critical challenge is offloading UAV communication traffic and migrate services to satellites during network congestion. The decentralized structure, changing link conditions, and limited local visibility make it hard to coordinate service migration and request routing in such dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic graph-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for satellite-aided UAV networks. We formulate service migration and routing as a semantic graph optimization problem, with the objectives of reducing communication delay and increasing network throughput. The framework incorporates two key components: a cyclic message-passing model that enables nodes to infer global network states from limited local observations, and a discrete denoising diffusion model that generates realistic, and dynamic topologies. Our framework leverages semantic feature extraction to further enhance decision-making in routing and service placement. Extensive simulations show that our approach achieves significant reductions in average transmission delay and improvements in the network throughput."

    "abstract": "The effect of the field current and commutation angle parameters on average torque of doubly salient electromagnetic motor (DSEM) is highly mutual coupled at high-speed operation. Hence, it is hard for the conventional methods to realize the simultaneous adjustment of field current and commutation angle to fully utilize the torque capability of the DSEM at high-speed operation. In this paper, a commutation angle closed-loop (CAC) based average torque control method is proposed. Firstly, the effect of the field current and commutation angle parameters on the average torque is analyzed. The characteristics of optimal commutation angle parameters are derived, and the CAC method is proposed to adjust the commutation angle parameters by aligning the phase current intersections with phase back-EMF intersections adaptively. Then, the relationship between the field current and average torque is investigated under the proposed CAC method. On this basis, the variable-step perturbation and observation algorithm and average torque control are proposed to adjust the field current by maximizing the average torque. Finally, the proposed CAC-based average torque control method is verified on the high-speed DSEM drive system. The experimental results indicate that the proposed control method can adaptively obtain the optimal commutation angle parameters and field current simultaneously and realize the maximum torque operation of high-speed DSEM drive system."

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead. This hybrid framework presents a robust and efficient solution for high-quality 3D CT image post-processing."

    "abstract": "Due to the high mobility of tritium, its ability to form tritiated water, and its radiological significance, low-level tritium monitoring is critical for nuclear safeguards, regulatory compliance, and environmental protection. Detecting trace amounts of tritium remains challenging, driving the need for field-deployable systems offering high sensitivity, selectivity, and minimal false positives. We present a technique for high-sensitivity, high-selectivity tritium measurement, which integrates metal-hydride and gas-detector concepts into a compact field-deployable tritium sensor, referred to as MEGA detector. In this detector, sampled-air containing tritium in one of its chemical forms is flown into a gas-proportional counter embedded with a hydrogen-storage metal. Metal-hydride forms from selective absorption of hydrogen/tritium into the metal at optimized isotherms. A quick gas purging flushes out residual air containing any background radionuclides after which the counter is backfilled with working gas. Tritium desorption occurs from appropriately heating the metal-hydride, which releases it back into the counter. Subsequent detector operation in proportional counting mode generates signals induced solely by tritium betaparticles, enabling its selective measurement at 100% detection efficiency. Preliminary studies conducted with palladium thin films coated on stainless-steel substrates demonstrated tritium absorption and metal-hydride formation, and tritium desorption upon heating the metal-hydride. These processes were confirmed using data from both a commercial tritium monitor and a custom MEGA detector. The MEGA detector successfully acquired the pulse height spectrum of tritium beta-emissions."

    "abstract": "With the deep evolution of satellite communication technologies and hierarchical hybrid networks (HHSNs), modern communication satellites have transformed from single-function relay nodes into core hubs enabling global interconnectivity. The dynamic topology, open-channel environment, and resource limitations inherent to HHSN expose satellite routing protocols to the challenges of the Reliability-Security-Efficiency (RSE) trilemma. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of advancements in HHSN routing research, analyzing core technical challenges through the lens of typical application scenarios while highlighting the divergent performance of various solutions under the RSE trilemma. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze the performance of HHSN routing protocols within the framework of the RSE theory. Existing reviews either treat routing merely as a component of broader surveys or lack analysis based on the RSE trilemma framework. Building on our review of HHSN routing protocols, we discuss the topology description and security aspects of HHSN and propose potential directions for future HHSN routing research."

    "abstract": "The efficient operation of synchronous motors requires the implementation of techniques for loss decreasing. In the overwhelming majority of control systems, the developers use maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control, which is a trade-off between simplicity and loss minimization. The developers mainly pay attention to MTPA control in steady-state modes, which are usually the main operating modes of motor drives. However, motors in some applications like automotive, machine tools, etc., operate with numerous transients, thus the implementation of MTPA control in transients is crucial for efficient control in those applications. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for the planning of current transients, which aims for the provision of the trajectory closer to motor MTPA curve. In steady state mode the proposed technique is inactive, however when the control system detects significant change of current command, it activates the planning algorithm. The algorithm detects transient direction (raising or falling current) and defines initial and target points. Then it calculates the ratio between cutoff frequencies of d- and q-axis current PI controllers and changes the gains of the slowest controller. When that transient is over, the algorithm restores the modified gains and becomes inactive. The experimental part proves the feasibility of the proposed technique and demonstrates improved trajectories."

    "abstract": "Image processing is one of the most promising applications for quantum machine learning (QML). Quanvolutional Neural Networks with non-trainable parameters are the preferred solution to run on current and near future quantum devices. The typical input preprocessing pipeline for quanvolutional layers comprises of four steps: optional input binary quantization, encoding classical data into quantum states, processing the data to obtain the final quantum states, decoding quantum states back to classical outputs. In this paper we propose two ways to enhance the efficiency of quanvolutional models. First, we propose a flexible data quantization approach with memoization, applicable to any encoding method. This allows us to increase the number of quantization levels to retain more information or lower them to reduce the amount of circuit executions. Second, we introduce a new integrated encoding strategy, which combines the encoding and processing steps in a single circuit. This method allows great flexibility on several architectural parameters (e.g., number of qubits, filter size, and circuit depth) making them adjustable to quantum hardware requirements. We compare our proposed integrated model with a classical convolutional neural network and the well-known rotational encoding method, on two different classification tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed model encoding exhibits a comparable or superior performance to the other models while requiring fewer quantum resources."

By means of Lyapunov theory, the global asymptotic Stability of the closed-loop system is proven. It allows the use of a classical sliding mode observer (SMO) to remove the mechanical sensor in the control loop despite uncertainties on the resistance and inductance parameters. The analysis of the equilibrium points has made it possible to propose an analytic model of the angular misalignment between the true and the observer rotating frames, responsible for current tracking errors. Experimental tests on a wind turbine emulator (WTE) show that despite up to 100% of error on the resistance and inductance parameters, the impact on the energy production is negligible, proving that the strategy’s performance is robust to high uncertainties."

    "abstract": "Flash radiotherapy (Flash-RT) is an emerging radiotherapy technique whose uniqueness lies in the ability to deliver ultra-high doses to the tumor site in a fraction of a second, which can significantly reduce the damage to normal tissues while ensuring the tumor treatment effect. In order to carry out dosimetric evaluation and verification during X-ray Flash-RT, it is necessary to visualize the spatial dose distribution in the irradiated target. However, as the ultra-fast dose delivery characteristics of Flash-RT, traditional dose measurement and monitoring techniques face significant challenges such as signal saturation effects and substantial measurement deviations. The imaging technique of dose delivery based on the X-ray acoustic effect provides a feasible strategy for online dose monitoring during Flash-RT. By detecting the acoustic wave signal induced by ultra-high-dose-rate high-energy X-rays irradiating the target, the absorbed dose distribution in the target can be quantitatively reconstructed. In this study, the Geant4 program based on the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the process of single-pulse X-rays generated by a 10 MV medical linear accelerator irradiating three representative phantoms composed of different materials, and then the propagation and attenuation process of the induced acoustic wave are approximated based on k-space pseudospectral method. Subsequently, the delivered dose distribution in the phantoms will be quantitatively reconstructed by the acoustic signal sequences collected by an annular array transducer with 128 -element. The experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this online dosimetry technique in the X-ray Flash-RT."

The HADAR is an array of four wide-field-of-view Cherenkov telescopes based on refractive lenses. Each telescope comprises a camera of 18,961 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The telescopes require a real-time hardware trigger system to select images induced by cosmic rays, while rejecting images induced by the night sky background (NSB) to reduce the random trigger rate. This paper proposes an FPGA-based digital trigger system for HADAR, featuring a novel trigger algorithm that exploits the measured charge of neighboring pixels, and a low-complexity system structure that is capable of implementing the algorithm. A prototype trigger system is developed to verify the trigger algorithm, and the hardware performance is tested. The results show that the design achieves a trigger efficiency of 98.02% for valid event samples and an error rate of only 0.7% for invalid background samples with reliable high-speed hardware, indicating that the design is a feasible and efficient solution for the HADAR experiment."

In this work, we incorporated spectrum unfolding to reconstruct the gamma-ray emission spectrum of the spent fuel rods based on gamma-ray spectra measured by CZT detectors, which eliminated the algorithm's dependence on prior burnup data to avoid potential bias in the verification process. We applied the reconstruction algorithm to a VVER-440 fuel assembly and successfully imaged all the fuel rods. We observed a 24 % increase in the difference between the reconstructed activity of water channel and fuel rods when the reconstructed emission spectrum was used."

This is a consequence of the low radiotracer doses and not an inherent limitation of PET, as scanners process events at the millisecond timescale for list-mode protocols. However, conventional reconstruction methods do not exploit this high sampling rate, failing to correct for fast irregular motion, such as in cardiac PET. We hereby propose a method to estimate and correct for motion at an ultra-high-frequency <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(10 ~\\text{Hz})$</tex>, utilizing the projection data of ultra-short timeframes <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(100 ~\\text{ms})$</tex>. It builds upon the Maximum-Likelihood Motion and Activity (MLMA) reconstruction method, incorporating time-of-flight (TOF) on motion estimation for more accurate and local motion. The method is validated on projection data for the XCAT phantom and on patient data. The results show that MLMA is robust, resolving the physiological motion of the heart. We conclude that PET intrinsically has a high encoding of motion even for ultra-short timeframes (100 ms), that MLMA exploits for gateless motion estimation and correction at ultra-high frequencies (10 Hz)."

    "abstract": "Microwave sensors are widely used due to their noninvasiveness and high sensitivity. Most of the studies focus on the design of sensor components and, however, lack exploration on how to build an independent sensor system. This study proposes a microwave multiparameter detection system (MMDS) based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and dual-AD8302. A modified complementary split-ring resonator (MCSRR) works as the passive sensor component. The system is specially designed to handle the environmental influence and work for multiple parameter detection. The PLL driving circuit generates a 0.9–1.4-GHz sweep signal to drive the MCSRR. Then, the insertion loss and phase curve are read out during the sensing process. We quantify and optimize the system noise by establishing a contribution model and propose a compensation model using a neural network for offsetting the influence of environmental temperature and humidity. An evaluation system is built with six indicators: accuracy, linearity, sensitivity, limit of detection (LOD), repeatability, and humidity calibration coefficient (HCC). The measured results show that the MMDS can detect frequency, amplitude, and phase change with an accuracy of 98.7%, 97.2%, and 85.2%, respectively. Empowered by its integrated humidity compensation model, the system demonstrates superior robustness against ambient humidity variations, with an HCC exceeding 92% for frequency, amplitude, and phase detection."

    "abstract": "Reducing radiation dose in positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) is critical, and recent advances in ultra-low-dose (ULD)-CT protocols have enabled up to a 98% reduction in CT radiation exposure. However, this comes at the cost of increased image noise and reduced anatomical detail, which may hinder visual interpretation in some clinical indications. While low-dose (LD) CT, typically used in PET/CT, is not of diagnostic quality, it provides adequate anatomical information for attenuation correction and localization. This study introduces a deep learning-based denoising approach using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cGAN) to enhance ULD-CT image quality. A total of 70 patient scans were used: 51 for training and internal validation and 19 for external validation. Due to slight anatomical mismatches, the model was trained on unpaired two-dimensional slices. Performance was assessed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and multiple image similarity metrics. Results showed that synthetic cGAN-CT images improved SNR and CNR across the lung, liver, and bone, with relative differences to LD-CT under 16%, while ULD-CT deviated by over 60%. Image similarity metrics confirmed that cGAN-CT achieved structural quality comparable to LD-CT. This approach supports substantial dose reduction while preserving image quality for clinical PET/CT interpretation."

Current approaches either reject these events, reducing sensitivity, or accept them with inaccurate positioning algorithms, degrading image quality. We propose a simple machine learning approach to optimize ICS event recovery based on a feed-forward neural network constrained by physical conditions with an hardware-ready architecture. Our approach was validated using Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data from the LabPET II scanners. Results demonstrate a 105% increase in sensitivity while maintaining spatial resolution. This enables reduced scan times or radiation doses while preserving image quality, representing a significant step forward in UHRPET imaging."

    "abstract": "A new technique to measure thermal neutron fluxes was developed. This technique uses a CLLB(Ce) scintillator as an activation detector for neutron irradiation. Taking advantage of the fact that the neutron flux spectrum of a well-moderated neutrons is approximated by the sum of a Maxwellian distribution and 1/E distribution, the thermal neutron flux is deduced from the activities of Cs-134m and Br-80m produced in the scintillator without using the cadmium filter method. The applicability of this technique was tested by measuring a thermal neutron flux using a Pu-Be neutrons source and a paraffin moderator. The result was agreed well with the known thermal neutron flux measured by another method. Thermal neutron fluxes in a thermal reactor can be measured without cadmium filters by irradiating a single CLLB(Ce) scintillator."

    "abstract": "This study presents a method for reconstructing images using data acquired from an active codedaperture gamma imaging system developed for omnidirectional in-situ radiation detection. Image reconstruction was performed using the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm. However, since the MLEM algorithm is based on point estimation, it tends to converge to a specific point as the number of iterations increases. While it responds accurately to point sources, it may produce point-like artifacts when applied to volume sources. In this study, a geometrical model of the active coded-aperture gamma imaging system was developed using MCNPX-PoliMi to support system design and evaluation. A pseudo-random pattern was designed to serve as the coded aperture, with scintillator pixels positioned at the activated region to induce active shadow formation. The system features a cylindrical geometry, and the system matrix was constructed along eight radial directions 45 degree intervals from the center of the cylinder toward its lateral surface. Images were reconstructed using data obtained from each of the eight directional system matrices and then fused to assess the system's capability in detecting and characterizing volume sources with defined shapes."

In the case of the existing computer vision technology about tracking system, these technologies such as KCF, CSK, and MOSSE have low accuracy. In contrast, the computer vision technology about tracking system in this paper shows higher accuracy than the existing computer vision technology. The computer vision technology has Discrete Point tracking based on Fourier Calculation and Local Binary Pattern. The Discrete Point tracking is the computer technology to follow the movement of specific points. But the Discrete Point tracking has disadvantage about the computation speed. So, the Discrete Point tracking in this paper used Fourier Transform to improve the computation speed. The Local Binary Pattern is texture-based region detection technology which analyzes the texture of image captured by camera. So, the Local Binary Pattern is the good method for recognizing the organ part as shown in this paper because it distinguishes the boundaries of the image based on the texture composed of pixel values. Furthermore, this paper shows the different accuracy result between Discrete Point tracking based on Fourier Calculation with Local Binary Pattern and Discrete Point tracking based on Fourier Calculation without Local Binary Pattern. The results in this paper show that using LBP yields higher accuracy than not using it. The mean value about Discrete Point Tracking with Local Binary Pattern is 0.6775. But the mean SSIM value about Discrete Point Tracking without Local Binary Pattern is 0.7472. Therefore, the computer vision technology having Discrete Point tracking based on Fourier Calculation with Local Binary Pattern shows the highest efficiency in terms of accuracy. The tracking accuracy was measured by SSIM."

The three detectors consisted of 12 slabs of 0.96 × 56 × 10 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> in size, with different reflectors between the slabs and different treatments on the front and two end surfaces. The detectors were single-ended read out by a 4 × 16 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array with a row and column summimg circuit. Different monolthic (y) and DOI (z) positions of the detector were irridiated by using a 0.3 mm Na-22 point source and a reference coincidence detector consisting of a single LYSO crystal of 1 × 1 × 20 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>.

Placing black paint on the front and two end surfaces of the semi-monolithic arrays improved both the y and DOI resolutions, but degraded the energy resolution. Detector using the ESR reflector provided similar y and DOI resolutions, and better energy resolution as compared to the detector using the BaSO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</inf> reflector. The two detectors with the front and two side surfaces black painted provided a clear identification of all scintilator slabs of 0.96 mm, y resolutions of ∼ 1.6 mm, DOI resolution of ∼ 2.35 mm and energy resolutions of ≤ 14.8 %, and can be used to develop high resolution small animal and organ specific PET scanners.

    "abstract": "This study presents the design, development, and evaluation of an electron beam imaging system intended for integration into a novel magnetometer platform based on a micro cathode ray tube (mCRT) architecture. The magnetometer employs a low-energy electron beam, operating within the energy range of 500 to 2000 electronvolts <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathbf{e V})$</tex>, as a critical component for detecting minute variations in magnetic fields. Accurate spatial and temporal detection of the electron beam within this energy range is paramount to the functionality and precision of the magnetometer. To address this challenge, we investigated and characterized multiple scintillating materials in conjunction with a high-sensitivity complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensor. Scintillators serve as the electron-to-photon conversion layer, enabling the visualization of the electron beam profile and dynamics. The materials were selected and tested based on several performance metrics, including their scintillation efficiency as a function of incident electron energy, light spread (diffusion) within the scintillator, spatial resolution, afterglow characteristics, and susceptibility to electron-induced degradation over time.Both pixelated and monolithic scintillator architectures were fabricated and subjected to systematic comparative analysis. Pixelated scintillators, typically constructed using optical isolation techniques to confine photon spread, were assessed for their potential to enhance image sharpness. In contrast, monolithic scintillators were evaluated for their fabrication simplicity and higher light yield, though potentially at the cost of reduced resolution due to diffusion. The outcome of this work contributes not only to its target application but also to the growing field of low-energy electron detection and imaging, particularly in configurations where electron sensing via direct detection is impractical due to shallow penetration depths."

    "abstract": "We propose a completely new approach for reconstructing individual tracer images in multiplexed PET (mPET). In mPET using positron plus prompt gamma emitters, missed gamma photons cause crosstalk between the reconstructed images. Previous reconstruction methods account for the missed gamma photons but take very long to converge due to simultaneous estimation of both radiotracers' distribution. This leads to very noisy reconstructed images where there is a tradeoff between achieving low crosstalk and low noise. We present an alternating update method for multiplexed PET reconstruction that alternates between reconstructing the pure positron (e.g. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{18} ~\\mathrm{F}$</tex>) and positron plus prompt gamma emitter (e.g. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${ }^{44} \\text{Sc}$</tex>) -labeled tracer distributions in order to reduce convergence time and improve image quality.

The crosstalk between the two tracers is below the threshold of visual inspection, with measured crosstalk ratios of 0.15 / 0.43 for the previous and 0.06/0.20 for the proposed method. Thus, the alternating update method shows over 2 x the CNR for similar CR while achieving about half of the level of crosstalk between the tracers compared to the previous simultaneous estimation method. It also requires about half the number of total iterations, yielding around 1.5-2x faster reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Noble liquid scintillators, and liquid argon in particular,present a potentially disruptive alternative to conventionalradiation detectors, offering several distinct advantages. One of its most valuable features is the ability to efficiently distinguish between hadronic (neutron) and electromagnetic (gamma) interactions using pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) of the scintillation light. This capability makes these type of detectors particularly well-suited for identifying complex, mixedfield radiation sources, including special nuclear materials. Additionally, liquid argon detectors are highly scalable, allowing for the construction of large-volume systems. The combination of broad detection coverage and strong neutron/gamma discrimination positions this technology as a compelling candidate for radiation portal monitors (RPMs) and a wide range of nuclear security applications,including safeguards and non-proliferation. A Liquid Argon Radiation Monitor (ALARM) is a prototype detector developed at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, targeting nuclear safety and security applications.

Precise simulation modeling is necessary to optimize design of CRI-MCP-PMTs for practical use in TOF-PET systems. In this study, we developed a Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation model of a CRI-MCP-PMT with detailed parameters. The detector geometry and photocathode material were determined based on the commercially available MCP-PMT (R3809U-50, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.), and a 3.2 mm -thick lead fluoride crystal was used as a Cherenkov radiator. Our model incorporated single photon time resolution (25 ps full width half maximum (FWHM)), measured single photon waveform, electrical noise, and fluctuation of the waveform amplitude to generate an analog output signal for timing pick-off. The waveform amplitude fluctuation and electrical noise were modeled with Gaussian functions based on the measured data. We scanned the pulse area window and threshold level of the constant fraction timing to obtain the best CTR. As a result, the simulated CTR was improved as the pulse area increased and the timing pick-off threshold decreased; the best CTR was 29.6 ps FWHM. This result showed good agreement with the experimental result of 30.1 ps previously obtained with almost the same parameters. Our simulator enabled generation of the analog output signal for timing pick-off using the selected CRI-MCP-PMT, which is useful for the design optimization of ultrafast TOF-PET detectors using CRI-MCP-PMTs."

Traditional service composition methods usually overlook the deep connections between services and tasks and cannot effectively utilize the historical composition experience of low-frequency services. To overcome the identified limitations, this work presents a new service composition strategy, N2PW. Firstly, a detailed service task association graph is constructed through node mining to accurately locate the potential connections between services. Then, an initial solution is constructed via a two-layer pointer network (2PN) to enhance the algorithm’s generalization ability and solution efficiency. Finally, the algorithm leverages the local exploitation ability of WOA to optimize the initial solution, further improving the utilization efficiency of low frequency services. Results confirm that the proposed technique outperforms conventional methods with respect to both the quality of solutions and the efficiency of composition."

    "abstract": "This work focuses on one specific aspect of phenomena associated with the electromagnetic radiation generated when a plane, density-modulated electron beam moves parallel to a vacuum-medium interface. In the considered case of a planar interface, such an electron beam gives rise to Cherenkov radiation. Within this configuration, by means of an exact analytical approach, we have derived an upper bound for the intensity of Cherenkov radiation. This theoretical finding is corroborated by the presented results of numerical experiments, which match the predicted intensity limit across a range of beam parameters and material properties. Obtaining a closed-form analytical solution to an electromagnetic problem of this complexity is quite rear and thus constitutes a significant result. Not only it deepens our understanding of diffraction radiation phenomena, but also provides a rigorous benchmark for testing and validating various numerical methods."

This problem is particularly acute for unanswerable questions, where models invent answers instead of admitting ignorance. To address this, we introduce a lightweight Generator-Verifier-Reranker pipeline. Our post-processing framework uses a FLAN-T5 model to generate answer candidates, which are then validated by an efficient S-BERT verifier that measures semantic similarity against the source context. A reranker then sorts the verified candidates. Experiments on the SQuAD 2.0, the method achieves a 57.3% Exact Match score at a 0.75 similarity threshold, balancing precision and recall. Results demonstrate significant reductions in false positives, offering a practical solution for deployable, reliable QA systems in resource-constrained environments."

The probable trajectories of the movement of a spot of focused laser radiation along the surface of an object during the synthesis of precision structures are associated with a family of curves, which in mathematics and mechanics have received the common name of epitrochoids. The report analyzes the issues of experimental confirmation of the stated assumptions about the forms of the most probable trajectories of the spot's movement. The report claims that recently published results by researchers from the renowned German metrology institute (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany) actually demonstrate loop-like patterns in the recorded trajectories of parasitic movements of the rotor axis of the spindle of the precision angular comparator WMT-220, characteristic of the so-called shortened epitrochoids. The sizes of the recorded parasitic structures are at the level of several nanometers."

    "abstract": "To provide the wafer stage with a motion control method that ensures both excellent tracking accuracy and strong generalization capability, a neural network-based feedforward control strategy is proposed that employs a gated recurrent unit-patch long term transformer network (GRU-PatchTST) to accurately predict feedforward compensation signals. First, a GRU-PatchTST network is constructed, which utilizes data collected from the wafer stage to precisely predict the feedforward compensation term corresponding to the reference trajectory. Essentially, the GRU-PatchTST network can be regarded as a data-driven model that accurately characterizes the inverse dynamics of the system, thereby serving as an effective feedforward controller. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the prediction capability of the GRU-PatchTST and verify the superior tracking performance of the proposed feedforward control method. The proposed approach not only achieves control accuracy comparable to iterative learning control but also eliminates the need for a cumbersome iterative process. The optimal feedforward compensation term can be obtained from a single rediction, which highlights the practical applicability of the method."

    "abstract": "The voice conversion (VC) model based on autoregression has favorable performance in predicting the Mel spectrum. However, predicting the Mel spectrum of the current frame relies on the Mel spectrum of the previous frame, which results in slower prediction speed and potential frame duplication or omission. In view of the above problems, a non-autoregressive voice conversion model based on Transformer is proposed. The model is mainly composed of multi-head self-attention and Conv1D, which effectively improves the training speed of the model and the speed of predicting the Mel spectrum. However, the model has many problems, such as a large number of parameters and high memory occupation. Aiming at the problems of the Transformer model, a voice conversion model based on the gated attention unit (GAU) is proposed. The gated attention unit integrates the gated linear unit (GLU) and the self-attention mechanism. Compared with the Transformer model, the model has fewer parameters, lower memory occupation, and faster training speed. The subjective and objective evaluation of the two proposed models is carried out on the CSTR VCTK and CMU ARCTIC speech data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed two models have faster training speed, faster prediction speed, and more stable prediction quality while ensuring the quality of the Mel spectrum."

To prevent overfitting, an early stopping mechanism was used, which allowed us to identify the most optimal model indicators. Empirical results on two different test sets show that the model works reliably on literary texts, but demonstrates a noticeable drop in performance when working with texts of various topics. In addition, a comparative analysis of existing solutions is carried out in order to emphasize the relevance of the work done.

    "abstract": "As the pace of deployment of large-scale low-orbit satellite systems continue to accelerate, how to efficiently use this new network architecture to provide edge computing power has became a core issue of concern in industry and academia. Different from traditional terrestrial communication networks, LEO satellite networks, with the unique spatial coverage advantages, can provide a near-instantaneous response of high-bandwidth computing and storage resources for users in any corner of the world, showing great application potential. However, the current research on edge computing in LEO satellite networks are generally based on the idealized assumption that each satellite is equipped with standardized computing resources and service capabilities. This assumption will not only lead to a significant increase in the initial construction cost, but also may lead to unnecessary redundancy and over-allocation of resources. To solve this problem and achieve efficient and low-cost utilization of computing resources at the edge of LEO satellite networks, this study focuses on the optimal design of server placement strategies. Specifically, we aim to meet the service while avoiding resource wastage by carefully selecting a subset of satellites as server nodes. On this basis, this study deepens and expands the previous research results by innovatively abstracting the LEO satellite network into a 2D ring topology model, which is closer to the actual deployment scenarios and provides a solid theoretical foundation for the subsequent analyses. Furthermore, we extend and optimize the discrete resource allocation method under the constraint of Quality of Service(QoS). The method comprehensively considers multiple factors, such as user distribution, service demand, satellite orbit characteristics and resource cost, and iteratively searches for the optimal or near-optimal server placement scheme through algorithms."

    "abstract": "Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (pine wood nematode, PWN) is a major threat to global forest ecosystems and forestry economies, yet it remains difficult to accurately distinguish from the morphologically similar Bursaphelenchus mucronatus under microscopy. To address the limitations of traditional morphology-based diagnosis, which relies heavily on expert experience, and the high cost of molecular detection, this study proposes a “two-stage + dual-ROI” framework. In the first stage, YOLOv12 is employed to detect adult females and crop the tail and vulval flap regions. In the second stage, CoAtNet is applied to perform fine-grained classification on reconstructed images with fused features, enabling integration of complementary local information. Experimental results show that YOLOv12 achieved an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 in nematode body detection, maintaining overall stability despite challenges in small-object recognition. For classification, CoAtNet achieved an accuracy of $94.00 \\%$, a precision of $94.80 \\%$, a recall of $93.05 \\%$, an $\\mathbf{F 1}$-score of $93.86 \\%$, and an AUC of 0.96, demonstrating strong discriminative capability. Ablation studies further confirmed the essential role of object detection and dual-ROI complementarity. In summary, the proposed approach effectively combines morphological priors with deep feature representations, providing a feasible solution for rapid identification of PWN and supporting forestry quarantine."

Unlike most IDS models, this framework uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to choose the best features is employed for classification. This step makes sure that the best input is used. In addition, this hyperparameters optimization, includes adjusting critical parameters including learning rate, dropout rates, kernel size, and activation functions, to get the best possible detection accuracy. To improve transparency, this work uses a type of Explainable AI (XAI) called Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to figure out what the model said and highlight the most important features for finding attacks. The proposed CNN-based IDS do better than other machine learning (ML) models on two benchmark datasets, such as UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017. With improved accuracy, recall, and F1-score, the proposed optimized CNN framework is a reliable and scalable option for practical IoT security applications, according to experimental findings."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks has dramatically expanded the attack surface for cyber threats, necessitating intelligent and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS). This study investigates the performance and adversarial robustness of a Random Forest (RF) classifier in detecting botnet-based intrusions across diverse IoT telemetry domains. A balanced training dataset was utilized to develop an initial RF model, achieving a near-perfect out-of-bag error rate of 0.14%. Feature importance analysis revealed that packet ordering and connection-level metrics were the most predictive features. To improve generalization and reduce model complexity, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed which identified a three-feature subset that maintained high classification performance (Accuracy: 99.73%, Kappa: 0.9946). A defensive RF model trained on this minimal feature space exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity on internal and external test sets. However, a significant drop in precision across domains (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 2 \\%}$</tex>) indicated a high false positive rate, particularly when evaluated on datasets with benign-majority labels, revealing an aggressive bias in attack prediction. Adversarial robustness was evaluated using the HopSkipJump (HSJ) black-box attack. The RF classifier failed to detect any of the adversarial perturbed attack samples, resulting in 0% accuracy, precision, and recall. These findings expose a critical vulnerability in decision-tree-based IDS models when exposed to decision-boundary manipulation. In conclusion, while Random Forest classifiers demonstrate high baseline accuracy in detecting IoT-based intrusions, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial evasion. The study emphasizes the need for incorporating adversarial defenses such as robust training, input preprocessing and hybrid architectures in future IDS design to safeguard evolving 5G-enabled infrastructures. The findings advocate for a shift toward adversarially-aware machine learning pipelines in security-critical environments."

However, its adoption by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries like Indonesia remains under-researched. This study analyzes the intention of MSMEs to adopt blockchain technology in Jakarta, Indonesia by utilizing the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) model along with institutional factors. A quantitative survey in the form of questionnaire regarding these variables, consisting of 27 questions using a likert scale, involving 100 MSME owners and managers of various industries, shows that Top Management Support (β=0.716) and Competitive Pressure (β=0.155) are the most influential factors driving blockchain adoption. Relative Advantages and Regulation and Legislation have smaller but significant effects while Technological Readiness does not show significance. This suggests that for Jakarta's MSMEs, strategic leadership and market dynamics currently outweigh internal technological capabilities in the decision-making process. The model explains 99.2% of the variation in adoption intention highlighting the significance of leadership commitment, market-driven strategies, and regulatory clarity to drive blockchain adoption. By filling the research gap regarding blockchain adoption in MSMEs in developing countries, this study offers practical insights for MSME owners and policymakers to foster an ecosystem that encourages technological innovation in Indonesia."

Among the various extensions of the classical capacitated VRP, the Cumulative Vehicle Routing Problem (Cum-VRP) introduces cumulative constraints that substantially increase the problem’s complexity. Tackling such challenges necessitates advanced optimisation methods capable of producing high-quality solutions within practical computational times. Although heuristic techniques are frequently employed, they often become impractical for large-scale instances. In this study, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is enhanced through the incorporation of local search strategies and neighbourhood operators to address the Cum-VRP effectively. Comparative experiments against the Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) algorithm demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ABC approach, delivering improvements in solution quality, computational efficiency, and feasibility."

    "abstract": "Multi-Aspect Controllable Text Generation aims to control generated text attributes across multiple dimensions, such as “positive/negative” (sentiment), “technology/sports” (topic), and “detoxification” (content). To ease training sample acquisition, existing works usually reuse single-attribute annotated datasets, ignoring attribute correlations from mutual entanglement between attributes. Notably, imbalanced attribute co-occurrence in real data leads to stereotypical biases, which significantly harm the effectiveness of multi-aspect control. This paper proposes ACA-IMTG, a novel method adopting an adversarial causal augmentation strategy. It generates counterfactual feature vectors for attributes via an adversarial causal mechanism to alleviate imbalanced attribute co-occurrence during attribute representation learning, thereby enhancing low-frequency attribute combination representation. Experiments show ACAIMTG matches current state-of-the-art baselines in both imbalanced and balanced attribute co-occurrence scenarios, while effectively mitigating attribute imbalance-induced stereotypical biases and improving model generalization."

A series of experiments were conducted where key parameters, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, batch size, and optimizer, were systematically varied. The goal is to determine which configurations provide the best balance between prediction accuracy and training efficiency. The results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively approximate the resonant frequency based on physical antenna dimensions and material properties, while also highlighting configurations that either hinder or improve generalization. These findings contribute to the optimization of machine learning models for electromagnetic structure analysis."

Despite their critical role, human factors are often excluded from decision-support systems due to their perceived heterogeneity and subjectivity. We address this gap through a multi-case experimental study grounded in the hypothesis that human factors function as interdependent variables with measurable effects on project outcomes. A structured protocol was applied across five real-world B2B e-commerce projects, combining qualitative observations and evaluation metrics. Human factors were categorized into experience-based and behavioral dimensions, then tracked longitudinally and analyzed through co-occurrence mapping. Results validate the hypothesis, confirming that human factors form observable interaction patterns that influence project performance. These findings support the integration of human dimensions into formal project governance models and decision-support systems, offering a foundation for future interdisciplinary research bridging organizational behav-ior and systems engineering."

The review covers the main classes of interfaces: voice, switches and sip-and-puff, gaze and head movement tracking systems, myoelectric and neurointerfaces, and telerehabilitation. Particular attention is paid to the concept of shared control, which reduces cognitive load and increases the reliability of human- device interaction. An analysis of recent publications shows the active development of intelligent technologies, but reveals a lack of randomised clinical trials, limited reproducibility of results, and a shortage of assistive devices focused on the upper limbs. Additionally, barriers to implementation are highlighted: insufficient digital literacy of users, fatigue when using interfaces, and a high probability of abandoning assistive technologies in the absence of support service. Based on the identified gaps in the literature, a task is formulated to develop a concept for a multimodal interface that combines voice input with alternative control channels."

To address this, we propose GAIN: a GATv2-based Adaptive Framework for Innovative Topic Mining in Patent Knowledge Graphs. GAIN tackles challenges such as high computational complexity in graph robustness calculations, the limitations of traditional centrality measures in heterogeneous graphs, and inadequate semantic differentiation in existing graph neural networks (GNNs). The framework integrates GATv2 with graph robustness metrics, incorporates a dynamic hop mechanism and DiGRAF adaptive activation function to improve node embedding, and uses changes in graph robustness as a supervisory signal for ranking-based optimization. Experimental results on four real-world patent knowledge graphs (AD-KG, ML-KG, CS-KG, AI-KG) show that GAIN outperforms existing methods in Top- 5% node identification accuracy, achieving up to 96.65%, while also demonstrating scalability and inductive capability. GAIN provides an efficient, accurate, and interpretable solution for key node identification in complex heterogeneous graphs."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for wireless communication and the growing scarcity of spectral resources, Free-Space Optical (FSO) communication has attracted significant attention as a solution offering high bandwidth and low latency. However, FSO systems are susceptible to atmospheric conditions and other interfering factors, which lead to fluctuations in signal quality and transmission distance. To achieve reliable optical communication, atmospheric turbulence suppression techniques have become crucial.This paper aims to investigate an active control method for mitigating atmospheric turbulence based on laser communication transmitters to optimize the performance of FSO systems. We analyze the characteristics of the atmospheric transmission channel and the light intensity attenuation model to establish a system framework. Furthermore, an active control approach utilizing the laser transmitter is proposed to suppress atmospheric turbulence. This method employs a feedback mechanism from a bidirectional transceiver system to adjust the transmit power in real-time, adapting to varying channel conditions and transmission distances.Experimental results demonstrate that under conditions of weak atmospheric turbulence, the scintillation index can effectively reflect the intensity of turbulence. After activating the active control of the laser transmitter, the scintillation index decreased from 0.067 to 0.033, and the system’s bit error rate (BER) was reduced by two orders of magnitude. Extensive tests ultimately verified that the active control method of the laser transmitter can effectively mitigate atmospheric turbulence by suppressing the fluctuation of optical power caused by turbulence during atmospheric propagation. Consequently, it maximizes signal quality and transmission range, enabling the system to cope with changes in atmospheric conditions and variations in communication distance. This approach significantly enhances the stability and reliability of the communication system."

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate diagnosis of retinal diseases from Optical Coherence Tomography images is crucial for preventing irreversible vision loss, yet automated classification is challenged by low image resolution and significant class imbalance in public datasets such as OCTMNIST. While Vision Transformers offer a powerful alternative to traditional models, their application to these specific challenges, particularly when enhanced with targeted attention mechanisms, remains underexplored. This research addresses this gap by developing and validating a robust classification model that enhances ViT-tiny architecture with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our methodology integrates CBAM to refine feature embeddings, which are then optimized using a full fine-tuning strategy, weighted cross-entropy loss to counteract class imbalance, and on-the-fly data augmentation. The proposed CBAM-ViT model established a new state-of-the-art performance on the OCTMNIST test set, achieving an accuracy of 86.40%, a macro F1-score of 85.97%, and a mean Area Under the ROC Curve (mAUC) of 0.9760, surpassing both a baseline ViT and previously published benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that integrating a CBAM attention mechanism into a fully fine-tuned ViT provides a highly effective strategy for classifying low-resolution, imbalanced medical images, establishing a new, robust performance benchmark and highlighting the value of hybrid attention architectures for challenging diagnostic tasks."

    "abstract": "Differential transmission lines, commonly used in high-speed data interfaces such as USB and low-voltage differential signaling, are susceptible to electromagnetic interference. This includes ultra-wideband and narrow-band interferences, which can disrupt data transmission. A technique called modal reservation is used to address this issue. It involves placing a redundant transmission line next to the primary one, creating strong electromagnetic coupling between them and effectively filtering out ultra-wideband and narrow-band interferences. This significantly increases the resistance of data transmission to these disturbances. However, articles on devices using differential transmission lines or differential transmission lines with modal reservation have not yet reported measurements of their performance after failure. Therefore, this paper presents pre- and post-failure measurements of a single- modal reservation differential transmission lines device. Electrodynamic simulations in the frequency domain show that the passband shift after failure does not exceed 2%. In the time domain, ultra-wideband and narrow-band interference changes after failure is less than 1.1%. Signal integrity analysis shows that signal-noise ratio increases from 19.234 under no-fault conditions to 22.153 under short-circuit conditions, indicating increased immunity to interference. Quasi-static simulations validate these findings, revealing discrepancies of no more than 7% in time-domain measurements and less than 3% in frequency-domain measurements. These results indicate that ultra-wideband and narrow-band interferences do not affect the operation of differential transmission lines -based systems, making them highly resistant to these disturbances."

By combining depth cues directly into the offset features, our approach strengthens geometric reasoning and leads to improved object association in cases of occlusions and reappearances. On the KITTI multi-object tracking and segmentation dataset, our method reduces identity switching by 21.11% compared to PointTrack baseline, showing increased robustness of tractlet association in challenging scenes.

These effects introduce Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which degrade signal integrity. To mitigate these impairments, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) combined with Zero Forcing (ZF) equalization is employed at the receiver. System performance is evaluated using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation, with Bit Error Rate (BER) as the performance metric. At an AB/No of 10 dB, ZF equalization consistently reduces BER across various speeds: at 5 m/s from 0.1042 to 0.0545 (47.75% improvement), at 25 m/s from 0.1057 to 0.0548 (48.11%), and at 55 m/s from 0.1084 to 0.0544 (48.79%).

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the effects that modern Medium Voltage (MV) adjustable speed drives (ASDs) have on the large motors they control. Most published technical literature on ASDs describe the issues associated with Low Voltage (LV) ASDs, their voltage waveforms and how they affect small or medium sized motors. This information is not accurate for MV ASDs applied to large motors. The larger horsepower motors utilized on MV ASDs are designed differently (insulation systems, windings, air gaps and bearings) than smaller LV motors, which changes how they react to the PWM waveforms. Specific topics addressed include voltage waveform effects on motor insulation, common mode bearing currents, partial discharge, and harmonic heating of the motor. This paper presents the differences of MV PWM ASDs compared to LV ASDs with respect to output voltage characteristics such as dv/dt, step voltage, and PWM switching frequency. MV ASDs require different guidelines to prevent damage to motors than their LV counterparts. The effect of these factors on motor heating, peak terminal voltage, output filter requirement and bearing currents are discussed. Data from technical papers, standards, and test data are referenced. The goal of the paper is to reduce the confusion on the application of MV ASDs."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of radiomic features extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) perfusion imaging, both alone and in combination with clinical variables, for mortality prediction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Logistic regression and random forest models were trained with class weighting and stratified cross-validation across the three main coronary territories: left anterior descending, right coronary, and left circumflex arteries. Models based solely on radiomic features achieved moderate predictive performance, with AUC values between 0.64 and 0.69. When clinical variables such as leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), BNP, infarct location, and ejection fraction were included, model performance improved significantly, reaching AUCs between 0.83 and 0.85. These findings demonstrate that integrating radiomic and clinical information enhances predictive accuracy and supports the use of CMR radiomics as a complementary tool for non-invasive prognosis assessment in CAD. Future multicenter studies and deep learning approaches are warranted to validate and generalize these results."

Upon receiving the rising edge of a signal, a ripple signal with multiple transitions is generated and sampled over multiple consecutive clock cycles using a D flip-flop (DFF) bank. Each cycle captures an independent snapshot of the ripple's propagation through a tapped delay line (TDL), and the timing is derived from the transition edge positions within each snapshot."

Currently, Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)-based algorithms used for mobile robot path planning still face issues such as high randomness in the search space, slow convergence, and resulting curvy paths. To address these problems, this paper proposes an improved Bidirectional Artificial Potential Field-RRT* (IBi-APF-RRT*) path planning algorithm. In node expansion, the method first combines random tree expansion with a goal-biasing strategy to eliminate the randomness of the tree and rapidly direct the search toward the goal. Additionally, based on bidirectional exploration, an optimized artificial potential field (APF) method is employed to guide the tree expansion toward the goal region while avoiding obstacles. Experimental results show that the proposed IBi-APF-RRT* algorithm outperforms several popular RRT* variants in terms of both path length and runtime. Compared to RRT*, APF-RRT*, Bi-RRT*, and Bias-RRT*, the average path length is reduced by 15.22%, 5.46%, 17.17%, and 11.25%, respectively, and the average runtime is reduced by 95.39%, 94.20%, 52.47%, and 51.01%, respectively, demonstrating the efficiency and adaptability of the improved algorithm."

    "abstract": "The subject of the study is to analyze the impact of reverberation, compression and equalization methods on the accuracy of speaker speech detection. In recent years, the significance of audio preprocessing has grown considerably due to its crucial role in tasks such as data compression, filtering, and noise reduction. With the increasing demand for audio information classification, evaluating and comparing different preprocessing techniques has become essential to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the resulting solutions. This study focuses on examining how various audio preprocessing methods affect the accuracy of speaker speech detection, which is critical for subsequent neural network training. Particular emphasis is placed on methods of transforming audio signals into features, specifically using low-frequency cepstral coefficients. To achieve this objective, the study involved analyzing signal-to-feature transformation techniques and mathematical models used for audio sequence analysis based on the extracted features. A generalized real-time speaker speech translation model was developed, and an experiment was designed according to the selected audio preprocessing stages. The experiment was simulated by training and testing a convolutional neural network. The following methods were used: mel-frequency cepstral analysis, spectral analysis, mathematical methods of artificial intelligence. The following results have been obtained: depending on the chosen methods of pre-processing voice information and different ways of converting the signal into features, 86% accuracy of speaker’s language detection was achieved. The practical value of this work lies in expanding the range of audio files that can be used for training neural networks, as well as enabling translation of the resulting text into a selected language, including constructed or artificial languages. This study explored how different audio preprocessing techniques influence the accuracy of detecting a speaker’s speech, which is vital for subsequent neural network training involving various signal-to-feature transformation methods. The findings indicate that, in cases where audio recordings contain echoes, applying equalization can help reduce the echo effect."

Traditional control methods, such as traps and rodenticides, are often ineffective on a large scale and have negative environmental impacts. This study developed a real-time rat detection system based on deep learning using the YOLOv11 algorithm, implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 for early monitoring in rice storage warehouses. A total of 410 rat images were collected and processed through Roboflow for segmentation, then divided into training (328), validation (41), and testing (41) datasets. The YOLOv11 model was trained for 500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.002, batch size of 4, and the AdamW optimizer. To prevent overfitting, early stopping was applied with a threshold of 100 epochs without performance improvement. Training results showed the model achieved a precision of 0.955, recall of 0.86, mAP@0.50 of 0.87, and mAP@0.50–0.95 of 0.39. The prototype system, consisting of a Raspberry Pi 5, webcam, and buzzer, was capable of real-time rat detection and provided audible alerts. This research demonstrates that integrating YOLOv11 with low-power computing devices offers an effective, sustainable, and applicable solution for rodent pest detection in agricultural storage environments."

A quantitative approach was used, with data collected from 392 respondents through structured questionnaires. The analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to test the relationships among the constructs. The findings reveal that optimism and innovativeness have a positive and significant effect on PU and PEOU, while discomfort and insecurity show negative impacts. Furthermore, both PU and PEOU significantly influence ITU. Model accuracy is supported by the R Square values, with PU showing the strongest explanatory power, R Square value 0.642, followed by R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of PEOU, a value 0.577, and R Square of ITU, a value 0.472, indicating that these key constructs are well-accounted for by the proposed psychological predictors.

However, the acquisition of annotated SAR image samples is challenging due to the high labor costs and the stochastic nature of the coherent imaging mechanism. To address this issue, we propose SarDDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for SAR image generation. In the proposed SarDDPM, to align with the multiplicative degradation pattern, the input SAR image is first logarithmically transformed, and then the forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes are defined on this transformed data. In addition, SarDDPM is a conditional diffusion model, where the class labels of SAR images are used as classifier-free guidance for conditional generation. Experimental results on the TerraSAR-X and Orchard dataset demonstrate that SarDDPM outperforms generative adversarial network (GANs)-based baselines in terms of image quality and diversity. Furthermore, augmenting the training set with the samples generated by SarDDPM yields improvement in SAR image classification accuracy."

Unlike traditional forward or optimization-based formulations, the framework integrates analytical kinematics with neural fields to ensure both physical consistency and adaptive motion generation. The method estimates the Jacobian matrix as a physically constrained neural field, merging analytical structure with data-driven learning to achieve robust and interpretable behavior without relying on iterative numerical solvers. Theoretical analysis, simulations, and physical experiments demonstrate the framework's accuracy, stability, and adaptability across different parallel mechanisms."

Using basic Lyapunov’s stability theory and the notion of extended K∞ functions, we developed a method for determining and enforcing the global asymptotic stability of the single fixed point of the resulting closed-loop (CL) scheme. In contrast with traditional quaternion-based methods, the proposed generalized axis–angle approach enables greater flexibility in the design of the control law, which is of great utility when employed in combination with a switching scheme whose transition state depends on the angular velocity of the controlled rotational system. Through simulation and real-time experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Battery energy storage systems enhance operational flexibility by mitigating imbalance penalties and enabling energy arbitrage. However, accurate battery sizing is challenging due to its strong coupling with operational strategies, making it a multi-scale optimization problem. Additionally, uncertainty in renewable generation and market prices increases the computational complexity, as is typically the case for stochastic programming approaches. This paper proposes a computationally efficient method for optimal battery sizing for renewable producers participating in real-time markets. We leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a stochastic sequential decision-making framework and extend it to co-optimize the battery capacity with the bidding strategy. Unlike existing bi-level optimization approaches, our method integrates battery sizing directly into the bidding policy training process. This one-shot optimization framework improves computational efficiency by eliminating the need for repeated RL trainings across candidate battery capacities. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively optimizes battery investment and operational performance over a target year."

Firstly, data preprocessing and feature selection are employed to significantly enhance the discriminative capability of features. Then, M1DCNN is utilized to extract multi-scale information, overcoming the limitations of traditional one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) in handling complex features. Meanwhile, the integration of HWSCCE enables dynamic adjustment of sample weights, effectively mitigating the issue of class imbalance. The effectiveness of combining M1DCNN with HWSCCE is validated through ablation and comparative experiments. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the combined model of M1DCNN and HWSCCE achieves an mF1 of 93.07%, representing a 3.21% improvement over the baseline 1DCNN model, indicating a significant performance enhancement. In comparative experiments, the proposed model outperforms other benchmark algorithms on the collected dataset. Furthermore, generalization tests on different datasets constructed based on the IEC TC 10 dataset show that the model maintains consistently high performance, with mP, mR, and mF1 mostly exceeding 86%. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy and reliability of transformer fault diagnosis, exhibits strong generalization capability, and provides robust support for the safe and stable operation of power systems."

Two detectors consisting of 12 LYSO slabs of 0.96 × 56 × 10 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> in size, with black-painted on the front and two end faces were constructed. The detectors were single-ended read out by a 4 × 16 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array with a row and column summimg circuit. The squared COG method was used to obtain the position in the monolithic direction (y), and inverse standard deviation method was used to obtain the DOI information. First, an ultra-micro hot-rod phantom with rods diameter of 0.75,1.0,1.35,1.7,2.0, and 2.4 mm was simulated on a full-ring small animal PET scanner consisting of 20 semi-monolithic detectors using the GATE software. Second, a prototype small animal PET scanner consisting of two semi-monolithic detectors and a rotation platform were constructed. Na-22 point source with a diameter of 0.3 mm placed at the center and a radial offset of 5 mm was measured. For each position, the point source was measured at 10 angles with an interval of 18 degree. The images were reconstructed by using an ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm with PSF modeling. Rods with a diameter of 0.75 mm were clearly resolved form the image of the ultra-micro hot-rod phantom using the simulated data. A spatial resolution of better than 0.65 mm was obtained on the prototype PET scanner using measured data."

LVAD implants are currently powered through a percutaneous cable that is often the cause of critical infections known as driveline infections (DLI) that require device explantation. The innovative WPT technology to power LVAD systems is a particularly attractive solution to overcome the criticality related to DLI and to improve patient comfort.

    "abstract": "Accurately determining surgical strategies, such as complete or partial repairs, is essential for effective treatment planning in rotator cuff injuries. This study proposes a novel two-stage framework leveraging multi-view cross attention to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from coronal and sagittal views, addressing the challenges posed by limited datasets. In Stage 1, segmentation of six clinically relevant regions from each view was performed for feature extraction. In Stage 2, segmentation results were combined with original MRI images using cross-view transformers, enabling the extraction of interdependencies between segmented and original data. To further enhance prediction accuracy, multi-head cross attention was employed to merge features from both views, capturing their spatial and anatomical relationships. The proposed framework achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 in predicting surgical repair types, effectively distinguishing between complete and partial repairs. While segmentation performance in Stage 1 showed variability (Intersection over Union, IoU: 0.45–0.83) due to the limited dataset size (211 samples), the incorporation of multi-view cross attention significantly enhanced prediction accuracy by leveraging complementary information from both sagittal and coronal views. This demonstrates the framework’s capability to mitigate the challenges of limited data in segmentation tasks by improving overall classification performance."

To effectively mitigate these challenges, this study proposes a flexible prescribed performance-based fault-tolerant control framework specifically designed for HVs experiencing multiple actuator faults. First, a dual-component fault-tolerant control strategy is introduced, combining robustness enhancement with active control compensation to address a broad spectrum of potential fault modes, thereby ensuring system reliability in complex fault scenarios. Second, an innovative flexible PPC scheme is developed to proactively avoid the control singularity problems commonly encountered in traditional PPC approaches under actuator failures. Moreover, the proposed control architecture is streamlined to eliminate the need for external disturbance observers or neural network approximations, significantly improving its practical feasibility. Finally, comprehensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and performance superiority of the proposed control methodology."

    "abstract": "In Open-Set Single Domain Generalization (OS-SDG), one only has access to a single labeled source domain for training. It assumes that the learned model generalizes well to target samples belonging to the source label space whilst classifies target samples outside the source label space into a single “unknown” class. The current method synthesizes new samples that are semantically unrelated to known classes to simulate target unknown classes. This ignores that unknown classes actually may semantically correlated to known classes, making it difficult to discriminate samples at the margins of class decision boundaries as “unknown”. In this work, we introduce a Class-Aware Diversified Augmentation (CADA) method to overcome this problem. Our key idea is to synthesize explicitly new multiple unknown target classes with diversified semantic and learn the inherent correlation among the known and unknown classes, so to both increase the coverage of multiple target unknown classes and to optimize class margin separation. CADA is optimized by enhanced diversity maximization and class-aware minimization. The former synthesizes more novel classes by considering both semantic relationships to known classes and domain shift between the source and target domains. The latter employs class-agnostic clustering with synthesized samples to simulate class correlations among target classes, maximizing class margin separation. Theoretical analysis and experiments on five benchmarks show the efficacy of our CADA."

    "abstract": "Many applications in nuclear science and medical imaging use scintillators to convert high-energy photons or particles into multiple photons that can be detected with silicon light detectors. For applications where the time of interaction matters, such as time-of-flight (ToF) positron emission tomography and ToF computed tomography, we need to timestamp the first photon detected. Unfortunately, single-photon detectors are subject to dark counts, which adds uncertainty to the measured timestamps. To better evaluate the time of interaction, we can use an estimator constructed on the first few timestamps. Thus, multiple time-to-digital converters (TDC) are required in the detector for the estimator to operate. Our team at the Universit'e de Sherbrooke is working on a 5 mm × 5 mm photon-to-digital converter (PDC). The detector is composed of 4096 single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) 3D integrated with a TSMC 65 nm ASIC composed of an array of 4096 quenching circuits and 512 TDCs. As a stepping stone to the full-size PDC, we developed a test chip that includes 32 SPADs, 32 quenching circuits (QC), and 16 TDCs. The TDC is a 43 μm × 35 μm ring oscillator-based cascaded Vernier TDC with 2 stages. The TDC was characterised in multiple configurations: standalone, in group of 8, and in group of 16 running at the same time. Only a difference in the integral nonlinearity was observed at the target resolution of 10 ps. At this target resolution, we measured a precision of 4.1 ps rms, an average conversion time of 8.6 ns, and a power consumption of 28.6 μW at 1 Mcps. A test campaign will be done in Q3 2025 to evaluate the stability of the device and obtain a single photon timing resolution."

Accurately recovering the first interaction position of these events is challenging but crucial, as it allows correct line-of-response identification and reduces the degradation of image quality caused by ICS. Most ICS recovery studies have focused on pixelated detectors and relied primarily on Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we apply, for the first time, ICS recovery to experimental data from semi-monolithic detectors, using both analytical and deep-learning based approaches. Measurements were performed using collimated irradiation of 8 - and 16 -slab arrays, read out with a 64 -channel SiPM array and TOFPET2 ASIC together with a row-column channel reduction. We demonstrate that ICS affects both positioning and timing performance, and propose a time-walk correction improving time resolution by about 10 %. The deep learning approach yielded the highest prediction accuracy for first interactions, reaching <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$87.7 \\pm 4.3 \\%$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$73.3 \\pm 4.0 \\%$</tex> for the 8 - and 16 -slab detectors, respectively.

The proposed method targets prompt gamma-rays with an energy of 4.4 MeV, emitted by nuclear reactions between incident protons and atomic nuclei in the body. These gamma-rays exhibit spatial distributions closely aligned with the proton dose profile, making them suitable for beam range verification. To efficiently detect 4.4 MeV gamma-rays in high background environments, only the scatterer is placed near the subject, and the absorber is positioned behind a shield that blocks direct radiation from the subject. The method employs not only conventional two-hit coincidence events but also multiple Compton scattering events, in which gamma-rays undergo sequential interactions- first in the scatterer and then multiple times within the absorber. In this method, the position where the gamma-ray first interacts is limited to the scatterer, the order of interactions can be limited, allowing for more accurate imaging with high efficiency using the information of interaction positions and energy depositions. Monte Carlo simulations with a virtual detector system implemented in Geant4 confirmed that the feasibility of imaging 4.4 MeV gammarays using the proposed method."

In the proposed RSMA-based HSTRN, a satellite communicates with multiple users via terrestrial relays in the presence of an eavesdropper. In order to improve the secrecy performance, we propose two relay selection schemes, namely, partial relay selection (PRS) and two-stage relay selection (TSRS). We derive exact closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP), intercept probability (IP), and effective secrecy throughput (EST) for the PRS and TSRS schemes. To further enhance the secrecy performance of proposed system, the relay selection schemes are extended to jammer-assisted HSTRN, and we propose the jammer aided PRS (JPRS) and jammer aided TSRS (JTSRS) schemes. The exact closed-form OP, IP, and EST expressions for the JPRS and JTSRS schemes are also obtained. Numerical results show that in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the TSRS scheme outperforms the PRS scheme in terms of EST, while in the low SNR region, the result is opposite. Additionally, in the high SNR region, the secrecy performance of jammer-aided relay selection schemes, i.e., JPRS and JTSRS schemes, outperform relay selection schemes without the support of a jammer, i.e., PRS and TSRS schemes. Moreover, it shows that the RSMA-based HSTRN achieves better secrecy performance than the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based HSTRN in high SNR region."

We first pretrain a spectral classifier using a labeled synthetic dataset and subsequently leverage unlabeled target data to align the learned feature representations between the source and target domains. The motivation behind this approach is twofold: first, reducing the domain shift minimizes the performance drop when applying the model to target data; and second, learning domain-invariant latent representations helps avoid overfitting to features present only in the source domain. We adopt a proof-of-concept approach using GADRAS as our source domain and Geant4 as our target domain, with the Geant4 labels intentionally masked. We compare a range of different unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, finding that adversarial discriminative domain adaptation yields the most substantial improvement in test performance across all architectures considered (CNN, MLP, Transformer). The statistical significance of these conclusions is confirmed using a series of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Furthermore, we find that unsupervised domain adaptation reduces the maximum mean discrepancy between the sourceand target-domain features, demonstrating improved feature alignment. Overall, our results highlight the potential for unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to adapt a radioisotope classifier trained on synthetic data for use in real-world settings where data is abundant but labels are unavailable."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the feasibility of applying a multi-material decomposition (MMD) algorithm to dual-energy cone-beam computed tomography (DE-CBCT) for enhancing image quality in linear accelerator-based radiotherapy. The MMD algorithm was compared with the conventional threematerial decomposition method commonly used in CBCT. Low- and high-energy CBCT scans were acquired using a digital phantom in simulation and a cheese phantom on a linear accelerator. The MMD algorithm decomposed the images into multiple basis material maps, which were subsequently recombined using energy-dependent linear attenuation coefficients to generate virtual monoenergetic (VM) images at specified energies. Image quality and decomposition performance were evaluated using volume fraction accuracy (VFA), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The MMD method improved the average VFA by 14.3% in the digital phantom and 5.2% in the cheese phantom compared to the conventional method. The average SSIM values of the VM images at five energy levels were 0.62 and 0.97 for the conventional and MMD methods, respectively. The most significant CNR enhancement was observed at 20 keV, with increases of 8.6% and 4.3% compared to the 80 kVp and 140 kVp images, respectively. These results demonstrate that the MMD algorithm enhances material decomposition accuracy and improves the quality of VM images relative to the conventional method. The VM images and basis material maps obtained through this method may provide valuable information for improving the accuracy of patient setup."

In high gamma-ray environments where neutron signatures need to be measured, a fast scintillator with reduced gamma-sensitivity is needed. We propose a new method that makes use of the different rates of energy deposition of recoil protons compared to recoil electrons to reduce gamma count rates. In this study, 1 mm thick stilbene and organic glass scintillators were compared to 6 mm cubes to observe the impact of electron leakage on PSD performance and gamma detection. There was a significant change to the Cs-137 gamma-spectrum of these detectors, due to recoilelectron escape in the thinner samples. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant decrease in pulse-shape discrimination performance between the two pairs of scintillators. The results demonstrate the use of thin scintillators for neutron detection in high-gamma ray environments."

Accurate segmentation is essential for density analysis and treatment planning. We propose a pipeline that enhances DBT segmentation using simulated data and voxel-level refinement via machine learning. DBT images are generated from MC-GPU simulations of the VICTRE phantom and reconstructed into volumes. Segmentation labels are created by assigning mean linear attenuation coefficients for air, fat, and dense tissues based on phantom materials. A 3D UNet is trained on image-label pairs to produce coarse segmentation results. For refinement, we adopt a PointRend-inspired MLP strategy. Voxels with high uncertainty, estimated from softmax outputs, are selected. Their features—UNet high-resolution features, softmax probabilities, and spatial coordinates—are used to train an MLP to refine predictions. To ensure stability, we preserve the coarse prediction when the MLP output has low confidence. We also experiment with correcting only fat-dense boundaries to avoid unnecessary changes in well-classified regions. To enhance learning, the MLP incorporates gating, residual blending, and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, enabling the model to focus on informative features. A DenseCRF-based post-processing step is applied to enforce spatial consistency and structural smoothness. Experiments show that this pipeline effectively reduces common misclassifications—particularly air predictions near fat-dense boundaries—and improves segmentation accuracy. Our work establishes a simulation-to-segmentation framework with voxel-level correction, informed feature design, and post-refinement, with potential applicability to clinical DBT and adaptive radiotherapy."

The encoder learns low-dimensional embeddings for each modality, which are then merged and decoded into a fused image. The model is trained using a composite loss function combining reconstruction error (MSE), cosine similarity between modality-specific embeddings, and a differentiable approximation of mutual information via Parzen window estimation. The method is validated on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database in the context of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Classification experiments using a convolutional neural network show that fused images outperform individual modalities, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.87 and AUC of 0.88. To evaluate explainability, we perform an occlusion test over 116 anatomical regions, revealing that performance drops most when masking areas known to be associated with cognitive decline. Furthermore, we compute region-to-region embedding distances across MRI-PET, PET-MRI, and fused-fused scenarios, confirming that our model preserves fine-grained structural-functional associations. These results confirm the method's diagnostic value and biological interpretability."

However, a challenge arises in ensuring that users can distinguish the common message from the remaining non-decoded private messages without considering a separate SIC constraint per user. This imperfection cancellation leads to residual interference from the common stream that remains in the received signal. This work investigates the maximization of the weighted sum-rate (WSR) in single-layer RSMA multiple input single output (MISO) downlink network by proposing explicit SIC constraints. In particular, we suggest an approach that initially addresses the critical problem of allocating power and precoding vectors for streams using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and then determines the user-specific allocations within the common rate to meet the criteria of users' minimum rate by solving a linear programming problem. Simulation results exhibit the supremacy of the proposed DRL framework over SDMA and other DRL approaches in terms of spectral efficiency leading to an improvement of approximately 30% of WSR in several scenarios."

We are developing a cost-efficient TB-PET system utilizing plastic scintillators [2,3]. This study discusses the current development status, including tests of individual detectors with SiPMs and new simulation results based on the finalized design. During the experimental phase, we tested individual detector units using SiPMs connected to the axial ends of plastic scintillator strips with a collimated beam of 511 keV photons from a Na-22 isotope source. We characterized the detector performance using two types of SiPMs, from Hamamatsu and Onsemi. Based on these characterization results, we evaluated performance across different scintillator lengths and selected two lengths for use in the final design of the total-body Jagiellonian PET (TB-J-PET). With these selected lengths (33 cm and 60 cm), the TB-J-PET geometry was redesigned, and simulations were conducted using GATE [4] to evaluate system sensitivity, scatter fraction, and spatial resolution. TB-J-PET will be built using the latest generation of J-PET technology, which is presented and discussed in this study. The first generation of the J-PET scanner was built using 192 plastic scintillator strips, each 50 cm long, and read out by PMTs [5,6].

    "abstract": "With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta’s Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta’s Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors."

    "abstract": "Illegal diversion of shielded contraband like explosives, chemical weapons, and drugs in cargo can be non-destructively detected by observing the gammas rays produced during active neutron interrogation. The active gamma background produced during the neutron irradiation of such setups has signatures that interfere with the gammas produced by contraband, making rapid detection a challenge. The gamma spectra produced in neutron interrogation environments are time-dependent, and this time-dependence can be observed especially when using a pulsed neutron source. Gating the gamma spectra over time can help reject background gammas and improve the signal-noise-ratio of contraband gammas. In this work, we use a pulsed Sodern Genie <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$16 \\mathrm{D}-\\mathrm{T}$</tex> generator and a large 6 x 6 array of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3^{\\prime \\prime} \\times 8^{\\prime \\prime} \\text{NaI}(\\text{Tl})$</tex> detectors to exploit the time-dependence of the neutron-induced gammas in our cargo inspection setup, for identification of optimized timing windows and improve the detection of contraband gammas like the nitrogen 10.8 MeV and chlorine 6.1 MeV signals.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the need for reliable real-time communication and secure data sharing has become increasingly critical. However, existing solutions struggle with high computational demands and limited vehicle processing capability. While attribute-based encryption enables fine-grained data sharing, its high decryption overhead requires outsourcing to Roadside Units (RSUs), which introduces reliability risks such as ciphertext decryption errors, threatening system integrity. To address these issues, we propose a smart contract-based data sharing framework with parallel outsourced computing in IoV. Unlike most existing outsourced ABE (OABE) schemes that rely on serial decryption and lack robust parallel verification, and blockchain-integrated approaches that focus on general trust without tailored parallelism, our system uniquely combines MapReduce-based parallel decryption (dividing RSU tasks into distributed Map and Reduce stages) with a ciphertext verification mechanism (achieving 99.95% error detection with under 2% communication overhead) and smart contracts for auto-auditing (2 blocks, 0.003 ETH cost, preventing 98.7% malicious behaviors). Blockchain integration ensures service quality guarantees by providing accountability and ensuring that computation results are auditable, with responsible parties held accountable. Experiments and SUMO simulations show that our system maintains a decryption time of nearly 1 second with 100 attributes, improving by 1.6 seconds over serial decryption, while reducing transformation key generation complexity from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>) to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(1).

    "abstract": "To overcome the loss of spatial resolution in Flat-Panel Detector (FPD) cone-beam CT (CBCT) due to light spread in the scintillator, we propose to use laser ablation in conjunction with Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to pixelate the scintillator film and coat the pixelation grooves with reflective/absorptive materials. Our earlier studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in 700 µm-thick CsI: Tl suitable for body imaging. By enacting barriers to lateral light spread, we were able to improve the limiting spatial resolution compared to CsI:Tl of the same thickness by ~ 20% (frequency at 10% modulation, f<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</inf>=4.7 lp/mm). We report on ongoing modeling and experimental work to improve detection efficiency and spatial resolution of this technology by new ablation and ALD processes to (i) reduce grove thickness (to minimize loss of CsI:Tl volume), and (ii) enhance the reflectivity of inter-pixel coatings (to mitigate absorptive light loss.) Cascaded system analysis assuming a 100 µm CMOS photodiode readout array and a 20 cm object indicates 2x fold improvement in high-frequency (5 lp/mm) Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) using the new film compared to the current unpixelated CsI:Tl. The pixelated scintillator will enhance visualization of features at the ~ 150 µm scale - for example, lung microvasculature, breast microcalcifications, complex endovascular devices, and bone trabeculae - especially in large body sites. Our experimental validation using a CBCT test bench focuses on trabecular bone to support improved imaging of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis."

We first implement a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system, followed by the fusion of LiDAR and image data to generate a local BEV perception image of the UGV. This approach mitigates the significant viewpoint discrepancy between ground-view images and satellite map. The BEV image and satellite map are then projected into the road similarity space, where normalized cross correlation (NCC) is computed to assess the matching score. Finally, a particle filter is employed to estimate the probability distribution of the vehicle’s pose. By comparing with GNSS ground truth, our localization system demonstrated stability without divergence over a long-distance test of $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ k m}$, achieving an average lateral error of only 0.89 meters and an average planar Euclidean error of 3.41 meters. These results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-theart methods in the field.

This paper presents a microgrid model with IEC-type configuration developed in ETAP software, including synchronous machine-based sources, wind turbines, and realistic relay settings. Initial analysis demonstrated that conventional inverse time-current characteristics and nonstandard tripping curves could not ensure both sensitivity and selectivity, leading to miscoordination when transformer inrush currents were present. To address these limitations, a set of enhancements was introduced, including blocking functions against transformer inrush currents, the transition to definitetime characteristics, and the integration of voltage-supervised directional overcurrent protection. Autonomous automatic circuit reclosers were employed to avoid dependence on centralized communication-based schemes. Simulation results confirmed that the proposed approach improves protection reliability under grid-connected, islanded, and parallel modes of operation, while maintaining robust performance across a wide range of fault scenarios.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel nonlinear integral sliding mode observer (NNI-SMO)-based model-free current predictive control method for dual three-phase Permanent magnet synchronous motor (DT-PMSM). The NNI-SMO is designed based on Lyapunov stability theory to ensure the stability of the proposed method. In addition, this paper analyzes and compares the NNI-SMO method with conventional deadbeat predictive current control and standard ISMO methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed NNI-SMO effectively eliminates high-frequency harmonic disturbances without relying on inverter nonlinearity information. Moreover, the NNI-SMO significantly reduces torque ripple and mitigates current distortion caused by inverter nonlinearity and system disturbances. Finally, simulation results validate the robustness of the proposed method, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing torque ripple and suppressing harmonic disturbances."

This paper presents a hybrid named entity recognition framework adapted for text analysis in this area. The algorithm starts with two rule-based preprocessing steps — alphabet standardization (Cyrillic → Latin) and dialect normalization — that mitigate orthographic variability and regional lexical drift. In addition, Bidirectional LSTM coupled with convolutional neural networks and a conditional random fields layer were used as neural network technologies for the named entity recognition language model. The system is trained on a curated, manually annotated corpus of Uzbek government documents that covers five main entity types: date/ time, organization, location, person, and money. It is worth noting that the sentences in the corpus are marked up using the BIOES scheme, which provides comprehensive marking of the entire text. Experiments show that each preprocessing component provides measurable performance improvements and that the hybrid architecture outperforms the baseline Transformers."

It is suggested to modify the controllers obtained by classical tuning methods to a modular and symmetrical optimum in order to achieve changes in the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the transient behavior of the system. As a result of computer simulation, asymptotic Bode magnitude plot with a logarithmic scale were obtained for the proposed variations of the controller synthesis, and the shapes of transients were in the form of a trapezoid for the work program. The experiment demonstrated that fractional-order controllers significantly affect the speed and steady-state errors of the control system, which directly influences the settling time. When a derivative term is used in the control law and the system is set to a symmetrical optimum, the overshoot decreases while the transient time decreases. However, the experiment also demonstrated the limitations of using fractional-degree controllers, as self-oscillation occurs in the output variable at a certain point."

The processing of the data focuses on administrative boundaries and the transportation infrastructures in West Jakarta. Data processing, spatial visualization, K-means clustering to cluster the district based on the population density and stop points of the transportation services. Analysis shows that the population distribution is not evenly distributed, with districts like Petamburan, Tambora, and Taman Sari showing high density, while others are less populated. Stop points data also shows that there are districts with an imbalance ratio of population density and the stop points. K-means Clustering, with Silhouette Score of 0.336 and an elbow point at K= 3 determined by the Elbow Method is used for the clustering process. Clustering results show districts with inadequate transportation services; this result could help in optimizing public transportation by increasing its efficiency and equalization of transportation services and access. Analysis results show that artificial intelligence and geospatial can be used to increase the user experience and optimize the services of public transportation.

    "abstract": "In wideband high-frequency (mmWave/THz) FDD cell-free massive MIMO systems, the uplink and downlink channels are decoupled in frequency, making it highly challenging for distributed access points (APs) to estimate downlink channels without explicit user feedback. To address this, we propose a novel inference-based method that treats the uplink-to-downlink channel relationship as a logical reasoning process. Specifically, we design a lightweight Transformer model that takes uplink channel estimates as logical premises and infers downlink coefficients as conclusions. This is motivated by the short-tap nature of high-frequency wideband channels in the time domain, which induces strong frequency-domain correlations in fading and phase across subcarriers. Building on this, the approach leverages a lightweight Transformer integrated with an SNR-adaptive multi-component loss. The loss dynamically optimizes training against SNR-varying error dominance. This obviates predefined mappings or iterative refinement, enabling efficient and generalizable channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher estimation accuracy, but also reduces computational complexity by up to 40% and lowers memory usage, making it well-suited for practical wideband FDD deployments."

    "abstract": "Algorithms for defining the phase modulation law to reduce the influence of passive noise are proposed and analyzed. The structure and algorithms of the bleaching filter exposed to passive noise in the form of a discrete Gaussian-Markov random process are determined. It is shown that the optimization problem of the phase modulation law can be formulated as the problem of determining the sequence of values of the initial phases of the probing signal by the criterion of minimum variance of the uncompensated passive noise residue at the output of the bleaching filter. It is advisable to choose the variance estimate as a quality indicator. It is shown that fulfilling the optimality condition leads to the choice of a phase modulation law that reduces the frequency of passive noise. The optimization conditions of the phase modulation law are determined. A numerical illustration of the proposed method for synthesizing the phase modulation law when two passive noise are superimposed is given. The structures of the bleaching filter are described for two practically significant cases. The values of the suppression coefficient of the bleaching filter are determined for different values of the Doppler phasing constants. It is shown that optimization of the phase modulation law in accordance with the proposed algorithms provides a significant gain in the value of the passive noise suppression coefficient compared to the case of using the unmodulated signal only at different values of Doppler phasing constants."

Traditional approaches relying on manual rules and static thresholds suffer from poor adaptability and inadequate detection of latent anomalies.

This significantly enhances the representation and modelling capabilities of high-dimensional features, effectively addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-method approaches in detection efficiency, model robustness, and result interpretability. Consequently, it achieves high-precision identification and rapid response to complexdata distributions and dynamic anomaly patterns. The key innovations include: (1) adaptability to unlabeled data, eliminating the dependency on supervised learning; (2) a collaborative multi-algorithm mechanism that enhances coverage of diverse anomalies; and (3) a closed-loop optimization ecosystem that outputs labeled data to drive iterative model improvement.

    "abstract": "The probability box (P-box) provides a robust framework for characterizing hybrid uncertainty by defining bounds on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable, making it highly significant for uncertainty propagation analysis in engineering and computational modeling. Current methods for computing P-box boundaries are mainly divided into sampling methods and analytical methods. Sampling methods suffer from low computational efficiency in high-dimensional complex models, while analytical methods are not applicable to black-box models. This paper proposes a novel parametric P-box uncertainty propagation method based on the separation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The method efficiently computes P-box boundaries by first determining the range of expected values for each variable to identify the function's maximum and minimum values, which serve as the midpoints of the P-box bounds. Subsequently, sampling points are generated based on the minimum and maximum standard deviations of each variable at its minimum and maximum values. These sampling points are then input into the model to obtain the corresponding CDF curves for the four combinations of function outputs. The boundaries of these CDF curves are used to define the P-box of the function output. This algorithm is computationally efficient and applicable to black-box models. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical simulation test for the HEG shock tunnel cylindrical model experiment, where the proposed method shows advantages over the Optimization via Simulation (OPS) approach in both computational accuracy and efficiency."

Specifically, the secret image is first compressed into a low-dimensional feature vector to reduce memory consumption; then the vector is fused with cover image features at the bottleneck of a U-Net generator to produce high-quality stego images; finally, a conditional discriminator is introduced to enforce consistency between the stego image and the hidden secret.

Notably, experiment shows that our model generates lip motions comparable to the state-of-the-art models, while capable of reproducing target facial expressions through cross-sequence reference adaptation.

The goal of the study is to create an algorithm that can reliably process both “simple” corpora with a clear structure and “complex” collections with heterogeneous topics, spelling errors, and informal speech elements. The algorithm includes preprocessing (normalization, tokenization), N-gram feature extraction (unigrams and bigrams) using TF-IDF, and training a multi-class logistic regression classifier (one-vs-rest). Three datasets of varying complexity were prepared for objective validation; metrics are evaluated in terms of Accuracy, Precision/Recall, and F1 (macro/micro), confusion matrices and PR curves are constructed, allowing for analysis of model behavior at class boundaries. Experiments have shown that the algorithm demonstrates high accuracy on structured texts (e.g., official business documents), with the best results achieved by using early stopping and careful hyperparameter tuning. Predictions are returned as categories with probabilities, simplifying threshold tuning and integration into real-world systems such as banking applications, electronic document management, and legal pipelines. A comparative review of alternative solutions was also conducted, highlighting key challenges in the field: sensitivity to code-switching and dialectal forms, dependence on the completeness of the feature dictionary, and degradation on “dirty” data. Planned development areas include expanding the training/test corpora, adding normalization modules (morphology, spelling, dialect), probability calibration, and transitioning to neural network architectures and contextual representations (e.g., transformers and sentence embeddings) for working with large, multidimensional data and increased language variability."

Recent mask embedding-based transformers combine spatial features with compact embeddings to reconstruct object masks. However, existing designs rely on static fusion and fixed matching strategies, which limits adaptability across diverse scenarios. In this work, we propose two lightweight and plug-and-play improvements. First, a Dynamic Gating Fusion (DGF) module adaptively balances spatial and embedding features through learnable channel-wise and spatial gates, enabling the model to emphasize fine details or semantic cues depending on context. Second, an Adaptive Matching and Loss Weighting (AMLW) scheme dynamically re-weights Hungarian matching costs and loss terms via a lightweight predictor, improving consistency between box and mask supervision. Both modules are training-stable and easy to integrate into existing frameworks without altering objectives or pipelines. The experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances training stability through the DGF and AMLW modules, effectively addressing the common convergence issues in deep learning and providing a reliable training framework for instance segmentation tasks. These results highlight the potential of dynamic mechanisms to enhance the robustness and stability of transformer-based instance segmentation in real-world intelligent systems, improving its adaptability in complex environments."

The control architecture considered is supposed to be hierarchically structured, featuring a discrete event system as its core, which serves to seamlessly interconnect all decision-making and execution levels within the hierarchy. To process asynchronous events and ensure critical behavioral constraints within the framework of supervisory control theory, we employ a non-Horn calculus of positively-constructed formulas powered by an intuitionistic inference engine. A pivotal element of the environment is a novel Domain-Specific Language (DSL), developed to allow for the intuitive and natural expression of the control system's logic in a manner that is directly aligned with problem-solving objectives. This DSL facilitates the description of system components and their interactions, which are then automatically translated for processing by the logical engine. The approach is illustrated through a case study of the classic Box Pushing problem."

Activation of the KRAS<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G12D</sup> oncogene in either AT1 or AT2 cells leads to the development of multifocal LUAD, but it is not fully understood how the cell of origin affects tumor characteristics observable through imaging techniques. In this study, we investigated the influence of cell origin on radiomic signatures by comparing LUAD models derived from SFTPC<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup> AT2 cells (SKTG) and GRAMD2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup> AT1 cells (GKTG). Using fast spin echo (FSE) MRI sequences, we identified distinct and cell-of-origin–specific radiomic profiles, with the SKTG tumors showing a greater number of significantly (p < 0.05) different features, indicating unique imaging phenotypes between the two tumor types. Notably, SKTG tumors exhibited increasing radiomic heterogeneity over time, which may correlate with a more aggressive tumor behavior and progression compared to GKTG tumors. These findings underscore the diagnostic and prognostic potential of radiomics to non-invasively differentiate LUAD lesions based on their cellular origin. By capturing tumor heterogeneity and progression longitudinally through imaging, radiomic analysis offers promising avenues for personalized treatment planning and improved patient management tailored to AT1- versus AT2-derived LUAD. This approach may ultimately enhance early detection, therapeutic response monitoring, and clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients."

    "abstract": "Mongolia's power system increasingly risks dynamic instability because of persistent capacity shortfalls, weak interconnections, and the rapid growth of variable renewables. These factors make frequency and voltage control difficult, especially during peak demand and seasonal shortages. This study proposes a coordinated voltage–frequency (V–F) regulation framework designed to limit instability during capacity-deficit conditions. We begin with a system diagnosis that treats the present crisis as a multidimensional vulnerability spanning structural, operational, and climatic stressors. Building on this, we introduce a region-wise Dynamic Stability Index (DSI) that supports real-time resilience assessment and prioritization of control actions. We validate the framework on detailed models of the Central Energy System, with case studies centered on the Khangai region. Across representative contingencies, the approach delivers faster recovery of the frequency nadir, tighter voltage profiles, and stronger damping of inter-area oscillations. The findings translate into actionable guidance for system operators and planners seeking to maintain stability as Mongolia's grid expands and its resource mix evolves."

    "abstract": "Categorizing critical information infrastructure objects is the initial stage in organizing their protection, and, therefore, the timeliness and correctness of the classification directly determines how quickly and effectively the protection against information security threats will be implemented. The paper presents an algorithm and software for classifying critical information infrastructure objects. To develop the classifier, neural network technology was used, which comprises several stages: determining the data formats that the classifier must support; identifying the operations that need to be performed with the data; establishing the functions that must be available to the user. The software structure consists of two parts: the function of training the neural network model and the function of classifying a new file. The interface of the critical information infrastructure object classifier contains the following elements: a button for loading training data; a button for classifying files; a window for outputting model estimates; a window for outputting classification results. The classifier was tested on prepared data."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of pulmonary diseases is of great clinical significance and public health value, as it facilitates early intervention, improves clinical outcomes, and reduces the overall disease burden. This study focuses on Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging and systematically evaluates the image classification performance of several mainstream visual models in the task of pulmonary disease recognition. Leveraging the advantages of CXR—namely its low cost, high efficiency, and minimal radiation—the research selects representative models across different architectural paradigms, including conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet; the Transformer-based Swin Transformer model; and the lightweight state space model Vision Mamba. A unified experimental framework is established to comprehensively compare these models on a public COVID-19 CXR dataset. The evaluation considers four dimensions: classification accuracy, weighted F1-score, computational complexity (measured in Floating Point Operations), and the number of trainable parameters. In addition, an ablation experiment is conducted to analyze the impact of training epochs, batch size, learning rate, and transfer learning strategies on model performance. The results demonstrate that Vision Mamba achieves superior classification performance (accuracy of 92.88%) while significantly reducing computational resource requirements, highlighting its strong potential for real-world deployment. This work provides valuable insights for the selection and optimization of artificial intelligence models in pulmonary disease diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The loss of low-voltage distribution lines in the power system is analyzed. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods such as low accuracy and local extreme values, this project will use the quantum particle swarm algorithm (QPSO) to calculate and analyze power line losses. Firstly, the topology, load distribution characteristics and line correlation coefficient of the power grid are analyzed, and the global optimization performance is improved by using QPSO, spatial information and adaptive threshold. QPSO and genetic algorithms are used to compare the measurement data. The simulation results show that the proposed method has high efficiency and good convergence, and can be used for precise positioning of line loss, thus providing an accurate decision-making reference."
