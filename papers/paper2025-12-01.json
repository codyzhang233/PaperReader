    "abstract": "Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the \"how\" process from the \"what\" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks."

    "abstract": "Previous work of the second author and Wolf showed that given a set $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension, there is a high rank quadratic factor $\\mathcal{B}$ of bounded complexity such that $A$ is approximately equal to a union of atoms of $\\mathcal{B}$. That proof yielded bounds of tower type on the linear and quadratic complexities. It was later shown by the same authors that the quadratic complexity can be improved to logarithmic, however that proof provided no improvement on the linear component. In this paper we prove that the bound on the linear complexity can be improved to a triple exponential in the case of linear rank functions, and a quadruple exponential for polynomial rank functions of higher degree. Our strategy is based on the one developed by Gishboliner, Wigderson, and Shapira to prove the analogous result in the hypergraph setting. Step 1 is to prove a``cylinder\" version of the quadratic arithmetic regularity lemma, which says that given a set $A\\subseteq G=\\mathbb{F}_p^n$, there is a partition of $G$ into atoms of (possibly distinct) quadratic factors of high rank and bounded complexity, so that most atoms in the partition are uniform with respect to the set $A$, in the sense of a certain local $U^3$ norm. Step 2 is to show that if $A$ has bounded $\\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension, then it has density near $0$ or $1$ on all atoms which are uniform in the sense of Step 1. Step 1 relies on a recent local version of the $U^3$ inverse theorem due to Prendiville, and is necessarily phrased in terms of a local $U^3$ norm implicit in that paper. On the other hand, Step 2 relies on a counting lemma for a different local $U^3$ due to Terry and Wolf, which we prove here is approximately the same as the local $U^3$ norm used in Step 1."

With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature -- due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features -- making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected H$α$ star formation rate of SFR$_{Hα} = 0.024 \\pm 0.001$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we find in the most \"star-forming\" clumps indications of lower ionization (log$_{10}$U $\\sim -3.2$), lower nebular metallicities (12+log$_{10}$O/H $\\lesssim$ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable H$β$ emission, we find (for the first time at $z>5$) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions -- highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn."

Previous work in one-dimensional periodic systems identified a fitness advantage associated with rapid dead-cell clearance, an \"opportunistic\" competition mechanism. Extending this framework, we study two-dimensional cellular aggregates and show that dimensionality modifies the interplay between competition mechanisms for clones with different clearance rates: in 2D, opportunistic and homeostatic-pressure-based competition jointly shape clonal selection, to varying degrees. We then introduce an explicit circular confinement to probe how boundaries modulate this interplay. While opportunistic competition persists, distinct timescale-dependent behaviors emerge through weakened homeostatic-pressure-based competition near boundaries. Structural analysis reveals that confinement promotes tangential alignment and spatially heterogeneous homeostatic pressure, thereby reshaping competitive outcomes at tissue edges. Our study connects newly discovered competition mechanisms with more realistic biological contexts, highlighting how dimensionality and spatial constraints influence tissue structures and modulate competition in heterogeneous cell populations, with implications for tumor growth dynamics and tissue development."

    "abstract": "Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies."

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments."

    "abstract": "Networks are often modeled using graphs, and within this setting we introduce the notion of $k$-fault-tolerant mutual visibility. Informally, a set of vertices $X \\subseteq V(G)$ in a graph $G$ is a $k$-fault-tolerant mutual-visibility set ($k$-ftmv set) if any two vertices in $X$ are connected by a bundle of $k+1$ shortest paths such that: ($i$) each shortest path contains no other vertex of $X$, and ($ii$) these paths are internally disjoint. The cardinality of a largest $k$-ftmv set is denoted by $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$. The classical notion of mutual visibility corresponds to the case $k = 0$. This generalized concept is motivated by applications in communication networks, where agents located at vertices must communicate both efficiently (i.e., via shortest paths) and confidentially (i.e., without messages passing through the location of any other agent). The original notion of mutual visibility may fail in unreliable networks, where vertices or links can become unavailable. Several properties of $k$-ftmv sets are established, including a natural relationship between $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ and $ω(G)$, as well as a characterization of graphs for which $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ is large. It is shown that computing $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ is NP-hard for any positive integer $k$, whether $k$ is fixed or not. Exact formulae for $\\mathrm{f}μ^{k}(G)$ are derived for several specific graph topologies, including grid-like networks such as cylinders and tori, and for diameter-two networks defined by Hamming graphs and by the direct product of complete graphs."

    "abstract": "The reachability problem in multi-pushdown automata (MPDA) has many applications in static analysis of recursive programs. An example is safety verification of multi-threaded recursive programs with shared memory. Since these problems are undecidable, the literature contains many decidable (and efficient) underapproximations of MPDA. A uniform framework that captures many of these underapproximations is that of bounded treewidth (tw): To each execution of the MPDA, we associate a graph; then we consider the subset of all graphs that have a wt at most $k$, for some constant $k$. In fact, bounding tw is a generic approach to obtain classes of systems with decidable reachability, even beyond MPDA underapproximations. The resulting systems are also called MSO-definable bounded-tw systems. While bounded tw is a powerful tool for reachability and similar types of analysis, the word languages (i.e. action sequences corresponding to executions) of these systems remain far from understood. For the slight restriction of bounded special tw, or \"bounded-stw\" (which is equivalent to bounded tw on MPDA, and even includes all bounded-tw systems studied in the literature), this work reveals a connection with multiple context-free languages (MCFL), a concept from computational linguistics. We show that the word languages of MSO-definable bounded-stw systems are exactly the MCFL. We exploit this connection to provide an optimal algorithm for computing downward closures (dcl) for MSO-definable bounded-stw systems. Computing dcl is a notoriously difficult task that has many applications in the verification of complex systems: As an example application, we show that in programs with dynamic spawning of MSO-definable bounded-stw processes, safety verification has the same complexity as in the case of processes with sequential recursive processes."

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks."

While many studies have shown correlations between global sea surface temperatures and characteristics of the West African monsoon season, there are few that effectively implementing this information into machine learning (ML) prediction models. In this study we investigated the best ways to define our target variables, onset and dry spell, and produced methods to predict them for upcoming seasons using sea surface temperature teleconnections. Defining our target variables required the use of a combination of two well known definitions of onset. We then applied custom statistical techniques -- like total variation regularization and predictor selection -- to the two models we constructed, the first being a linear model and the other an adaptive-threshold logistic regression model. We found mixed results for onset prediction, with spatial verification showing signs of significant skill, while temporal verification showed little to none. For dry spell though, we found significant accuracy through the analysis of multiple binary classification metrics. These models overcome some limitations that current approaches have, such as being computationally intensive and needing bias correction. We also introduce this study as a framework to use ML methods for targeted prediction of certain weather phenomenon using climatologically relevant variables. As we apply ML techniques to more problems, we see clear benefits for fields like meteorology and lay out a few new directions for further research."

Using flyer-plate impact experiments as a benchmark, we show that both two-dimensional (2D) models can reproduce the measured particle velocity histories, but through fundamentally different mechanisms. In the P-alpha framework, applying a pressure-dependent yield strength is essential to capture the particle velocity evolution, though calibration of other constitutive parameters, such as crush-out pressure, still strongly influences the response. In contrast, mesoscale simulations are less sensitive to parameter tuning and rely critically on the physical state variable of porosity, represented in 2D as an equivalent measure of the 3D specimen. Together, these results establish that their mechanical interpretations differ: continuum parameters act as effective surrogates for grain-scale physics, whereas mesoscale modeling reveals porosity as the dominant control of macroscopic wave onset."

This would be a classic (Bayesian) inverse problem if not for three challenges: (1) the computer simulations are slow, limiting the size of campaigns of runs; so (2) surrogate modeling is essential, but outputs are high-resolution images, thwarting conventional methods; and (3) IBEX observations are counts, whereas most inverse problem techniques assume Gaussian field data. To fill that gap we propose a novel approach to Bayesian inverse problems coupling a Poisson response with a sparse Gaussian process surrogate using the Vecchia approximation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed framework, which compare favorably to alternatives, through multiple simulated examples in terms of recovering \"true\" computer model parameters and accurate out-of-sample prediction.

Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs."

    "abstract": "SRAM-based cache memory faces several scalability limitations in deep nanoscale technologies, e.g., high leakage current, low cell stability, and low density. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead."

    "abstract": "Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps."

    "abstract": "Safety-critical environments are inherently dynamic. Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers. Across continual learning and foundation model fine-tuning benchmarks, our method matches or exceeds heuristic baselines for avoiding forgetting while providing formal safety guarantees."

    "abstract": "Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

    "abstract": "The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \\textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a \"low-bit\" exploration phase and a \"high-precision\" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning."

Applied to spinless fermions at filling $ν=1/3$ in models on the checkerboard and kagome lattices, our approach yields compact analytical formulas that predict FCI stability with over $>80 \\%$ accuracy in both regression and classification tasks, and remain reliable even in data-scarce regimes. The learned relations reveal model-dependent trends, clarifying the limits of Landau-level-mimicking heuristics. Our framework provides a general method for extracting simple, phenomenological \"laws\" that connect many-body phase stability to chosen physical descriptors, enabling rapid hypothesis formation and targeted design of quantum phases."

We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4. On 360M and 1B SLMs under matched training-token budgets, interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, enables robust cross-lingual continuation, and strengthens cross-lingual hidden-state alignment.

Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct \"cognitive tool\" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page"

    "abstract": "Finite mixture models are frequently used to uncover latent structures in high-dimensional datasets (e.g.\\ identifying clusters of patients in electronic health records). The inference of such structures can be performed in a Bayesian framework, and involves the use of sampling algorithms such as Gibbs samplers aimed at deriving posterior distribution of the probabilities of observations to belong to specific clusters. Unfortunately, traditional implementations of Gibbs samplers in this context often face critical challenges, such as inefficient use of computational resources and unnecessary updates for observations that are highly likely to remain in their current cluster. This paper introduces a new adaptive Gibbs sampler that improves the convergence efficiency over existing methods. In particular, our sampler is guided by a function that, at each iteration, uses the past of the chain to focus the updating on observations potentially misclassified in the current clustering, i.e.\\ those with a low probability of belonging to their current component. Through simulation studies and two real data analyses, we empirically demonstrate that, in terms of convergence time, our method tends to perform more efficiently compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Latin American higher education is often portrayed as equitable when tuition is free and access to public universities is formally unrestricted. Yet, growing research shows that massification under tuition-free policies often coexists with strong social and territorial stratification. This article uses four decades of administrative records from a faculty of engineering in north-western Argentina to examine how cohort composition has changed over time. Drawing on 24,133 first-time entrants (1980-2019), we construct a leakage-aware \"background census\" layer (N1c) harmonising school type, province, and age across legacy systems. We combine descriptive analyses, UMAP+DBSCAN clustering, and a reconstructed macroeconomic panel (inflation, unemployment, poverty, GDP) anchored at entry. All analyses explicitly report structural missingness patterns. Results show that missingness in background variables is historically patterned, declining sharply after the 1990s. Among students with observed data, the share coming from private-especially religious-secondary schools in high-income areas increased from less than half in the 1980s to roughly two-thirds in the 2010s. The catchment area became more local, with the home province gaining weight while distant origins lost ground. Median age at entry remained stable at 19, with persistent right tails of older entrants. Macro-linkage analyses reveal moderate associations between unemployment and older entry age, and between inflation and higher shares of students from interior provinces. We argue that free tuition and open entry have operated within, rather than against, stratified school and residential pipelines. The article illustrates how administrative data can support equity monitoring and discusses implications for upstream school policies and institutional accountability in tuition-free systems."

Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies."

However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks."

Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes.

Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline. As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs."

It hosts residual magnetic order below $T_{\\rm N} = 0.23$ K and a highly unusual $H-T$ phase diagram including three different incommensurate states. Spin-waves in the high-field polarized regime are well described by a Heisenberg-like triangular lattice Hamiltonian with a potential sub-leading bond dependent anisotropy term. We discuss possible candidate magnetic structures in the various observed phases and propose two mechanisms that could explain the field-dependent incommensurability, requiring either a small ferromagnetic Kitaev term or a tiny magneto-elastic $J-J'$ isosceles distortion driven by pseudospin-lattice coupling. We argue that the multi-$\\mathbf{q}$ ground state in zero magnetic field is a prime candidate for hosting the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal proposed on the triangular Heisenberg-Kitaev model.

To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures). Our diagnostic reveals what is learned, in what order, and where generalization fails, clarifying how RL-only post-training induces OOD generalization beyond what standard metrics such as pass@k reveal."

The implementation processes Paraver traces postmortem, reconstructing critical execution paths and handling common event anomalies, such as clock inconsistencies and unmatched MPI events, to robustly calculate metrics for each segment. The calculated per-window metric values expose transient performance bottlenecks that the timeaggregated metrics from existing tools may conceal.

CYGNO currently employs a very low-noise Hamamatsu sensor, the ORCA-Fusion, for testing and validation of its detection system. Hamamatsu has recently introduced two new sensors that may be of interest for future upgrades. The first is an improved version of the current model, the ORCA-Fusion-BT, featuring a back-illuminated design that reaches a quantum efficiency of up to 95% at 550 nm. The second is a next-generation sensor, the ORCA-Quest. Although its peak quantum efficiency is not as high as that of the Fusion-BT, it offers high sensitivity over a broader spectral range, extending into the ultraviolet region, and provides ultra-low readout noise of 0.27 electrons, about 2.6 times lower than that of the Fusion family. These two sensors therefore represent a significant opportunity to enhance the performance of scientific experiments, including those conducted by the CYGNO collaboration.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency."

By association, systematic inaccuracies in any buoy data are equally important, and thus when two buoy types provide systematically inconsistent information, this is a concern for anyone using an ocean wave model. This report is concerned with the accuracy of the high frequency portion of the ocean wave spectrum commonly observable by buoys, roughly 0.2 to 0.6 Hz. We evaluate four buoy types (two moored, two drifting) using two quantitative measures. The first involves comparing each type with a co-located ocean wave model. The second method involves evaluation of high frequency energy level as a function of wind speed. Both evaluation methods suggest that the Datawell Waverider (DWR) buoys have a strong tendency to report higher energy levels than the other three buoy types. We evaluate high frequency energy level using three different metrics (mean square slope, energy in a band of high frequencies, and spectral density at a single, specific band, 0.4 Hz), and the conclusions are found to be insensitive to the parameter used."

Conventional methods like Differential Privacy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) provide robust privacy protection via uniform noising, protecting PII regardless of its distinct sensitivity. This comes at the expense of the model's utility, leading to a trade-off. In this paper, we propose SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware approach that allocates noise based on the sensitivity of individual PII. We evaluated our method on four datasets (ABCD, CUSTOMERSIM, Wikitext-2, and UNSW-NB15 ). Our results show that SA-ADP achieves results comparable to the baseline (No-DP) and the conventional DP-SGD. This means that our method did not degrade the model's utility while still maintaining strong privacy protection."

A particularly important result is a completely nonlinear action for the 10-dimensional dynamical system of nearly coincident multiple D$0$-branes (mD$0$) which is doubly supersymmetric, i.e. it is invariant under both spacetime (target superspace) supersymmetry and the worldline supersymmetry; the latter is a counterpart of the local fermionic $κ$-symmetry characteristic of a single D$0$-brane (Dirichlet superparticle). This problem is approached in flat superspace using the (spinor) moving frame formalism, which provides us with a geometric framework to the treatment of supersymmetric particles and extended objects ($p$-branes) in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we have initiated the quantization program aimed at development of a field theory of multiple D$0$-branes. This quantization in its complete form is expected to lead to a novel supersymmetric field theory formulated on a superspace extended by additional bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates, whose development may offer significant insights into the deeper structure of String/M-theory."

To examine the effect, we introduce \\textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \\textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view.

However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data."

We introduce an analytic and numerical framework, grounded in nonlinear control theory, to infer the emergent frictional behavior of seismic faults. From noisy slip measurements, we first reconstruct the slip rate and frictional response in finite time using a Robust Exact Filtering Differentiator (REFD) that attenuates measurement noise. Building on these reconstructions, we design an exponentially convergent adaptive-gain observer that estimates the internal state variable and the key parameters (a - b) and dc of the rate-and-state friction (RSF) law, widely used in fault mechanics. Numerical experiments show that, in fast slip regimes where data are sufficiently rich, the method recovers RSF parameters with errors on the order of 20% and accurately tracks the RSF state variable despite noise contamination, whereas slowly varying sliding periods lack the observability required for reliable estimation. We also establish observability and identifiability conditions for the extended system, enabling the determination of additional parameters and outlining pathways for more advanced control-theoretic approaches to friction and state identification in fault systems. Although we apply the approach to a reduced spring-slider analogue, it improves on classical RSF calibration methods that depend on laboratory access to shear and normal stress. It also offers convergence guarantees and explicit error bounds, and it can further support model-based inversions that embed RSF in forward simulations."

Our results provide compelling evidence that PBSI is the dominant mechanism behind the SC gap modulations in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, offering new insights into the role of impurity scattering in iron-based superconductors."

    "abstract": "Metal-organic framework (MOF) databases have grown rapidly through experimental deposition and large-scale literature extraction, but recent analyses show that nearly half of their entries contain substantial structural errors. These inaccuracies propagate through high-throughput screening and machine-learning workflows, limiting the reliability of data-driven MOF discovery. Correcting such errors is exceptionally difficult because true repairs require integrating crystallographic files, synthesis descriptions, and contextual evidence scattered across the literature. Here we introduce LitMOF, a large language model-driven multi-agent framework that validates crystallographic information directly from the original literature and cross-validates it with database entries to repair structural errors. Applying LitMOF to the experimental MOF database (the CSD MOF Subset), we constructed LitMOF-DB, a curated set 118,464 computation-ready structures, including corrections of 69% (6,161 MOFs) of the invalid MOFs in the latest CoRE MOF database. Additionally, the system uncovered 12,646 experimentally reported MOFs absent from existing resources, substantially expanding the known experimental design space. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward self-correcting scientific databases and a generalizable paradigm for LLM-driven curation in materials science."

    "abstract": "It is believed that rays bent inside and outside photon spheres could affect partially the black hole shadow images by the Event Horizon Telescope and the rays near photon spheres would be detected by near-future space observations. The features of the rays near the photon spheres in not only black hole spacetimes but also exotic spacetimes would be important since one will need them to exclude black-hole mimickers. The deflection angles of the rays deflected by photon spheres diverge logarithmically and we can treat them by a strong-deflection-limit analysis. The error of the strong-deflection-limit analysis becomes large if antiphoton spheres exist in the spacetimes and the analysis breaks down when the photon spheres and the antiphoton spheres degenerate to form a marginally unstable photon sphere. This is because the deflection angles of the rays bent by the marginally unstable photon sphere diverge in powers. In this paper, we extend Eiroa, Romero, and Torres's method to gravitational lensing of rays inside and outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a general, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically-flat spacetime in strong deflection limits and we apply it to a Reissner-Nordström spacetime and a Hayward spacetime with the marginally unstable photon sphere. We have also confirmed that the deflection angles in the strong deflection limits by the method converge correctly to the deflection angle without approximations, while there are the mismatches of the coefficient of the power-divergent term of the deflection angles of the rays deflected just outside of the marginally unstable photon sphere in a semi-analytic calculation by the author previously."

Thus, there is a crucial need for reliability model that will enable us to predict precisely the life cycle of the device and point out on the governing failure mechanisms that are responsible for degradation and failure. This is even more important when high power and frequency devices, especially Normally Off Switch Power transistors are concerned, since the reliability research on those devices lay far behind that of low power digital devices. Our main goal in our lab is to investigate the failure mechanisms of GaN transistors, aimed at determining the reliability factors of the innovative MTOL model. The main goal is to understand the reason for the transformation of the failure mechanism. Employing the recorded data may enable us to predict the performance and life time of the device at different operation parameters such as current, voltage, frequency and temperatures. In this study we employ a new different use for the well-known boost convertor circuit, based on GaN Devices in order to stress the transistor to the maximum values of voltage and current which allows us to examine the reliability of the transistor and accelerating Hot Carrier And Trap Generation failures mechanisms. The acceleration of the failure mechanism should be done in a way that will not affect the electronic device detrimentally and on the other hand we would not need to wait a long time in order to observe the degradation. In this work we will present our new boost converter circuit based on high power GaN HEMT."

However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods."

As a decisive factor, the uncertainty of $S_{\\rm p}$ has been improved from 411 keV (Bayesian Machine Learning, BML) to 89 keV (BNN-BH) by taking the ensemble uncertainty into account and confining the error estimation to the neighboring nuclei. In consequence, the magnitude of the half-life's uncertainty can be reduced from 4 orders to 1 order, compared to that ($5.5_{-5.3}^{+636}$ ns) with $S_{\\rm p}$ from the BML model. We also found that the range of half-life predicted by the TRHBc + WKB approach is consistent with those from the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) + WKB approach, and with those from an empirical formalism with the $S_{\\rm p}$ obtained with the BNN-BH model. Furthermore, the means from the above 3 ways agree well with the experimental data for $^{149}$Lu, which gives us confidence to recommend a measurement of the half-life of proton emitter $^{148}$Lu."

    "abstract": "Recent observations of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQAGN) have shown the presence of millimeter emission, whose origin remains unknown, from within parsec scales of the central black hole. We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_ν\\sim{\\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\\rm mm}/L_X\\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions."

These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners."

The strategies these dogs use to navigate such challenges remain poorly understood, yet are critical for understanding their ecological adaptability and survival in human-dominated environments. A total of 156 randomly encountered free-ranging adult dogs were tested across 15 sites in Nadia district, West Bengal. Each individual was exposed to a single food source containing chicken placed in either lemon juice, diluted lemon solution, or water. All trials were video-recorded, and the behavioural sequences of the dogs, including sniffing, licking, eating, and food manipulation were coded and analysed to quantify strategic foraging responses under unpalatable conditions. They were found to use a flexible, multi-pronged strategy to manipulate the comparatively less palatable food option, and typically avoid the most unpalatable one, to maximize their acquiring options. Overall, this study revealed a hierarchically structured and context-dependent foraging strategy of free-ranging dogs, propelled by sensory evaluation, risk-reward balancing, and behavioural flexibility. These findings demonstrated how urban scavengers dynamically adapt to aversive conditions while scavenging, underscoring the cognitive mechanisms that support their survival in human-dominated environments."

Here, we perform a high-throughput computational screening of approximately 20,000 experimentally known three-dimensional stoichiometric inorganics obtained from the Materials Cloud 3D structure database. By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces."

Ultimately, Package Dashboard provides a unified view of risk, equipping developers and DevSecOps engineers with actionable insights to strengthen the transparency, trustworthiness, and traceability of open-source ecosystems.

Additionally, it detects privacy-violating behaviours, automatically responding by supplying spoofed data instead of the user's real data, without crashing or disrupting the apps. Unlike prior approaches, WhiteLie requires neither device rooting nor altering the app's binary, making it deployable on stock Android devices. Through experiments on more than 70 popular Android apps, we demonstrate that WhiteLie is able to deceive apps into accepting spoofed data without getting detected. Our evaluation further demonstrates that WhiteLie introduces negligible overhead in terms of battery usage, CPU consumption, and app execution latency. Our findings underscore the feasibility of implementing user-centric privacy-enhancing mechanisms within the existing Android ecosystem."

The tree-cotree decomposition is a gauging technique to recover uniqueness when using finite elements, which consists in considering the mesh as a graph, and building a spanning tree on that graph. The idea has been recently extended to isogeometric analysis, applying the construction of the spanning tree on the control mesh, or equivalently, on the Greville grid. In the present paper we extend the construction to hierarchical splines, a set of splines with multi-level structure for adaptive refinement, by constructing a spanning tree for each single level. Since for degree $p=1$ the spaces of finite elements and hierarchical splines coincide, the presented construction is also valid for quadrilateral finite element meshes with hanging nodes. To assess the correctness of the method, we present numerical results for Maxwell eigenvalue problem."

    "abstract": "Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors."

    "abstract": "Combined effects of transient ionizing and electromagnetic pulse on vertical NPN bipolar transistor were experimentally investigated under pulsed X-ray irradiation. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments."

    "abstract": "We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models \"know\" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This \"virtue signaling gap\" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge."

LLM2Fx-Tools uses a large language model (LLM) to understand audio inputs, select audio effects types, determine their order, and estimate parameters, guided by chain-of-thought (CoT) planning. We also present LP-Fx, a new instruction-following dataset with structured CoT annotations and tool calls for audio effects modules. Experiments show that LLM2Fx-Tools can infer an Fx-chain and its parameters from pairs of unprocessed and processed audio, enabled by autoregressive sequence modeling, tool calling, and CoT reasoning. We further validate the system in a style transfer setting, where audio effects information is transferred from a reference source and applied to new content. Finally, LLM-as-a-judge evaluation demonstrates that our approach generates appropriate CoT reasoning and responses for music production queries. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLM-based tool calling to audio effects modules, enabling interpretable and controllable music production."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model."

We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches."

We demonstrate that while all RIS architectures enhance the spectral efficiency, GNP BD-RIS achieves the highest gains.

    "abstract": "Modern HBM-based memory systems have evolved over generations while retaining cache line granularity accesses. Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency. To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead."

    "abstract": "Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation."

By engineering the geometry and orientation of the polarimetric units, sensitivity to linear and circular polarization components is achieved. A superpixel design comprising four polarimetric structures allows accurate reconstruction of the polarization state without moving parts or sequential measurements.

Their magnetic moment and nanoscale dimensions have long enabled applications in magnetic resonance imaging, targeted drug delivery, separation technologies, and hyperthermia. Beyond these well-established uses, a growing research direction has emerged at the interface of physics and biology: the application of MNPs in mechanobiology, the study of how mechanical forces regulate cellular and tissue functions. This review examines how Massart MNPs can be used to generate, transmit, and measure forces within living systems. Particular attention is given to interfacial control through advanced surface chemistries, which ensure colloidal stability, minimize toxicity, and preserve the nanoscale integrity of the particles. We also show that the robustness and scalability of Massart synthesis make it ideally suited to the production of biocompatible nanomaterials in quantities required for comprehensive biological studies. Two complementary approaches are discussed. The first exploits MNP assemblies that arise spontaneously within cells, in the form of endosomes. These compartments enable the application of controlled magnetic forces to study both the formation of reconstructed tissues and organoids, and their viscoelastic response. The second focuses on micrometric magnetic wires fabricated from MNPs, used in active microrheology to probe the cytoplasm of living cells over a wide frequency range. Together, these approaches illustrate how MNP assemblies can accurately quantify cellular and tissue mechanics, providing new opportunities for mechanobiological studies and enabling the development of novel readouts of cellular mechanics with potential diagnostic applications."

Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $χ^{(2)}$--$χ^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|χ^{(4)}|$ and $|χ^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $χ^{(3)}$ and $χ^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\\sim 10^8$ and $\\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry.

We study this distinction and show that samplable PAC substantially expands the power of efficient learners. We first construct a concept class that requires exponential sample complexity in standard PAC but is learnable with polynomial sample complexity in samplable PAC. We then lift this statistical separation to the computational setting and obtain a separation relative to a random oracle. Our proofs center around a new complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, that we introduce and study. These are sets for which membership is easy to determine but are extremely hard to sample from. Our results extend to the online setting to similarly show how its landscape changes when the adversary is assumed to be efficient instead of computationally unbounded."

Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors."

Above the critical width, we find that the mountain pass solution is a vortex with a solitonic behaviour in the infinite direction, called a solitonic vortex. Moreover, depending on the width, we prove that the minimizer in a space with some symmetries can display one or several solitonic vortices. While the problem shares some similarities with the analysis of stability and minimality of the Ginzburg-Landau vortex of degree one in a disk or the whole plane, the change in geometry introduces subtle analytical differences. Extensions to the case of an infinite cylinder in 3D are also given."

However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions. We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker. Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment."

We analyze a superalfvénic stream at a radial distances of $R \\approx 28 R_{sun}$ and a subalfvénic at $R \\approx 11 R_{sun}$, the former characterized by a prevalence of VDFs with suprathermal beams (also known as hammerhead). The Hermite analysis is also compared with various proxies of energization and dissipation, in order to establish a connection between turbulent cascades in real space and those in the velocity space. A qualitative agreement between the energization proxies and the Hermite analysis is observed. The results are suggestive of the presence of a dual cascade in real and velocity space."

    "abstract": "Our comprehension of the history of star formation at $z>3$ relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times. Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at $z=3$-$6$ with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion $H_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\mathrm{ch2}>2.25$. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\\rm H}α$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs."

In its quantitative form, it provides upper bounds on the decay of correlations for sufficiently smooth observables. Despite its wide applicability, determining the exact rates of mixing for a given smooth parabolic flow remains notoriously difficult. Apart from the classical horocycle flow, no examples are known where polynomial asymptotics, or sharp lower bounds, hold. In this paper, we address this question for smooth time-changes of horocycle flows on compact hyperbolic surfaces. Our approach relies on a refined version of the mixing-via-shearing method which leverages on a precise description of the ergodic integrals for horocycle flows, in particular of the regularity of the coefficients appearing in their asymptotic expansions. Using this method, we prove polynomial upper bounds on the decay of correlations for smooth observables that match the optimal rates originally obtained by Ratner for the standard horocycle flow. Furthermore, in the presence of a spectral gap below $1/4$, we establish exact polynomial asymptotics, mirroring the classical behavior of the horocycle flow."

Two such systems were deployed and evaluated in a real-world production setting. Key performance and reliability metrics were identified using simulation software to enhance these systems, alongside a System Dynamics analysis conducted for each. This work proposes a comprehensive framework for selecting and maintaining data protection and recovery solutions within organizational structures, outlining criteria for aligning chosen approaches with operational needs while adhering to predetermined timelines specified in business continuity and disaster recovery plans. The resulting analysis and findings offer actionable insights to guide decision-making when selecting appropriate recovery concepts."

In this work, we constrain the detection sensitivity for hyperbolic encounters of black hole pairs with a range of asymmetric masses. We employ BayesWave, a wavelet-based morphology-independent algorithm to characterize hyperbolic encounter waveforms in simulated detector noise; for this study, we explore the use of exponential shapelets. We find that a typical hyperbolic orbit with total mass $20 M_{\\odot}$ can be detected up to distance $d_L \\sim 40 - 200$ Mpc, and we forecast the possibility of detection by ground-based current and future gravitational wave interferometers."

In this paper, inspired by a practical application in the context of a decision support system for collaborative transportation in a Short Food Supply Chain (SFSC), we mainly focus on Traveling Salesman Games (TSGs), where the objective is to allocate the cost of a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with n locations and 1 depot to n players, each linked to exactly one of the locations. Given the computational complexity of computing an element of the core and the cost of a TSP, we study semicore allocations: a relaxation of the core that only requires that the subsets of size n -1 and of size 1 do not wish to deviate from the coalition. In the literature, instances of TSGs with empty cores and semicores are found. Hence, this paper first surveys the methods to approximate stability whenever the core is empty, such as the cost of stability (computing the minimum amount of money to subsidize the coalition with to attain stability) and the $ε$-core (which is a set of allocations that allow subsets of players to exceed their actual cost, but at most of a value of $ε$).

We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance. Experiments in the Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic and Turkish languages show that the use of clustering during the fine-tuning phase together with AL scheduling can simultaneously produce annotation savings up to 30% and performance improvements up to four F1 score points, while also providing better fine-tuning stability."

Using {\\it Spitzer} 8 and 24 micron, and unWISE 12 $μ$m images, HFSs are identified as regions where three or more filaments converge onto a central hub, appearing as absorption features toward IRDCs. In each IRDC, HFSs mainly lie at the intersections of elongated substructures, associated with groups of protostars and lacking radio continuum emission. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10--15 pc, with member separations of 1--3.3 pc. Around 65\\% are tightly clustered ($<$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores -- predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs -- reveals a median core separation of $\\sim$0.03 pc. The protostellar spacing ($\\sim$0.7 pc) significantly exceeds the thermal Jeans length ($\\sim$0.08 pc for temperature $\\sim$18 K and density $\\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$), whereas the core spacing is smaller than the Jeans length, suggesting that thermal fragmentation may influence core formation but alone cannot explain the larger-scale protostellar distribution. All these findings together support a picture in which fragments of clouds/filaments form clumps hosting compact HFSs that facilitate efficient and clustered star formation, often yielding massive stars."

The main challenge lies in integrating sentiment-related information from different modalities, which typically arises during the unimodal feature extraction phase and the multimodal feature fusion phase. Existing methods extract only shallow information from unimodal features during the extraction phase, neglecting sentimental differences across different personalities. During the fusion phase, they directly merge the feature information from each modality without considering differences at the feature level. This ultimately affects the model's recognition performance. To address this problem, we propose a personality-sentiment aligned multi-level fusion framework. We introduce personality traits during the feature extraction phase and propose a novel personality-sentiment alignment method to obtain personalized sentiment embeddings from the textual modality for the first time. In the fusion phase, we introduce a novel multi-level fusion method. This method gradually integrates sentimental information from textual, visual, and audio modalities through multimodal pre-fusion and a multi-level enhanced fusion strategy. Our method has been evaluated through multiple experiments on two commonly used datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results."

After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds. These results stand in sharp contrast with the behavior observed in local bistable equations."

We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes.

MD method is carried out to calculate the melting temperature, heat capacity, radial distribution function (RDF), Lindemann index, mean square displacement (MSD), and diffusion coefficients of these models. The findings demonstrate that nanoparticles rich in Cu exhibit a higher melting temperature and more defined phase transitions.

However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \\textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \\textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \\textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning.

    "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide variety of dynamical processes in science and engineering, yet obtaining their numerical solutions often requires high-resolution discretizations and repeated evaluations of complex operators, leading to substantial computational costs. Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful framework for learning mappings between function spaces directly from data, enabling efficient surrogate models for PDE systems. Among these architectures, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has become the most influential and widely adopted due to its elegant spectral formulation, which captures global correlations through learnable transformations in Fourier space while remaining invariant to discretization and resolution. Despite their success, the practical use of FNOs is often hindered by an incomplete understanding among practitioners of their theoretical foundations, practical constraints, and implementation details, which can lead to their incorrect or unreliable application. This work presents a comprehensive and practice-oriented guide to FNOs, unifying their mathematical principles with implementation strategies. We provide an intuitive exposition to the concepts of operator theory and signal-processing that underlie the FNO, detail its spectral parameterization and the computational design of all its components, and address common misunderstandings encountered in the literature. The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory. By connecting rigorous foundations with practical insight, this guide aims to establish a clear and reliable framework for applying FNOs effectively across diverse scientific and engineering fields."

    "abstract": "The pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprate superconductors harbours diverse manifestations of different ordered electronic-states, and then these ordered electronic-states coexist or compete with superconductivity. Here starting from the microscopic electron propagator, the nature of the ordered electronic-states in the pseudogap phase is investigated within the $T$-matrix approach. This $T$-matrix is derived in terms of the inverse of matrix for various kinds of a single impurity, and then is used to evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) by the involvement of all the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes. It is shown that a number of the anomalous properties in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is directly correlated to the opening of the normal-state pseudogap: (i) the structure of the microscopic octet scattering model generated by the normal-state pseudogap is essentially the same both in the superconducting (SC)-state and pseudogap phase, which naturally leads to that the quasiparticle scattering interference octet phenomenology observed in the SC-state exists in the pseudogap phase; (ii) however, the spectral weight at around the antinodal region in the SC-state is gapped out completely by both the SC gap and normal-state pseudogap, while it in the pseudogap phase is suppressed partially by the normal-state pseudogap, this directly leads to that the non-dispersive checkerboard charge ordering with a finite wave vector ${\\bf Q}$ appears in the pseudogap phase only. The theory therefore also shows that the electronic-states affected by the normal-state pseudogap exhibit the LDOS modulation spectrum organization."

Using a global framework, we employ ERA5 reanalysis data as predictors and IMERG precipitation estimates at $0.1^\\circ$ resolution as targets. A hierarchical location-based data split enables a systematic assessment of model performance across 15 regions around the world."

    "abstract": "Recently, the size-dependence of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in quantum dots has been investigated experimentally. In particular, for longer driving wavelengths and QDs smaller than 3\\,nm, HHG was strongly suppressed, however, there is no computational model capable of describing the strong-field response of such systems. In this work, we introduce a computationally efficient three-dimensional real-space tight-binding model specifically designed for the simulation of HHG in confined systems. The model parameters are meticulously derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the semiconductor bulk, followed by a process of Wannierization. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures the observed dependency of the HHG yield on the quantum dot size. Additionally, we simulate the HHG yield for elliptically polarized pulses for different QD-sizes and driving wavelengths up to $5\\,μ{\\mathrm{m}}$. The herein proposed model fills the theoretical void in simulating HHG within medium-sized nanostructures, which cannot be described by methods applied for periodic solids or small molecules or atoms."

    "abstract": "Nonequilibrium spatiotemporal patterns have been extensively studied. However, a single oscillator or cyclic loop of states is typically employed at each site in theories and simulations. Here, we investigated how competition among multiple identical cyclic loops at each site alters patterns. We simulated active Potts models with standard Potts interactions between neighboring sites in two-dimensional square lattices. When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies. Therefore, the number of spatially coexisting states can be controlled using flip networks and energies."

To facilitate the malicious activities, they continually register new domain names for exploitation. Previous work revealed an abnormally high concentration of malicious registrations in a handful of domain name registrars and top-level domains (TLDs). Anecdotal evidence suggests that low registration prices attract cybercriminals, implying that higher costs may potentially discourage them. However, no existing study has systematically analyzed the factors driving abuse, leaving a critical gap in understanding how different variables influence malicious registrations. In this report, we carefully distill the inclinations and aversions of malicious actors during the registration of new phishing domain names. We compile a comprehensive list of 73 features encompassing three main latent factors: registration attributes, proactive verification, and reactive security practices. Through a GLM regression analysis, we find that each dollar reduction in registration fees corresponds to a 49% increase in malicious domains. The availability of free services, such as web hosting, drives an 88% surge in phishing activities. Conversely, stringent restrictions cut down abuse by 63%, while registrars providing API access for domain registration or account creation experience a staggering 401% rise in malicious domains. This exploration may assist intermediaries involved in domain registration to develop tailored anti-abuse practices, yet aligning them with their economic incentives."

We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives. Two adaptive modulators, Frequency-based Adaptive Weight (FAW) and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation (FAM), reweight per-layer LF/HF signals and gate distillation by current similarity. Across U-Net and DiT backbones (e.g., Stable Diffusion 2, 3), FRAMER consistently improves PSNR/SSIM and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ). Ablations validate the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives."

We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $γ$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events.

This alignment yields narrower prediction intervals at the same target coverage, especially on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling matters. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners understand why intervals shrink when they do. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS consistently attains nominal coverage with improved efficiency and minimal overhead, offering a clear, practical upgrade to residual-based conformal baselines."

Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset."

    "abstract": "One of the most remarkable observations in heavy-ion collisions is the systematic regularity exhibited by pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles across collision energies. While single-source models fail at higher energies and independent multi-source approaches do not reproduce the central dip observed at LHC energies, a unified description across the full RHIC-LHC energy range remains elusive. These distributions from Au+Au collisions at RHIC ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6--200 GeV) and Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76--5.36 TeV) are analyzed using a novel parametrization based on coupled Gaussian sources where the interaction strength is quantified by parameter $λ$. This coupled two-source model captures the interaction between forward and backward sources through the medium formed in the collision. Remarkably, $λ$ exhibits empirical scaling behavior resembling $1/μ_B$, suggesting sensitivity to baryon stopping and the strongly-interacting medium. All fitting parameters follow systematic energy trends, with the peak-to-peak distance and chemical freeze-out temperature exhibiting identical exponential saturation patterns, indicating that geometric expansion and thermal evolution share a common underlying dynamics governed by QCD phase structure. Furthermore, the approach naturally preserves limiting fragmentation behavior across all energies, in contrast to independent source models that suggest its violation at LHC energies. Although the theoretical basis requires further investigation, these empirical correlations successfully unify charged particle production across nearly two orders of magnitude in collision energy, revealing fundamental connections to underlying collision dynamics."

However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators. The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33. Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in optics and time-resolved techniques have facilitated the exploration of new states of matter under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems."

In addition, we derive the central-upwind flux for a class of nonlocal conservation laws and use an estimate on the nonlocal speed which fixes the nonlocality at the cell interfaces. We prove that the resulting first-order numerical scheme converges to the correct solution. Under additional assumptions on the analytical flux we present a similar result for a second-order central-upwind scheme. Numerical examples compare the central-upwind schemes to Godunov-type schemes and the fully-discrete scheme."

We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations.

Simplicial complexes form through collections closed under faces and with simplex intersections either empty or common faces, verified by necessary and sufficient disjoint interior conditions, illustrated across dimensions from lines to tetrahedra plus non-examples.

An approximate dispersion relation indicates that the spectral properties of the present scheme outperform those of an underlying fifth-order scheme and even surpass those of a seventh-order scheme in certain wavenumber ranges.

Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability."

Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency."

    "abstract": "To investigate whether apparently non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are truly one-off transients, we conducted systematic follow-up observations of 27 out of 81 non-repeating FRBs identified in the Parkes Transient Database. Using 59.0 hours of data from the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and 6.3 hours from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 19-beam receiver, we searched for repeated bursts from these sources. No additional bursts were detected from any of the 27 FRBs. Combining these non-detections with prior archival observations, we derived stringent upper limits on their repetition rates above 1 Jy under two statistical models: Poisson process constraints range from $\\sim10^{-3.5}$ to $10^{-1.9}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, while Weibull process constraints range from $\\sim10^{-3.4}$ to $10^{-1.5}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude stricter than those reported in previous studies. By applying consistent observational setups and analytical methodologies across all sources, the derived rate limits converge to a narrow, well-defined range. This suggests that these FRBs form a relatively homogeneous population with extremely low intrinsic activity rates."

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth. To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technological paradigm for sixth generation (6G) mobile networks, aiming to unify sensing and communication in a spectrally efficient and hardware lightweight manner. Radio frequency ISAC (RF-ISAC) is constrained by spectrum crowding, limited sensing resolution, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. In contrast, optical ISAC (O-ISAC) leverages the large bandwidth and short wavelength of optical carriers and is regarded as an important complement to RF-ISAC. However, conventional O-ISAC relies on natural optical reflections from target surfaces, which generate weak echoes that are highly dependent on surface materials, thereby limiting the achievable sensing range and sensing accuracy. This article introduces retroreflective optical ISAC (RO-ISAC), which alleviates these limitations by equipping targets with compact retroreflective modules. These modules return incident light approximately back to the source over a useful range of incidence angles, forming a well controlled double pass optical path with strong and stable echoes, and thereby further unlocking the application potential of O-ISAC. The conceptual architecture of RO-ISAC is presented together with the underlying retroreflection mechanism. Key enabling technologies for RO-ISAC systems are discussed, including channel modeling, waveform design, bidirectional transmission, and multi-target sensing and communication, with representative details and experimental validation. The suitability of RO-ISAC is analyzed in indoor, aerial, underwater, and satellite scenarios, and challenges and research directions related to mobility, cooperative networking, intelligent operation, and sustainable deployment are outlined, pointing toward robust and scalable RO-ISAC deployment in future 6G networks."

Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence.

In this paper, we derive the massless scalar modes in $d$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and use it to compute the perturbative corrections to the leading and sub-leading soft photon theorems. Our framework corresponds to tree level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft photon in a compact region of the static patch of de Sitter.

    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript, especially those assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge."

Short-lived coherent antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes suppress dipole correlations within $\\sim$5 ps, while heavily damped soft/AFD modes and a defect-induced low-frequency mode ($\\sim$0.1-0.3 THz) jointly prevent long-range ferroelectric coherence in oxygen-vacancy-rich regions.

    "abstract": "Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) reduces computational costs in CFD by concentrating resolution where needed, but efficiently embedding complex, non-aligned geometries on GPUs remains challenging. We present a GPU-native algorithm for incorporating stationary triangle-mesh geometries into block-structured forest-of-octrees grids, performing both solid voxelization and automated near-wall refinement entirely on the device. The method employs local ray casting accelerated by a hierarchy of spatial bins, leveraging efficient grid-block traversal to eliminate the need for index orderings and hash tables commonly used in CPU pipelines, and enabling coalesced memory access without CPU-GPU synchronization. A flattened lookup table of cut-link distances between fluid and solid cells is constructed to support accurate interpolated bounce-back boundary conditions for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We implement this approach as an extension of the AGAL framework for GPU-based AMR and benchmark the geometry module using the Stanford Bunny (112K triangles) and XYZ RGB Dragon (7.2M triangles) models from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. The extended solver is validated for external flows past a circular/square cylinder (2D, $Re = 100$), and a sphere (3D, $\\text{Re}\\in\\{10, 15, 20\\}$). Results demonstrate that geometry handling and interpolation impose modest overhead while delivering accurate force predictions and stable near-wall resolution on adaptive Cartesian grids. The approach is general and applicable to other explicit solvers requiring GPU-resident geometry embedding."

They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten."

To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems."

Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow.

This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to further enhance system flexibility and proposes an optimization design for the spectrum efficiency of the STAR-RIS-UAV-assisted wireless communication system. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm capable of iteratively optimizing beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV positioning to maximize the system's sum rate through continuous interactions with the environment. To improve exploration in deterministic policies, we introduce a stochastic perturbation factor, which enhances exploration capabilities. As exploration is strengthened, the algorithm's ability to accurately evaluate the state-action value function becomes critical. Thus, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose a convolution-augmented deep deterministic policy gradient (CA-DDPG) algorithm that balances exploration and evaluation to improve the system's sum rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively interacts with the environment, optimizing the beamforming matrix, phase shift matrix, and UAV location, thereby improving system capacity and achieving better performance than other algorithms."

    "abstract": "Graph accelerators have emerged as a promising solution for processing large-scale sparse graphs, leveraging the in-situ compu-tation of ReRAM-based crossbars to maximize computational efficiency. However, existing designs suffer from memristor access overhead due to the large number of graph partitions. This leads to increased execution time, higher energy consumption, and re-duced circuit lifetime. This paper proposes a graph processing method that minimizes memristor write operations by identifying frequent subgraph patterns and assigning them to graph engines, referred to as static, allowing most subgraphs to be processed without a need for crossbar reconfiguration. Experimental results show speed up to 2.38x speedup and 7.23x energy savings com-pared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, our method extends the circuit lifetime by 2x compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM graph accelerators."

    "abstract": "Graph generation is a critical task across scientific domains. Existing methods fall broadly into two categories: autoregressive models, which iteratively expand graphs, and one-shot models, such as diffusion, which generate the full graph at once. In this work, we provide an analysis of these two paradigms and reveal a key trade-off: autoregressive models stand out in capturing fine-grained local structures, such as degree and clustering properties, whereas one-shot models excel at modeling global patterns, such as spectral distributions. Building on this, we propose LGDC (latent graph diffusion via spectrum-preserving coarsening), a hybrid framework that combines strengths of both approaches. LGDC employs a spectrum-preserving coarsening-decoarsening to bidirectionally map between graphs and a latent space, where diffusion efficiently generates latent graphs before expansion restores detail. This design captures both local and global properties with improved efficiency. Empirically, LGDC matches autoregressive models on locally structured datasets (Tree) and diffusion models on globally structured ones (Planar, Community-20), validating the benefits of hybrid generation."

However, recent MLLMs integrating images and text remain highly vulnerable to coordinated jailbreaks. Existing defenses primarily focus on the text, lacking robust multi-modal protection. As a result, studies indicate that MLLMs are more susceptible to malicious or unsafe instructions, unlike their text-only counterparts. In this paper, we proposed DefenSee, a robust and lightweight multi-modal black-box defense technique that leverages image variants transcription and cross-modal consistency checks, mimicking human judgment. Experiments on popular multi-modal jailbreak and benign datasets show that DefenSee consistently enhances MLLM robustness while better preserving performance on benign tasks compared to SOTA defenses. It reduces the ASR of jailbreak attacks to below 1.70% on MiniGPT4 using the MM-SafetyBench benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods under the same conditions."

The pipeline involves synthetic images used by the non-iterative horizon-based OPNAV algorithm, fed into an extended Kalman filter. The state estimate is used by a controller to maintain the spacecraft's motion within the vicinity of a reference NRHO. We study differential correction-based and minimization-based implementations of the x-axis crossing control scheme, and propose an improved targeting prediction scheme by incorporating the filter's state covariance with an unscented transform. We also introduce a hysteresis mechanism, which improves station-keeping cost and provides insight into the difference in performance between the differential correction-based and minimization-based approaches. We perform Monte-Carlo experiments to assess the pipeline's tracking and ΔV performances. We report several key findings, including the variability of the filter performance with the sensor field of view and measurement locations, station-keeping cost reduction achieved by the unscented transform-based prediction and hysteresis, as well as variability of the cumulative ΔV as a function of maneuver location due to the periodic structure in the OPNAV-based filter's estimation accuracy."

A search of shallower data obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, conducted when components A and B receded from 2.5 to 2.9~au from the Sun, yielded no detections, suggesting that the fragments had either ceased to exist or were not substantially active during this period. The uncertain fate of C/2019 Y4 highlights the challenge in understanding the state of presumably disrupted comets. Our review of six other presumably disrupted long-period comets reveals that negative confirmations were not reported for half of them, leaving their disruption presumptions inconclusive."

Weighting methods such as inverse probability of sampling weights (IPSW) reweight study participants to resemble a target population, but the accuracy of these estimates depends heavily on how well the chosen population represents the population of substantive interest. We conduct a simulation study grounded in empirical covariate distributions from several real-world data sources spanning a continuum from highly selective to broadly inclusive populations. Using treatment effect scenarios with varying levels of effect modification, we evaluate IPSW estimators of the population average treatment effect (PATE) across multiple candidate target populations. We quantify the bias that arises when the dataset used to operationalize the target population differs from the intended inference population, even when IPSW is correctly specified. Our results show that bias increases systematically as target populations diverge from a well-representative population, and that weighting to a poorly aligned target can introduce more bias than not weighting at all. These findings highlight that selecting an appropriate target population dataset is a critical design choice for valid generalization."

Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations."

Specifically, 1-bit samples of the radio-frequency signal are exchanged over the fronthaul. We investigate via both measurements and simulations based on an accurate model of the testbed hardware, the capability of the proposed architecture to provide uniform quality of services over the coverage area--one of the promises of D-MIMO. Our results are encouraging: for the case in which two user equipments (UEs) communicate over the same 75MHz signal bandwidth, the measured error-vector magnitude meets the 3GPP New Radio specification of 12.5\\% for 16QAM across all tested DMIMO scenarios. We also determine that uplink transmission is a potential bottleneck, due to the limited dynamic range of the automatic gain controller, which prevents the 1-bit quantizer to benefit from dithering. We show that this issue can be mitigated via UE power control."

Within a Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the electron charge density inside the electrodes, we derive the effective many-body potential for ions in an implicit solvent between Thomas-Fermi electrodes, taking into account the constraints of applied voltage and of global electro-neutrality of the system, as well as the 2D periodic boundary conditions along the electrode surfaces. We derive the average charge and the fluctuation-dissipation relation for the differential capacitance, highlighting the contribution of the fluctuations of the net ionic dipole moment, as well as those from the solvent polarization and of the electron density, whose fluctuations are suppressed within the Born-Oppenheimer description. We demonstrate the relevance of this model by validating its predictions against known results for the force on ions as a function of the ion-surface distance in simple geometries. The equilibrium ionic density profiles from BD simulations are in excellent agreement with those from an explicit electrode model for perfect metals, and are obtained at a significantly lower computational cost. Finally, we discuss with the present model the effect of the Thomas-Fermi screening length on the equilibrium ionic density profiles and the capacitance. While limited to parallel plate capacitors, the present simulation method allows to consider larger systems, lower concentrations, and longer time scales concentrations than molecular simulations in order to predict the electrochemical properties of Thomas-Fermi capacitors and correlate them with the ion dynamics."

KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI."

We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI."

By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO."

We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\\%$ of terrestrial gravity).

Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder.

    "abstract": "As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4."

To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a \"pre-train, then post-train\" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable \"concept swaps\", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots."

To validate the broad utility of our approach, we further introduce Proteina Atomistica, a unified flow-based framework that jointly learns the distribution of protein backbone structure, discrete sequences, and atomistic side chains without latent variables. We again find that training on our new sequence-structure data dramatically boosts benchmark performance, improving \\method's structural diversity by +73% and co-designability by +5%. Our work highlights the critical importance of aligned sequence-structure data for training high-performance de novo protein design models. All data will be publicly released."

    "abstract": "Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines."

Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments."

To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation.

It describes the dynamics of an autonomous Hamiltonian system on a regular energy level. It is called Zoll if the induced dynamics is a free circle action, up to a global time reparameterization. This article establishes a normal form theorem for odd-symplectic forms close to a Zoll one and cohomologous to it, which is then used to prove that Zoll odd-symplectic forms are the local maximizers of the associated systolic ratio. This generalizes the known systolic optimality of Zoll contact forms in the $C^3$-topology. As an application, local systolic inequalities are established in symplectic manifolds for hypersurfaces close to Zoll ones. In particular, this applies to certain non-exact twisted cotangent bundles of manifolds of dimension greater than two."

Using Widom scaling, we analyze this framework for several universality classes and show that in some cases the thermodynamic length across the phase transition remains finite. We then demonstrate a numerical approach for computing minimal paths in such systems. We show that, in some regimes, the shortest path crosses the phase transition - even when alternative paths confined to a single phase exist."

    "abstract": "Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems."

    "abstract": "Complex concentrated alloys with intrinsic chemical heterogeneity are promising candidates for nuclear applications, where local chemical order can strongly influence defect evolution under irradiation. Grain boundaries also contribute to radiation damage mitigation by serving as defect sinks, yet this interaction can alter interfacial structure, typically leading to destabilization and grain growth. This study investigates how chemical ordering influences grain boundary migration and stability during successive radiation events in CrCoNi. Using atomistic simulations, bicrystals were equilibrated to induce segregation-enhanced chemical order, followed by prolonged irradiation at 1100 K. Our results show that grain boundaries in random CrCoNi begin to migrate after only a few collision cascades, whereas those in the ordered alloy remain immobile until the chemical order is sufficiently disrupted. Single-cascade simulations reveal key mechanistic differences, where cascades near chemically ordered interfaces produce smaller damage volumes and reduced atomic displacement due to enhanced Frenkel pair combination within the cascade core. This limits both the residual defect population and the energetic driving force for interfacial rearrangement. Subsequent simulations of irradiated interfaces show that interstitial absorption induces a structural transition that modifies the segregation morphology at and near the grain boundary, demonstrating a dynamic coupling between ordering stability and defect evolution. These findings offer new insights into the role of local chemical order on defect-interface interactions under extreme conditions and highlight pathways for designing radiation-tolerant materials for next-generation nuclear systems."

However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions."

By analyzing this event, we conclude that the data is consistent with the binary black hole hypothesis, and we place a 90\\% upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of $\\tildeΛ < 34.8$.

In this study, we compute the valence and conduction band alignments of nonpolar ($a$-plane) and polar ($c$-plane) B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N, and compare them with those of AlN and GaN. Using density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, $GW_0$ method, and a novel passivation scheme, we find that they have near-zero valence band alignments for low-$x$ B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN, while higher compositions ($x > $0.333) exhibit type I or II band alignments. The band alignments also show a notable dependence on surface polarity and the tetrahedral distortion of the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures. Our computed offsets are in good agreement with available experimental data. Due to their low valence band alignments and higher conduction band alignments, the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN heterostructures could be well suited for high-electron-mobility transistors and ultraviolet light-emitting diodes. The band alignments of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N determined in this study provide essential design guidelines for integrating these ultra-wide bandgap alloys into advanced semiconductor technologies."

The experiment is designed to be completed independently by students within a single laboratory session and requires only basic prior knowledge from introductory communication engineering courses. A detailed script accompanies the experiment, guiding students through channel characterization, color detection, pseudoinverse computation, and simple data transmission using on-off keying. In pilot trials, students successfully reproduced the entire communication chain and achieved stable data rates of up to 0.5~bit/s over a 15~cm channel.

To obtain physically meaningful protein transitions, we couple this formulation to a new coarse-grained potential combining a Go-like term that preserves native backbone geometry with a Rouse-type elastic energy term from polymer physics; we refer to the resulting approach as SIDE. We evaluate SIDE on several proteins undergoing large-scale conformational changes and compare its performance with established methods such as MinActionPath and EBDIMS. SIDE generates smooth, low-energy trajectories that maintain molecular geometry and frequently recover experimentally supported intermediate states. Although challenges remain for highly complex motions-largely due to the simplified coarse-grained potential-our results demonstrate that SIDE offers a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for modeling bio-molecular conformational transitions."

To address these challenges, we propose a digital twin aided codebook learning framework, where a site-specific digital twin is leveraged to generate synthetic channel data for codebook learning. We also propose to learn separate codebooks for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight users, leveraging the geometric information provided by the digital twin. Simulation results demonstrate that the codebook learned from the digital twin can adapt to the environment geometry and user distribution, leading to high received signal-to-noise ratio performance.

Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. We observe that the task partitioning strategy affects the magnitude of forgetting: relation-based partitioning (grouping triples by relation type) exhibits 9.8 percentage points higher forgetting than randomly partitioned tasks (12.62% vs 2.81%), suggesting that task construction influences evaluation outcomes.

To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics."

    "abstract": "We present a framework for evaluating 6-DoF instance-level object pose estimators, focusing on those that require a single RGB (not RGB-D) image as input. Besides gaining intuition about how accurate these estimators are, we are interested in the degree to which they can serve as the sole perception mechanism for robotic grasping. To assess this, we perform grasping trials in a physics-based simulator, using image-based pose estimates to guide a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand in picking up 3D models of objects. Our experiments on a subset of the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) dataset compare five open-source object pose estimators and provide insights that were missing from the literature."

In this work, we cast registration as conditional generation: a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to a registered scene, from which the pose of each view is recovered. Unlike previous methods that conduct correspondence matching to estimate the transformation between a pair of point clouds and then optimize the pairwise transformations to realize multi-view registration, our model directly generates the registered point cloud. With a lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap, and generalizes across scales and sensor modalities. It further supports downstream tasks including relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and multi-session map merging. Source code available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/RAP."

However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \\textbf{PID} (\\textbf{P}hysical \\textbf{I}mplausibility \\textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \\textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \\textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \\textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models.

    "abstract": "Generative diversity varies significantly across discrete latent generative models such as AR, MIM, and Diffusion. We propose a diagnostic framework, grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, to analyze the underlying strategies resolving this behavior. The framework models generation as a conflict between a 'Compression Pressure' - a drive to minimize overall codebook entropy - and a 'Diversity Pressure' - a drive to maximize conditional entropy given an input. We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: \"Diversity-Prioritized\" (MIM), \"Compression-Prioritized\" (AR), and \"Decoupled\" (Diffusion). Our analysis provides a principled explanation for their behavioral differences and informs a novel inference-time diversity enhancement technique."

    "abstract": "The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks."

The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previous tasks degrades after training on a new task. This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods."

    "abstract": "The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories."

    "abstract": "The high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) reduces system inertia, leading to frequency stability concerns, especially during synchronous generator (SG) outages. To maintain frequency dynamics within secure limits while ensuring economic efficiency, frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) is employed. However, existing studies either neglect the frequency support capability and allocation of grid-forming (GFM) IBRs or suffer from limited accuracy in representing frequency dynamics due to model simplifications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based FCOPF (DL-FCOPF) framework. A DL model is first developed as a predictor to accurately estimate frequency-related metrics: the required reserved headroom and allocation of GFM IBRs, the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir. After being trained with data obtained from electromagnetic transient simulations, the DL model is reformulated and incorporated into FCOPF. Case studies conducted on two test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the traditional OPF and linear FCOPF benchmarks, the DL-FCOPF can optimally coordinate SGs and IBRs with minimum cost, achieving desired frequency response, within an acceptable computing time. Further-more, sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify the most suit-able structure and linearization approach of the DL-based frequency predictor."

Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation."

Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter. Moreover, we significantly improve the almost sure rate of convergence to the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, we establish the central limit theorem for our hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm. Finally, we show a surprising result on the almost sure convergence of the cumulative excess risk."

While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains."

    "abstract": "Simulating many-body open quantum systems is an extremely challenging problem, with methods often restricted to either models with nearest-neighbor interactions or semi-classical approximations. In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods."

The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware."

    "abstract": "We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive\" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits."

Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting."

The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs."

    "abstract": "Table recognition (TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks.

    "abstract": "When uncertainty meets costly information gathering, a fundamental question emerges: which data points should we probe to unlock near-optimal solutions? Sparsification of stochastic packing problems addresses this trade-off. The existing notions of sparsification measure the level of sparsity, called degree, as the ratio of queried items to the optimal solution size. While effective for matching and matroid-type problems with uniform structures, this cardinality-based approach fails for knapsack-type constraints where feasible sets exhibit dramatic structural variation. We introduce a polyhedral sparsification framework that measures the degree as the smallest scalar needed to embed the query set within a scaled feasibility polytope, naturally capturing redundancy without relying on cardinality. Our main contribution establishes that knapsack, multiple knapsack, and generalized assignment problems admit (1 - epsilon)-approximate sparsifiers with degree polynomial in 1/p and 1/epsilon -- where p denotes the independent activation probability of each element -- remarkably independent of problem dimensions. The key insight involves grouping items with similar weights and deploying a charging argument: when our query set misses an optimal item, we either substitute it with a queried item from the same group or leverage that group's excess contribution to compensate for the loss. This reveals an intriguing complexity-theoretic separation -- while the multiple knapsack problem lacks an FPTAS and generalized assignment is APX-hard, their sparsification counterparts admit efficient (1 - epsilon)-approximation algorithms that identify polynomial-degree query sets. Finally, we raise an open question: can such sparsification extend to general integer linear programs with degree independent of problem dimensions?"

To address this critical gap, we introduce CTF Archive, a platform designed to preserve the educational value of CTF competitions by centralizing and archiving hundreds of challenges spanning over a decade in fully configured, ready-to-use environments. By removing the complexity of environment setup, CTF Archive allows learners to focus directly on conceptual understanding rather than technical troubleshooting. The availability of these preserved challenges encourages in-depth research and exploration at the learner's pace, significantly enhancing conceptual comprehension without the pressures of live competition. Additionally, public accessibility lowers entry barriers, promoting an inclusive educational experience. Overall, CTF Archive provides a scalable solution to integrate persistent, practical cybersecurity learning into academic curricula."

However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks."

Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets.

Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to \"privileged\" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a \"generalist\" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

We present DrawingBench, a verification framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of agentic LLMs through spatial reasoning tasks that require generating sequences of low-level GUI actions. Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior. Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning. Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria. These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior.

The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations.

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty. In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches."

Here we propose a scheme to realize hybrid skin topological states in exciton polariton honeycomb lattices by introducing sublattice dependent gain and loss. This non Hermiticity couples with the intrinsic topological edge modes, leading to relocalization of edge states. We show two distinct regimes: hybrid skin Chern states with switchable localization controlled by TE TM splitting , and hybrid skin antichiral states which preserves the spin polarized property. Our results bridge polariton spin physics and non-Hermitian topology, opening routes toward controllable non reciprocal and spin polarized transport."

    "abstract": "We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40°C and 20°C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on α-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600°C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction."

    "abstract": "This study investigates ion kinetic effects during the parametric decay instability (PDI) of parallel-propagating Alfvén waves under plasma conditions characteristic of the Earth's ionosphere. By using a series of hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we examine the evolution of ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) in ultra-low-beta plasmas. Our numerical campaign systematically explores the dependence on key parameters (plasma beta, pump-wave amplitude and polarization, and ion composition). To emphasize the role of kinetic effects, we choose to trigger the PDI with a dispersive mother wave with wavelength comparable to the ion characteristic inertial length. Our results reveal pronounced nonthermal VDF modifications, including parallel heating and the formation of secondary ion beams, linked to the nonlinear evolution of parametric decay instability. By varying the plasma beta and the pump-wave amplitude, we identify a critical regime where rapid and complete broadening of the velocity distribution function is observed, triggering bidirectional ion acceleration. Notably, simulations modeling realistic ionospheric conditions demonstrate that even low-amplitude Alfvénic perturbations can induce significant VDF spreading and ion beam generation, with hydrogen ions exhibiting stronger effects than oxygen. These nonthermal microscopic processes offer a plausible mechanism for particle precipitation in space weather events. This work represents the first comprehensive study with hybrid simulations of PDI-driven ion kinetics in ultra-low-beta plasmas, providing quantitative estimates for the time delay between electromagnetic wave impact and ion VDF modification and new insights into wave-particle interactions that may contribute to ion acceleration, precipitation processes and space plasma dynamics."

In two classes of high-contrast regimes, we derive the asymptotics of both subwavelength and non-subwavelength resonances with respect to the contrast parameter.

    "abstract": "In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency."

Given any strictly decreasing radial vortex, we construct arbitrarily close (in low Hölder norms $C^α$, with $0<α< 1$) radial profiles that are merely non-increasing, for which non-radial, time-periodic solutions to the linearized equation exist. This shows that both axisymmetrization and inviscid damping are not robust under small, low-regularity perturbations of the background profile that violate strict monotonicity."

This research presents a comprehensive evaluation of artificial intelligence approaches for cybersecurity protection in nuclear infrastructure, using Argonne National Laboratory's Mechanisms Engineering Test Loop (METL) as an experimental platform. We developed a systematic evaluation framework encompassing four machine learning detection paradigms: Change Point Detection, LSTM-based Anomaly Detection, Dependency Violation analysis, and Autoencoder reconstruction methods. Our comprehensive attack taxonomy includes 15 distinct scenarios targeting reactor control systems, each implemented across five severity tiers to evaluate detection performance under varying attack intensities. The experimental evaluation encompassed 300 rigorous experiments using realistic METL operational data. Change Point Detection emerged as the leading approach with mean AUC performance of 0.785, followed by LSTM Anomaly Detection (0.636), Dependency Violation (0.621), and Autoencoder methods (0.580). Attack detectability varied significantly, with multi-site coordinated attacks proving most detectable (AUC = 0.739) while precision trust decay attacks presented the greatest detection challenge (AUC = 0.592). This work delivers practical performance benchmarks and reference architecture that advance AI-based cybersecurity capabilities for critical nuclear infrastructure, providing essential foundations for operational deployment and enhanced threat response in cyber-physical systems."

Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs."

This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively."

This study examines how forced migration relates to online information-seeking on Wikipedia. Focusing on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, we analyze how the resulting refugee crisis, which led to over six million Ukrainians fleeing across Europe, shaped views of Wikipedia articles about European cities. We compare changes in views of Ukrainian-language Wikipedia articles, used as a proxy for information-seeking by Ukrainians, with those in four other language editions. Our findings show that views of Ukrainian-language articles about European cities correlate more strongly with the number of Ukrainian refugees applying for temporary protection in European countries than views in other languages. Because Poland and Germany became the main destinations for refugees, we examine these countries more closely and find that applications for temporary protection in Polish and German cities are also more strongly correlated with views of their Ukrainian-language Wikipedia articles. We further analyze the timing between refugee flows to Poland and online information-seeking. Refugee border crossings occurred before increases in Ukrainian-language views of Polish city articles, indicating that information-seeking surged after displacement. This reactive pattern contrasts with the pre-departure planning typical of regular labor migration. Moreover, while official protection applications often lagged behind border crossings by weeks, Wikipedia activity rose almost immediately. Overall, Wikipedia usage offers a near real-time indicator of emerging migration patterns during crises."

A (flat) Manin-Frobenius manifold is a flat Riemannian manifold furnished with a commutative and associative product compatible with the metric, such that a certain potentiality property is satisfied. Curved Frobenius manifolds generalize this concept to spaces with non-vanishing curvature, and they have applications in supersymmetric mechanics and within the theory of submanifolds. Curved Frobenius manifolds naturally arise from Hessian metrics, and we find that they, conceptually, are the typical non-trivial examples. We obtain that Curved Frobenius structures on constant curvature spaces are consistent with a Hessian structure, if they satisfy a closed prolongation system of finite type. Consistency means that the Frobenius potential and the Hessian potential can be identified. As an application, we show that certain second-order maximally superintegrable systems correspond 1-to-1 to Curved Frobenius structures that are consistent with a Hessian structure."

However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5. To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability. These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation."

While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms."

To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/."

    "abstract": "Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel \"Reverse Construction\" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

When we make a cyclic thermodynamic transformation, the excesses are described in terms of a (geometric) Berry phase with corresponding Berry potential and Berry curvature quantifying the response. Focussing on Markov jump processes, we show how a non-zero Berry curvature leads to a breakdown of the thermodynamic Maxwell relations and of the Clausius heat theorem. We also present a variant of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in which the parameters follow a curve with vanishing Berry curvature, but the system still experiences a nonzero Berry phase. Finally, we identify (sufficient) no-localization conditions in terms of mean first-passage times under which the corresponding Berry potentials and curvatures vanish at absolute zero, extending, for arbitrary driving, e.g. the case of vanishing heat capacity as for the Nernst postulate."

We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems."

Their mathematically optimal decisions often diverge from human expectations, exposing a persistent gap between algorithmic and bounded human rationality. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework that operationalizes fairness as a learnable objective within optimization-based Digital Twins. We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems."

    "abstract": "As the emerging ferroelectric (FE) materials, the ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectrics without phase-matching bottleneck, usually exhibit the pronounced second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Despite the structural polarity of sliding ferroelectrics can be precisely detected via SHG characterizations, distinguishing the orientations of sliding ferroelectricity based on SHG responses has rarely been realized, as SHG intensities for upward and downward polarization states are supposed to be same. In current work, combining computational simulations and experimental characterizations, the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated to be readily distinguishable via SHG responses in 2D SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), a new sliding FE material. Specifically, owing to the unique symmetry operation within FE-SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), the intersection between \\c{hi}xxx and \\c{hi}yyy SHG susceptibility coefficients with opposite signs leads to the effective rotation of SHG polar directions upon switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Moreover, the remarkable dependence of SHG polar directions on the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is further validated by experimental characterizations performed on SnP2S6 crystal in a single FE domain structural form. This work opens up the avenue for in-situ detecting the ferroelectricity orientation of 2D sliding ferroelectrics based on SHG nonlinear optical responses, and also demonstrates the controllable optical nonlinearly for new \"slidetronics\" applications."

We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells.

Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision.

    "abstract": "Advanced deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely applied in audio, bioacoustic, and biomedical signal analysis, especially in data-scarce environments. While gated RNNs remain effective, they can be relatively over-parameterised and less training-efficient in some regimes, while linear RNNs tend to fall short in capturing the complexity inherent in bio-signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU), a {delay-gated state-space module for short-term temporal credit assignment} targeting audio and bioacoustic signals, which enhances short-term temporal state interactions and memory efficiency via a gated delay-line mechanism. Unlike previous Delayed Memory Units (DMU) that embed temporal dynamics into the delay-line architecture, the PDMU further compresses temporal information into vector representations using Legendre Memory Units (LMU). This design serves as a form of causal attention, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its reliance on past states and improve real-time learning performance. Notably, in low-information scenarios, the gating mechanism behaves similarly to skip connections by bypassing state decay and preserving early representations, thereby facilitating long-term memory retention. The PDMU is modular, supporting parallel training and sequential inference, and can be easily integrated into existing linear RNN frameworks. Furthermore, we introduce bidirectional, efficient, and spiking variants of the architecture, each offering additional gains in performance or energy efficiency. Experimental results on diverse audio and biomedical benchmarks demonstrate that the PDMU significantly enhances both memory capacity and overall model performance."

Two detection techniques $-$ tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) and a simplified wavelength modulation spectroscopy (sWMS) $-$ were implemented and evaluated. Laboratory calibration demonstrated linear responses for all gases (R$^2$ $\\approx$ 0.999) and detection precisions at 10 Hz of 311 ppb for CO$_2$, 8.87 ppb for CH$_4$, and 788 ppb for H$_2$O.

The TDLAS mode demonstrated lower noise and greater stability under outdoor conditions, while sWMS provided baseline-free spectra but was more sensitive to power fluctuations.

In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages combinations of pre-trained (language, policy) pairs to establish an efficient transfer pipeline. Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in achieving faster transfer across tasks."

It decouples core system functions from simulation logic and separates cognitive processes from physical environments and action execution. Consequently, Agent-Kernel achieves superior adaptability, configurability, reliability, and reusability. We validate the framework's superiority through two distinct applications: a simulation of the Universe 25 (Mouse Utopia) experiment, which demonstrates the handling of rapid population dynamics from birth to death; and a large-scale simulation of the Zhejiang University Campus Life, successfully coordinating 10,000 heterogeneous agents, including students and faculty."

    "abstract": "This PhD thesis explores the potential of quantum computing to address computational challenges in high-energy physics (HEP). As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages."

    "abstract": "Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) are increasingly adopted to protect sensitive workloads from privileged adversaries such as the hypervisor. While they provide strong isolation guarantees, existing CVM architectures lack first-class mechanisms for inter-CVM data sharing due to their disjoint memory model, making inter-CVM data exchange a performance bottleneck in compartmentalized or collaborative multi-CVM systems. Under this model, a CVM's accessible memory is either shared with the hypervisor or protected from both the hypervisor and all other CVMs. This design simplifies reasoning about memory ownership; however, it fundamentally precludes plaintext data sharing between CVMs because all inter-CVM communication must pass through hypervisor-accessible memory, requiring costly encryption and decryption to preserve confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we introduce CAEC, a system that enables protected memory sharing between CVMs. CAEC builds on Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) and extends its firmware to support Confidential Shared Memory (CSM), a memory region securely shared between multiple CVMs while remaining inaccessible to the hypervisor and all non-participating CVMs. CAEC's design is fully compatible with CCA hardware and introduces only a modest increase (4\\%) in CCA firmware code size. CAEC delivers substantial performance benefits across a range of workloads. For instance, inter-CVM communication over CAEC achieves up to 209$\\times$ reduction in CPU cycles compared to encryption-based mechanisms over hypervisor-accessible shared memory. By combining high performance, strong isolation guarantees, and attestable sharing semantics, CAEC provides a practical and scalable foundation for the next generation of trusted multi-CVM services across both edge and cloud environments."

Whether or not the twisted cuprates possess high$-$temperature topological superconductivity remains an outstanding issue. Here, we tackle this problem via an in$-$depth study of the key predicted feature $--$ half$-$integer Shapiro steps. We show that half$-$integer Shapiro steps do occur in samples at a twist angle of 45$^\\circ$ but are unstable with thermal cycling. Interestingly, fractional steps can be introduced by training the sample with a small magnetic field or annealing with a large electrical current, attesting to a tunable current$-$phase relation (CPR) in twisted cuprates. We extend the current annealing to realize fractional steps with odd denominators too. Furthermore, half$-$integer steps can be induced in the regime that is well beyond the expectation of topological superconductivity, favoring an alternative mechanism involving trapped vortices. Our results not only caution the direct association of half$-$integer Shapiro steps with the exotic mechanism but also open a distinct pathway toward a Josephson junction with electrically tunable CPR at high temperatures."

The secular decrease is caused by AML via magnetic braking, while the cyclic period variation is explained by the light-travel time effect due to a third body, which is likely to be a brown dwarf. Furthermore, our analysis indicates a mass transfer from the more massive component to the less massive one at a rate of $1.22(\\pm0.29) \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}}$. A model with a cool spot on each component was adopted to fit the O'Connell effect observed in the light curves. Since the O'Connell effect varies over time, we identified a solar-like magnetic activity cycle with a period of approximately 5.4 yr by analyzing the magnitude difference ($Δm$) at the two light maxima and the O'Connell effect ratio. In addition, evolutionary analysis suggests that V2790 Ori is a newly formed contact binary that evolved from a detached phase into the present contact configuration."

Starting from the commutator form of the orbital magnetization operator, we formulate an energy-resolved spectral function that is amenable to exact Chebyshev polynomial expansions and yields the total magnetization upon integration up to the Fermi level. This avoids the need for computing eigenstates and ground-state projects, providing an efficient numerical framework that is applicable to very large systems even in the presence of disorder and temperature. Our approach is benchmarked on the Haldane model, finding results that are in excellent agreement with the modern $k$-space formulation of orbital magnetization. Leveraging this technique, we extend our study to systems with uncorrelated disorder and point defects, and further show that the bulk Chern number can be directly obtained from the magnetization spectral density. These results open a promising route to investigate orbital responses and topological transitions in real-space models of quantum materials with realistic complexity."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications."

    "abstract": "We consider a particular class of 1D aperiodic models with the aim to understand how their internal degrees of freedom contribute to their topological invariants and the possible relations (correspondences) among them. In order to handle models with finite local complexity we introduce the principle of augmentation. This allows us to relate the values of the Integrated Density of States at gap energies for the bulk system to spectral flows. We consider two different augmentations. The first is based on the mapping torus construction. It leads to an alternative proof of the result that the gap labelling group of Bellissard coincides with that of Johnson-Moser. It furthermore allows for an interpretation of the spectral flow via boundary forces. The second augmentation applies to models obtained by the cut and project method where we find for 2-cut models two different spectral flows, one attached to the edge modes and related to the phason motion whereas the other is an augmented bulk invariant. Our approach is based on the well-established $C^*$-algebraic approach to solid state physics and the description of topological invariants by $K$-theory and cyclic cocycles. We also present numerical simulations to illustrate our theorems."

The early gamma-ray escape demonstrated by the radioactive tail is due to the large Ni-56 extension up to 7400 km/s. The early-time spectral evolution indicates the presence of the circumstellar dense confined envelope with the mass of 0.003-0.006 Msun within 6x10^{14} cm. The deceleration of the outermost ejecta implies the wind with the mass-loss rate of about 6x10^{-4} Msun/yr. The inferred mass-loss rate is by one-two order larger compared to most of type IIP supernovae, but comparable to the wind of type IIL SN 1998S. The asymmetry of the broad H-alpha component on day 144 powered by the circumstellar interaction is the outcome of the Thomson scattering and absorption in the Paschen continuum in the unshocked ejecta."

    "abstract": "Embodied navigation for long-horizon tasks, guided by complex natural language instructions, remains a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence. Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents."

Typically, their properties have been determined merely by analogy to the rather trivial one-dimensional case, leaving a gap between experimentally accessible observables and suitable theoretical models. Within a harmonic approximation, we characterise analytically a two-dimensional triangular lattice of active particles that interact with their nearest neighbours through a general pair potential, obtaining exact expressions for the correlators. We study this \"active crystal\" as a means of characterising active matter in the dense phase. Our treatment correctly approximates arbitrary pair potentials, rather than demanding an unphysical non-singular bilinear form. We retain \"off-diagonal\" terms that are routinely neglected despite quantifying the anisotropy of the particles' local potential. From the exact expressions for the correlation matrices, we derive exact results that shed light on the presence (or absence) of crystalline order. We further calculate the mean-squared particle separation, energy, entropy production rate and the onset of a pressure-induced instability resulting in the breakdown of the harmonic approximation. The entropy production rate is found to have a general form that is valid for generic active particles and lattice geometries, while resembling that of non-interacting \"active modes\"."

By integrating over $v$ in velocity space $\\mathbb{R}_v^d$ (velocity averaging), one gains regularity for the density in position space $\\mathbb{R}_x^d$. The concept was invented independently by V.I. Agoshkov and by F. Golse, B. Perthame, R. Sentis and P.-L. Lions, and successfully applied to the analysis of Vlasov or Boltzmann equations in \"classical kinetic theory\". In \"quantum kinetic theory\", the Schrödinger equation for the complex-valued \"wave function\" in the physical space is converted into the Wigner equation for the real-valued Wigner function in phase space (which can take negative values). The Wigner (\"Quantum Vlasov\") equation contains the transport term of classical kinetic equations plus a pseudo-differential operator containing the potential. We give answers to the long standing question of whether and to which extent averaging lemmas apply to the \"quantum\" case of the Wigner equation. The hard part are the \"semi-classical\" averaging lemmas, where one considers the asymptotics of vanishing Planck constant towards the non-negative Wigner measure. In that context \"pure vs. mixed states\" play a crucial role, as well as the connection between the Schrödinger equation and Quantum Hydrodynamics (QHD). We present the results for the classical and quantum cases and sketch the \"semi-classical\" case which is worked out in full detail in a follow-up article."

In the context of cellular mechanobiology, magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS), which employs rotating magnetic wires of length\\,! = 2-8 $μ$m to probe cytoplasmic rheology, has emerged as an effective method for quantifying intracellular viscoelasticity. This study examines microrheology data from three breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, along with new data from HeLa cervical cancer cells. Here, MRS is combined with finite element simulations to characterize the flow field induced by wire rotation in the cytoplasm. COMSOL simulations performed at low Reynolds numbers show that the flow velocity is localized around the wire, and display characteristic dumbbellshaped profiles. For wires representative of MRS experiments in cells, the product of shear rate and cytoplasmic relaxation time (''$ with $ ~ 1 s) remains below unity, indicating that the flow occurs within the linear regime. This outcome confirms that MRS can reliably measure the zeroshear viscosity of the intracellular medium in living cells. This study also demonstrates that integrating MRS intracellular measurements with COMSOL simulations significantly improves the reliability of in vitro assessments of cytoplasmic mechanical properties."

In this model, a strong crystal field in the tangential direction of the helix leads to the formation of energetically separated $σ$- and $π$-bands. In the second-order process, a spin in the $σ$-orbital virtually hops to the $π$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $σ$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $σ$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit."

These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations."

    "abstract": "Mountains represent a crucial natural resource for many regions worldwide, particularly in Mediterranean areas such as the Iberian Peninsula, where climate change can have profound consequences. However, due to their coarse resolution, traditional climate models cannot properly represent the complexity of orographic processes. Storm-resolving models, with horizontal resolutions finer than 10 km, offer a path forward to provide high-quality information for local adaptation even in complex terrain. In this work, we assess the performance of one such model, the IFS-FESOM developed within the EU-NextGEMS project, in simulating the historical seasonal snow cover in the main Iberian mountain ranges and projecting climate change effects. It is evaluated against four high-resolution reanalysis-based products, satellite, and in situ observations. Despite a positive bias in the length of the snow cover season and the number of snowfall days, the model can represent features of the snow climatology, such as its elevation dependency, seasonal cycle, and mean covered area, successfully within the range of uncertainty of the reference data. In addition, the projection under the SSP3-7.0 scenario shows a marked reduction of the snow season across almost all of Iberia, with low- to mid-elevations and the southernmost ranges showing the greatest reductions. These changes are linked to reduced snowfall days, caused primarily by rising temperatures but also by decreasing precipitation, particularly in southern and Mediterranean sectors. Our results suggest that storm-resolving simulations can provide local climate projections of snow information in complex terrain without regional downscaling."

In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \\(β_c\\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems."

However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning."

Within this framework, accretion is studied while consistently accounting for the backreaction on the metric components. Using a perturbative approach, we derive an expression for the effective black hole mass and for the evolution of both the black hole and cosmological apparent horizons under accretion. The analysis is performed in two distinct cosmological regimes: first, a matter-dominated era, and subsequently, a de Sitter era. In both cases, it is possible to determine analytically the instant in which accretion begins. For the matter-dominated era, the analytical expression shows that the greater the amount of matter available for accretion, the longer the accretion takes to start."

Such systems consist of two components whose interactions are mediated by three-body forces a mechanism not easily realized in conventional three-nucleon systems. We investigate two specific three-body hadronic systems, $\\bar{D}_sDK$ and $\\bar{D}^*Dη$, using contact-range potentials. The two-body hadron-hadron interactions are constrained by reproducing their scattering lengths, while the three-body couplings are constrained by charge symmetry. Our results indicate that three-body forces play a minor role in binding the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ $\\bar{D}_sDK$ system, but a crucial one in binding the $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ $\\bar{D}^*Dη$ system. In fact, three-body forces determine whether $\\bar{D} ^*Dη$ forms a bound state, making this system a promising candidate for exploring three-body forces in hadronic physics."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to study the influence of moisture on passive radiofrequency (RF) sensors associated with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate - multi walled carbon nanotubes (PEDOT:PSS-MWCNT) as a sensitive material. The designed sensor consists of a copper ring resonator and two PEDOT:PSS-MWCNT stubs located in the maximum electric fields of the fundamental resonant mode operating at 3.94 GHz. For performing a differential analysis, experiments are conducted by considering the resonant structure with and without a sensitive layer. Our experiments show the high interference of humidity on the sensor's performances and highlight the importance of differential study to decorrelate physical and chemical surrounding parameters. This differential innovative structure paves the way for a very high sensitive passive RF sensor dedicated for gas sensing."

This result is tight and confirms a conjecture posed by Narayanan and Sun. Additionally, we show tight bounds on the probabilistic throttling number, which captures the trade-off between the size of the initial set and the speed of propagation. Namely, we show that for every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, there exists an initial set consisting of $O(\\sqrt{n})$ vertices such that the expected propagation time is $O(\\sqrt{n})$. This improves upon previous results by Geneson and Hogben, and confirms another conjecture by Narayanan and Sun."

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing show that attention mechanism in Transformer networks, trained via masked-token prediction, enables models to capture the semantic context of the tokens and internalize the grammar of language. While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding \"in-between\" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design."

    "abstract": "Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation."

We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations."

    "abstract": "Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics. To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting."

    "abstract": "Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions."

We introduce the Error Correction Consistency Flow Model (ECCFM), an architecture-agnostic training framework for high-fidelity one-step decoding. By casting the reverse denoising process as a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and enforcing smoothness through a differential time regularization, ECCFM learns to map noisy signals along the decoding trajectory directly to the original codeword in a single inference step. Across multiple decoding benchmarks, ECCFM attains lower bit-error rates (BER) than autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines, with notable improvements on longer codes, while delivering inference speeds up from 30x to 100x faster than denoising diffusion decoders."

We show that the interplay of these three factors yields three qualitatively distinct escape mechanisms in diffusively coupled bistable elements, depending on the coupling strength. To clarify the relation between coupling strength and mean escape time, we derive effective one-dimensional dynamics: nonlinear mean-field Fokker-Planck equation in the weak-coupling regime, stochastic mean-field dynamics in the strong-coupling regime, and deterministic mean-field dynamics in the intermediate regime. We validate these reduced descriptions by comparing predictions with numerical simulations. We identify a distinct dominant driving factor of escape processes in each regime. Notably, the three escape mechanisms emerge through the interplay of nonlinearity, diffusive coupling, and dynamical noise -- rather than bifurcations of the noise-free system. Our approach serves as a framework applicable to other diffusively coupled stochastic nonlinear systems, motivating a further search for similar synergistic phenomena."

We propose PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings. At its core is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block, which integrates the efficient state-space modeling of Mamba and the bidirectional modeling power of Transformers. This enables PointNet4D to handle variable-length online sequences efficiently across different deployment scenarios. To enhance temporal understanding, we introduce 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy that captures motion cues across frames. Our extensive evaluations across 9 tasks on 7 datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse domains. We further demonstrate PointNet4D's utility by building two robotic application systems: 4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning, achieving substantial gains on the RoboTwin and HandoverSim benchmarks."

Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs.

However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our ReInversion method achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of the Worst-Case Deadline Failure Probability (WCDFP) has attracted growing attention as a means to provide safety assurances in complex systems such as robotic platforms and autonomous vehicles. WCDFP quantifies the likelihood of deadline misses under the most pessimistic operating conditions, and safe estimation is essential for dependable real-time applications. However, achieving high accuracy in WCDFP estimation often incurs significant computational cost. Recent studies have revealed that the classical assumption of the critical instant, the activation pattern traditionally considered to trigger the worst-case behavior, can lead to underestimation of WCDFP in probabilistic settings. This observation motivates the use of a revised critical instant formulation that more faithfully captures the true worst-case scenario. This paper investigates convolution-based methods for WCDFP estimation under this revised setting and proposes an optimization technique that accelerates convolution by improving the merge order. Extensive experiments with diverse execution-time distributions demonstrate that the proposed optimized Aggregate Convolution reduces computation time by up to an order of magnitude compared to Sequential Convolution, while retaining accurate and safe-sided WCDFP estimates. These results highlight the potential of the approach to provide both efficiency and reliability in probabilistic timing analysis for safety-critical real-time applications."

These materials enable simultaneous optical thermometry and electroluminescence, with LIR values showing excellent agreement with external thermocouple measurements over a broad temperature range. OLED devices incorporating these complexes demonstrate stable operation, and their luminescence properties are further enhanced by integration with engineered plasmonic metasurfaces. This integration leads to a significant increase in emission directionality and a reduction of the excited-state lifetime via Purcell enhancement, without compromising spectral integrity.

Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research."

A half-meter imaging monochromator, paired with a fast (10 MHz) camera operating at 1 MHz, was used to collect broadened chord-integrated spectral lines from the pinch region of a plasma deflagration device. Specifically, images of the $H_β$ and the $H_α$ lines were taken - with the $H_α$ used to find the background continuum. Voigt fits of the Abel inverted H$_β$ emission lines allowed for determination of the radial profile of the number density in the pinch at intervals of 1 $μ$s. This provided insight into the formation, growth, and decay of the pinch in both the deflagration and detonation modes of the accelerator. It was found that the maximum density for the deflagration increased from $\\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$ 1.4 cm away from the core of the pinch to $\\sim 10^{23}$ m$^{-3}$ at the core of the deflagration pinch. In contrast, the detonation pinch featured a broader zone of relatively constant density on the order of $\\sim 10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$. Furthermore, an energy balance of the plasma in the deflagration pinch and downstream, as informed by prior work, was done to get an estimate of temperatures in the core of the pinch where measurements are not currently possible revealing potential temperatures on the 550 eV in the core of the pinch suggesting departures from some of the assumptions in the analysis."

On average, models achieve OvertonScores of 0.35--0.41, with DeepSeek V3 performing best; yet all models remain far below the theoretical maximum of 1.0, revealing substantial headroom for improvement. Because repeated large-scale human studies are costly and slow, scalable evaluation tools are essential for model development. Hence, we propose an automated benchmark that achieves high rank correlation with human judgments ($ρ=0.88$), providing a practical proxy without replacing human assessment. By turning pluralistic alignment from a normative aim into a measurable benchmark, our work establishes a foundation for systematic progress toward more pluralistic LLMs."

Our approach builds on the original swarmalator model [4], introducing a key modification: the phase-dependent terms in the spatial dynamics are replaced with a simpler driving term that depends on both the phase and a specified origin. We investigate the dynamics of this model through extensive numerical simulations. When the origin is fixed, spiral motions of synchronized and clustered swarmalators emerge from a finite fraction of random initial conditions, resulting in collective currents. To prevent the unrealistic divergence of these spirals, we introduce a dynamic origin, defined as the center of the swarmalators' positions. With this dynamic origin, the system evolves into rotating collective currents, where synchronized swarmalators form stable circular patterns. In both the fixed and dynamic origin cases, we also observe no-current states, in which synchronized swarmalators aggregate near the origin. Finally, we find that the formation of collective currents can be facilitated by tuning the phase variables either at initialization or during the system's evolution."

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable. In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\\%) and SpQR (65.34\\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data."

    "abstract": "Humanoid robots have received significant research interests and advancements in recent years. Despite many successes, due to their morphology, dynamics and limitation of control policy, humanoid robots are prone to fall as compared to other embodiments like quadruped or wheeled robots. And its large weight, tall Center of Mass, high Degree-of-Freedom would cause serious hardware damages when falling uncontrolled, to both itself and surrounding objects. Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body. With comprehensive metrics and experiments, we quantify its performance with comparison to other methods, visualize its falling behaviors and successfully transfer it to real world platform."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies."

We also show that a single set-prediction head 1/20th the size of the backbone with no physical priors trained on frozen outputs from Panda can result in particle identification that is comparable with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction tools. Full fine-tuning further improves performance across all tasks."

    "abstract": "Wearable electronics hold great potential in defining new paradigms of modern healthcare, including personalized health management, precision medicine, and athletic performance optimization. This stems from their ability in enabling continuous, real-time health monitoring. To enable molecular-level analysis, biofluids rich in molecular analytes have become one of the most important target samples for wearable sensors. Among them, sweat stands out as an ideal candidate for next-generation wearable health monitoring platforms due to its completely noninvasive nature and ease of acquisition. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated feasible prototype designs for sweat-based wearable sensors. However, one of the major gaps toward large-scale commercialization is the development of clinically validated standards for sweat analysis. One key requirement is to establish the relationship between sweat analytes and those of blood, the latter serving as the gold standard in modern diagnostics. This review provides an overview of sweat biomarkers, with a particular focus on their partitioning mechanisms, which reveal the underlying connections between sweat analytes and their counterparts within systemic metabolic pathways. In addition, this review offers a mechanistic-level examination of biosensors employed in sweat sensing, addressing a gap that has not been adequately covered in prior reviews. Given the critical role of electronic systems in constructing highly integrated wearable sweat-monitoring platforms, this review also analyzes the electronic architectures used for sensor signal processing from an interdisciplinary perspective, with particular emphasis on the analog circuitry that interfaces with electrochemical sensors."

However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes.

    "abstract": "Large language model based agents are increasingly deployed in complex, tool augmented environments. While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations. We further discuss the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models."

Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\\mathcal{O}(ε)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field. Each of these terms are then handled via techniques that may be of independent interest."

In this work, we systematically investigate the defect properties of Bi2SeO5 using first-principles calculations based on a hybrid functional. Although Bi2SeO5 is a chemically ternary compound, each constituent element occupies several crystallographically nonequivalent sites, rendering its defect chemistry highly complex. Due to the anomalous +4 cationic valence state of Se, the defect formation energies of same main group anion antisite defects (SeO and OSe) are prohibitively high, and their concentrations can therefore be neglected. In contrast, the extraordinary cation-cation antisite defects BiSe and SeBi emerge as the dominant defects. The pronounced variability in the formation energies of the six types of VO defects demonstrates that identical defect types located on nonequivalent atomic sites can exhibit markedly different properties. Under O-rich and Se/Bi-poor conditions, Bi2SeO5 shows relatively robust p-type behavior. Conversely, under O-poor and Se/Bi-rich conditions, or at intermediate O, Se, and Bi partial pressures, Bi2SeO5 behaves as an intrinsic semiconductor or displays very weak n-type conductivity due to strong donor-acceptor compensation. This study provides theoretical insights to guide the design and development of high-performance Bi2SeO5-based electronic devices."

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) underpin applications in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and agent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon."

    "abstract": "High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations."

When applied recursively, this predictor forms a dynamic system representation. This data-driven representation is generally non-minimal, containing latent poles in addition to the system's original poles. In this article, we show that these latent poles are guaranteed to be stable through the use of the Moore-Penrose inverses of the data matrices, regardless of the system's stability and even in the presence of small noise in data. This result obviates the need to eliminate the latent poles through procedures that resort to low-rank approximation in data-driven control and analysis. It is then applied to construct a stabilizable and detectable realization from data, from which we design an output feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. Furthermore, we extend this principle to data-driven inversion, enabling asymptotic unknown input estimation for minimum-phase systems."

This is amplified by the fact that fuzzing campaigns often find a large number of crashing inputs, many of which share the same underlying bug. Crash deduplication is the task of finding such duplicate crashing inputs and thereby reducing the data that needs to be examined. Many existing deduplication approaches rely on comparing stack traces or other information that is collected when a program crashes. Although various metrics for measuring the similarity of such pieces of information have been proposed, many do not yield satisfactory deduplication results. In this work, we present GPTrace, a deduplication workflow that leverages a large language model to evaluate the similarity of various data sources associated with crashes by computing embedding vectors and supplying those as input to a clustering algorithm. We evaluate our approach on over 300 000 crashing inputs belonging to 50 ground truth labels from 14 different targets. The deduplication results produced by GPTrace show a noticeable improvement over hand-crafted stack trace comparison methods and even more complex state-of-the-art approaches that are less flexible."

Previously reported as a linear structure, the new observations show an unusual \"zig-zag\"-like structure, visible in radio-continuum total intensity, linear polarisation, and magnetic field orientations. The origin of this zig-zag structure is unclear, but we propose some origin scenarios that will require further observations to differentiate between."

    "abstract": "Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain. This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains."

Surprisingly, LLR has been found to improve worst-group accuracy even when the held-out set is an imbalanced subset of the training set. We initially hypothesize that this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' of LLR is explained by its ability to mitigate neural collapse through the held-out set, resulting in the implicit bias of gradient descent benefiting robustness. Our empirical investigation does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we present strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis: that the success of LLR is primarily due to better group balance in the held-out set. We conclude by showing how the recent algorithms CB-LLR and AFR perform implicit group-balancing to elicit a robustness improvement."

While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines."

We report 14 newly confirmed bona fide symbiotic stars and identify 6 additional strong candidates. Photometric variability was examined using our data and archival light curves from multiple all-sky surveys. Most systems are variable, with the majority showing periodic modulation consistent with orbital motion or pulsations. Possible photometric orbital periods are reported for 19 confirmed and 3 candidate systems, pending spectroscopic confirmation. Eight objects exhibit signs of outburst activity. In one of the systems, multiple brightenings occur at similar orbital phases, closely resembling the evolution of FN Sgr, a symbiotic binary with a magnetic white dwarf. The peculiar variability of another symbiotic star is best explained by dust-obscuration events. These results expand the census of Galactic symbiotic stars."

The time discretization employs a combination of the classical Newmark-$β$ scheme for the displacement and the midpoint scheme for the magnetization, applied in a decoupled fashion.

    "abstract": "Much of a solar flare's energy is thought to be released in the continuum. The optical continuum (white light) is of special interest due to the ability to observe it from the ground. We aim to investigate the prevalence of white-light (WL) emissions in simulations of purely electron beam-driven solar flares, what determines the occurrence of these enhancements, and the underlying causes. We utilized the F-CHROMA grid of flare simulations created using the radiative hydrodynamics code RADYN. We probed the spectral index, total energy, and low-energy cutoff to draw conclusions about their relationships to the white-light intensity. Furthermore, we calculated the 6684 Å continuum intensities, the Balmer, and the Paschen ratios. Finally, we analyzed two particular cases, one with high 6684 Å intensity and one with a large Balmer ratio, to determine the dominant mechanisms in these simulations. 33 of the 84 flares included in the F-CHROMA grid show white-light intensity enhancements that exceed 0.1% relative to the pre-flare level. We conclude that, with the parameters presented in the F-CHROMA grid, purely electron beam-driven simulations of solar flares are not able to reproduce observed WL enhancements, as the maximum enhancements in the grid are below 4%. The total energy (which is correlated with the maximum beam flux) is the main factor for deciding whether excess white-light emissions will be detectable. There is a linear relationship between the Balmer (and Paschen) ratio and the relative continuum increase. Both case studies show that during the time of maximum WL excess, hydrogen ionization and subsequent recombination in an optically thin medium is the dominant mechanism for WL continuum emission enhancements. Increased H$^-$ emission in the photosphere as a result of radiative backwarming becomes dominant during the declining phase of WL emissions in both case studies."

    "abstract": "The interpretation of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids typically relies on phenomenological dephasing times far shorter than what is expected from microscopic scattering processes. Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials."

By combining differential privacy with greedy updates that target only a few relevant edges per participant, Fed-Sparse-BNSL efficiently uses the privacy budget while keeping communication costs low. Our careful algorithmic design preserves model identifiability and enables accurate structure estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that Fed-Sparse-BNSL achieves utility close to non-private baselines while offering substantially stronger privacy and communication efficiency."

The ultraflat, high quality potassium film, fabricated via a rapid slipping-assisted oxide-free crystallization process, achieves an experimentally observed optical damping rate of 3.7 meV,with a measured imaginary permittivity of approximately 0.1 across the entire visible to near-infrared range (400-2000 nm). Near field optical spectroscopic measurements further confirmed the reduced losses by revealing deeply subwavelength confinement of optical modes. This result enhances our understanding of the factors governing plasmonic materials and devices and establishes a new platform for exploring extreme light-matter interactions in a variety of plasmonic systems."

Time-resolved extreme ultraviolet scattering measurements reveal distinct reciprocal-space features similar to those observed for permanent LIPSS but dissipating on the hundreds-of-picoseconds time scale. We show that the transient surface displacement patterns responsible for these features are produced via thermal expansion by the spatial modulation of absorbed laser intensity caused by scattering of the laser radiation by surface roughness and present a model accounting for the experimental observations.

In directly trained SNNs, static inputs are typically repeated across time steps, causing the temporal dimension to collapse into a rate like representation and preventing meaningful temporal modeling. This work revisits the reported performance gap between direct and rate based encodings and shows that it primarily stems from convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations rather than the encoding schemes themselves. To illustrate this mechanism level clarification, we introduce a minimal learnable temporal encoding that adds adaptive phase shifts to induce meaningful temporal variation from static inputs."

    "abstract": "Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $ε$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to a famous large-scale symbolic regression benchmark suite, then running the experiments to assess the symbolic regression landscape, demonstrating that a SR method with the contributions presented in this thesis achieves Pareto-optimal performance."

However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities."

In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \\textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \\textit{$\\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \\textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation\" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \\textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $Λ$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section."

Applying this algorithm to $k = 4$ and $n = 16$, we enumerate 1546 forbidden minors, 1718 forbidden subgraphs, and 12204 forbidden induced subgraphs. Assuming the above conjecture holds, these sets constitute the complete obstruction sets for graphs of treedepth at most 4."

    "abstract": "In simulations for modern free-electron laser (FEL), shot noise plays a crucial role. While it is inversely proportional to the number of electrons, shot noise is typically modeled using macroparticles, whose bunching factors correspond to those of the much larger number of electrons. For short-wavelength FELs, the macroparticles are assumed to be uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength, since shot noise dominates the initial radiation - for instance, in the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) regime. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold at longer wavelengths, particularly in the THz range, where the bunch current profile is not uniform over the scale of the resonant wavelength. Instead, the current profile dominates the initial bunching factors, which can be several orders of magnitude higher than shot noise. The slice-based bunching factors and bunching phases are derived for Gaussian distributions and compared with shot noise under the assumption that the current within each slice remains constant. Using the THz FEL at the photoinjector test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) as a case study, the influence of the current profile has been benchmarked through simulations under very low bunch charge, where the real number of electrons can be modeled using the Genesis1.3 code. Additional simulations with the nominal working parameters of PITZ THz FEL have been compared with experimental data, indicating better agreement when the actual current profile is taken into account."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and sustained hypertension is an often silent risk factor, making cuffless continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring with wearable devices important for early screening and long-term management. Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE)."

This conclusion is based on our first contribution, which is a state-of-the-art review and categorization of cybersecurity ontologies using the Framework for Ontologies Classification framework. To address this gap, we propose a revised framework for assessing credibility, introducing indicators such as institutional support, academic recognition, day-to-day practitioner validation, and industrial adoption. Based on these new credibility indicators, we construct a classification scheme designed to guide the selection of ontologies that are relevant to specific security needs. We then apply this framework to a concrete use case: the Franco-Luxembourgish research project ANCILE, which illustrates how a credibility-aware evaluation can reshape ontology selection for operational contexts."

Our pipeline maps the texture on a text image in a way that preserves the readability of the whole output while preserving legibility. The system also provides real-time adjustments for the user to change the scale of the texture and apply it to the text image. User evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively represents semantic meaning without compromising legibility, making it a robust and innovative tool for graphic design, logo creation, and artistic typography."

Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems."

The observations were obtained approximately 30 minutes before the onset of the X1.2 flare. The active region exhibited strongly curved penumbral filaments, sunspot rotation, and shear motions along the polarity inversion line (PIL), which led to a highly stressed magnetic field configuration that stored sufficient energy to release multiple M- and X-class flares. The first flare signatures appeared as small-scale brightenings, each with a width of a few tenths of an arcsecond, that trace penumbral filaments in the trailing sunspot."

In such frameworks, computational efficiency is severely constrained by the CFL condition when addressing stiff problems, and they fundamentally conflicts with spatiotemporal coupled methods whose core advantage lies in embedding stiff source terms. By fully leveraging temporal derivatives of physical variables within a rigorously derived compact mathematical framework, the scheme achieves fourth-order temporal accuracy in only two stages. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for A-stability is established through systematic theoretical and numerical investigation, and a Newton iterative procedure is provided to accelerate convergence. Extensive numerical experiments on classical stiff problems confirm the method's effectiveness and competitiveness."

We propose a parametrization of the polarization with the parameters calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function (KKR-GF) formalism. Within this approach the induced electric polarization of a unit cell is represented in terms of three-site parameters. Those antisymmetric with respect to spin permutation are seen as an ab-initio based counter-part to the phenomenological parameters used within the inverse-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction (DMI) model. Due to their relativistic origin, these parameters are responsible for the electric polarization induced in the presence of a non-collinear spin alignment in materials with a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Beyond to this, our approach gives direct access to the element- or site-resolved electric polarization. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, we consider several examples of the so-called type II multiferroics, for which the magneto-electric effect is observed either as a consequence of an applied magnetic field (we use Cr$_2$O$_3$ as a prototype), or as a result of a phase transition to a spin-spiral magnetic state, as for instance in MnI$_2$, CuCrO$_2$ and AgCrO$_2$."

    "abstract": "Young, massive stellar clusters offer a prime setting to explore brown dwarf (BD) formation under high densities and intense UV radiation. Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses < 0.03 MSun."

Using a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to describe heavy quark evolution inside the QGP and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for their hadronization, we find heavy quark energy loss softens the invariant mass spectrum of their decayed dielectrons and yields a higher value of the extracted QGP temperature, while coalescence hardens the spectrum and yields a lower value. Taking into account full medium effects leads to higher values of the extracted temperature than using vacuum baselines of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in analyzing the experimental data. In addition, we find the angular correlations between dielectron pairs are sensitive to heavy quark interactions with the QGP: the radial flow of the QGP enhances the near-side correlations, and scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP broaden the away-side correlations, with elastic and string interactions playing a dominant role."

In this paper, we study ICL for deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) in image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where an ICL denoiser is employed for MIMO symbol estimation. We first study the transceiver without any hardware impairments and explore the integration of transformer-based ICL with DeepJSCC in both open-loop and closed-loop MIMO systems, depending on the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. For both open-loop and closed-loop scenarios, we propose two MIMO transceiver architectures that leverage context information, i.e., pilot sequences and their outputs, as additional inputs, enabling the DeepJSCC encoder, DeepJSCC decoder, and the ICL denoiser to jointly learn encoding, decoding, and estimation strategies tailored to each channel realization. Next, we extend our study to a more challenging scenario where the transceiver suffers from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance, resulting in nonlinear MIMO estimation. In this case, the context information is also exploited, facilitating joint learning across the DeepJSCC encoder, decoder, and the ICL denoiser under hardware impairments and varying channel conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the ICL denoiser for MIMO estimation significantly outperforms the conventional least-squares method, with even greater advantages under IQ imbalance. Moreover, the proposed transformer-based ICL framework, integrated with contextual information, achieves significant improvements in end-to-end image reconstruction quality under transceiver IQ imbalance."

In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone.

However, accurate calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective fusion. This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. Extensive evaluations on both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, including AGV-mounted sensor configurations, demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions."

Kelvin probe method revealed upward band bending caused by oxygen adsorption during RTP. Electrical measurements confirmed that rectifying junctions were manufactured and that they are able to produce photocurrent in the spectral range of 450-1150 nm without external voltage bias. Introducing Eu into CdO was found to increase e.g. rectifying factor and responsivity. The results show that doping CdO with Eu is a way to enhance performance of the presented zero-power-consumption photodetectors, making it a promising material for future applications in optoelectronics."

    "abstract": "Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\\sim$85% have [Fe/H]<-2, and that roughly $\\sim$17% have [Fe/H]<-3."

When the problem also involves multiple objectives, the impact of the objective coefficients on runtimes and numerical issues multiplies. We address this issue by transforming the coefficients of linear objective functions into smaller integer coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been defined before. Next to a straightforward scaling heuristic, we introduce a novel exact transformation approach for the preprocessing of multi-objective binary problems. In this exact approach, the large or widely ranged integer objective coefficients are transformed into the minimal integer objective coefficients that preserve the dominance relation of the points in the objective space. The transformation problem is solved with an integer programming formulation with an exponential number of constraints. We present a cutting-plane algorithm that can efficiently handle the problem size. In a first computational study, we analyze how often and in which settings the transformation actually leads to smaller coefficients. In a second study, we evaluate how the exact transformation and a typical scaling heuristic, when used as preprocessing, affect the runtime and numerical stability of the Defining Point Algorithm."

If the subject is of interest to industry, online offering also allows industry experts to contribute and participate with ease. Advanced topics in Software Engineering are ideally suited for experimenting with this approach as industry, which is often looking to incorporate advances in software engineering in their practices, is likely to agree to contribute and participate. In this paper we describe an experiment in teaching a course titled \"AI in Software Engineering\" jointly between two institutions with active industry participation, and share our and student's experience.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their promising capabilities of generating robot operation code to enable LLM-driven robots. To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating se- mantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators."

We introduce a phenomenological transfer function model for a dark sector with a species undergoing DAOs which can accommodate sub-dominant dark matter abundances, and obtain constraints on its parameters. In order to predict the UVLF, we employ an Extended Press-Schechter formalism which we calibrate using N-body simulations with initial conditions featuring DAOs. Using measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we constrain the wave number of the first DAO peak to be at $k \\gtrsim 50\\ h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$, unless the fraction of dark matter undergoing DAOs is less than $0.07$."

We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games."

We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers."

However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs."

    "abstract": "Low-rank approximation methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and its variants (e.g., Fisher-weighted SVD, Activation SVD) have recently emerged as effective tools for neural network compression. In this setting, decomposition acts as a \"surgical\" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as \"rehab\" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points.

This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input."

Fast polynomial modular multiplication and fast pointwise multiplication problems are important for cryptosystem applications such as post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption. By establishing the equivalence of these problems, we show that a fast structure from one domain can be used to design a fast structure for another domain. This understanding is important as there are many well known solutions for fast convolution that can be used in other signal processing and cryptosystem applications."

In the primary visual cortex (V1), neural responses are modulated by non-visual context such as the animal's position. However, the spatial profile of these position signals across the environment remains unknown. Here, we propose a new framework to disentangle visual and spatial contributions in virtual reality. This method relies on two principles: 1) a virtual corridor design that decorrelates vision and space through targeted cue repetitions and manipulations and 2) a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that explicitly estimates visual contributions in retinotopic rather than environmental coordinates. In simulations, we demonstrate that this framework is highly specific (recovering spatial modulation only when present) and effectively captures the profile and weight of spatial gain fields across the environment. When applied to V1 recordings from mice navigating the virtual corridor, the model isolated significant spatial components in a substantial fraction of V1 neurons. The recovered spatial components exhibited heterogeneous, often multi-peaked, profiles. Application of this framework to large-scale recordings may provide a robust approach to characterize the nature of spatial signals modulating sensory processing across brain areas."

We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for the LR-Heisenberg model in two dimensions (2D) up to linear size $L=8192$, and show that, as long as for $σ\\leq 2$, the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, via a single continuous phase transition, and develops a generic long-range order. We then introduce an LR simple random walk (LR-SRW) with the total walk length fixed at O($L^d$), satisfying the extensivity of statistical systems, and observe that the LR-SRW can faithfully characterize the low-T scaling behaviors of the LR-Heisenberg model in both 2D and 3D, as induced by Goldstone-mode fluctuations. Finally, based on insights from LR-SRW, we propose a general criterion for the phase transition and the low-T properties of LR statistical systems with continuous symmetry in any spatial dimension."

Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers."

A long-standing conceptual gap in this framework is that, unlike $M$, $T$, $S$, $Ω$, and $J$, the thermodynamic volume $\\mathcal{V}$ lacks a first-principles definition and can only be deduced from other thermodynamic quantities. This deficiency indicates that the underlying origin of $\\mathcal{V}$ has remained poorly understood. In this work, we resolve this issue and provide an explicit universal formula for $\\mathcal{V}$. We demonstrate that it universally decomposes into two contributions, one arising from the explicit dependence of the action on the couplings and the other from the response of the fundamental dynamical fields. This clarifies the physical meaning of thermodynamic volume and places it on the same footing as other intrinsic thermodynamic quantities."

This paper presents a comparative study for selecting metrics for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for net load profiles of residential, industrial, and office buildings under increased DER penetration. A variety of statistical metrics is evaluated for their usefulness in quantifying un- certainty, including, but not limited to, standard deviation, entropy, ramps, and distance metrics. The proposed metrics are classified into baseline-free, with baseline and error-based. These UQ metrics are evaluated for increased penetration of EV and PV. The results highlight suitable metrics to quantify uncertainty per consumer type and demonstrate how net load uncertainty is affected by EV and PV adoption. Additionally, it is observed that joint consideration of EV and PV can reduce overall uncertainty due to compensatory effects of EV charging and PV generation due to temporal alignment during the day. Uncertainty reduction is observed across all datasets and is most pronounced for the office building dataset."

Water emission in the Horsehead nebula is very weak and, surprisingly, extends outward beyond other PDR tracers such as $^{12}$CO or [CI] 609 $μ$m, reaching as far out as [CII] 158 $μ$m. We model the observations using a newly developed PDR wrapper that takes into account the geometry of this region. PDR modeling of the molecular and atomic lines studied here provides strong constraints on the thermal pressure, but not on the UV illumination. Maximum model line intensities %typically agree to within ~40\\% with the observations. and spatial profiles are well reproduced, except for CO isotopologues, where the increase on the illuminated side of the PDR is steeper than observed. Water vapor abundance in the model reaches $3.6 \\times 10^{-7}$ at $A_V \\sim 3$ mag. However, the ground state $o$-H$_2$O 557 GHz line is systematically overestimated by the models by at least a factor of 7 for any values of the model parameters. This line has a very high optical depth and the emergent line intensity is sensitive to radiative transfer effects such as line scattering by water molecules in a low-density halo surrounding the dense PDR and the assumed microturbulent line width. A more accurate model of the water surface chemistry is required."

Our main result is an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(6^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. We achieve this through an involved subroutine for merging partial solutions at union nodes in the expression. In the usual way this results in a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm for solving the decision problem in the same time. We complement these by a matching lower bound under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). This closes an open question that appeared multiple times in the literature [ESA 23, ICALP 24, IPEC 25]. We also present an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a tree decomposition of width $k$ of $G$, in time $O(3^kn^c)$ counts modulo $2$ the number of feedback vertex sets of $G$ of each size. This matches the known SETH-tight bound for the decision version, which was obtained using the celebrated cut-and-count technique [FOCS 11, TALG 22]. Unlike other applications of cut-and-count, which use the isolation lemma to reduce a decision problem to counting solutions modulo $2$, this bound was obtained via counting other objects, leaving the complexity of counting solutions modulo $2$ open. Finally, we present a one-sided error Monte-Carlo algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k$-clique expression of $G$, in time $O(18^kn^c)$ decides the existence of a connected feedback vertex set of size $b$ in $G$.

Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost. This work provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics."

We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies."

We have observed a puzzling, unprecedented chromospheric fibril singularity in close vicinity of a blow-out solar jet and a flaring loop. We aim to understand the magnetic nature of this singularity and the cause of its activity using coordinated high- resolution multi-wavelengths observations. We aligned datasets from Solar Orbiter, SST, IRIS, and SDO. We re-projected the Solar Orbiter datasets to match the perspective of the Earth-based instruments. We performed potential field extrapolations from Solar Orbiter/PHI data. We analysed the spatial and temporal evolution of the plasma structures and their link with the surface magnetic field. This leads us to derive a model and scenario for the observed structures which we explain in a general schematic representation. We have discovered a new feature, a singularity in the chromospheric fibril pattern. It is formed in a weak magnetic field corridor between two flux concentrations of equal sign, at the base of a vertically inverted-Y shape field line pattern. In this specific case some activity develops along the structure. Firstly a flaring loop at one end, secondly a blow-out jet at the other end, where a coronal null-point was present and associated with a chromospheric saddle point being located onto the fibril singularity.

    "abstract": "The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations."

    "abstract": "Time series prediction algorithms are increasingly central to decision-making in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, energy management, and economic planning. Yet, these systems often inherit and amplify biases embedded in historical data, flawed problem specifications, and socio-technical design decisions. This paper critically examines the ethical foundations and mitigation strategies for algorithmic bias in time series prediction. We outline how predictive models, particularly in temporally dynamic domains, can reproduce structural inequalities and emergent discrimination through proxy variables and feedback loops. The paper advances a threefold contribution: First, it reframes algorithmic bias as a socio- technical phenomenon rooted in normative choices and institutional constraints. Second, it offers a structured diagnosis of bias sources across the pipeline, emphasizing the need for causal modeling, interpretable systems, and inclusive design practices. Third, it advocates for structural reforms that embed fairness through participatory governance, stakeholder engagement, and legally enforceable safeguards. Special attention is given to fairness validation in dynamic environments, proposing multi-metric, temporally-aware, and context- sensitive evaluation methods. Ultimately, we call for an integrated ethics-by-design approach that positions fairness not as a trade-off against performance, but as a co-requisite of responsible innovation. This framework is essential to developing predictive systems that are not only effective and adaptive but also aligned with democratic values and social equity."

Unlike previous approaches, our method is valid for arbitrary dispersion profiles, including resonances, and does not rely on the commonly used frame hopping approach, allowing treatment of multiple-velocity and accelerated systems. Applying this framework to canonical Drude and Lorentz media, we uncover a family of dispersion-mediated space-time states that arise from the multiple frequency transitions permitted by material dispersion. These states extend beyond conventional nondispersive scattering, revealing qualitatively new regimes of space-time scattering regimes. Our results establish a rigorous foundation for the design of realistic space-time metamaterials, with immediate relevance to emerging experiments in epsilon-near-zero optical platforms and open pathways for dispersion-engineered wave manipulation."

Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space."

    "abstract": "Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling."

In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms."

    "abstract": "Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation."

    "abstract": "Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

    "abstract": "The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries."

    "abstract": "The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training."

    "abstract": "We study the ferromagnetic instability in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice. Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries."

Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\\log_{10}(L_{\\mathrm{bol}})\\in [44.3, 47.5] \\mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date."

Bursts are clustered events that rapidly occur within shorter time periods, and they are separated by relatively longer inactive periods. The burst-tree decomposition method exactly maps the event sequence onto a tree, called a burst tree, in which each internal node represents a merge of consecutive bursts at the timescale separating those bursts. The burst tree fully reveals the hierarchical structure of bursts, hence the higher-order temporal correlations for the entire range of timescales. Those correlations are quantified using novel and existing measures derived from the burst tree, such as the burst complexity, memory coefficient for bursts, and principal and secondary cross sections of the burst-merging kernel. We apply our framework to the heartbeat time series of healthy people and of those with heart disease to reveal distinct multiscale temporal properties in physiological time series."

    "abstract": "As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods."

In this work, we present an intuitive and pedagogical framework to understand the origin of spin splitting in altermagnets. We identify two essential ingredients: (1) alternating spin-polarized wavefunction localization on sublattices, and (2) broken translational symmetry caused by distortions in non-magnetic ion cages. We discuss a minimal model Hamiltonian based on an atomic exchange-driven spin splitting and anisotropic hopping that captures these effects and reproduces the hallmark features of altermagnetic band structures, including nodal spin degeneracies and large spin splittings. Our model is further validated by ab initio calculations on MnF2. By demystifying the microscopic origins of altermagnetism, our work bridges symmetry analysis and material realizations, shedding light on practical designs of altermagnetic spintronic devices."

To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity.

We refine the hybrid model strategy, which was described in the earlier paper of this series, to model the emergence of the active region during 4 solar days starting shortly before 2011 February 11 and the eruption of an X2.2 flare on February 15. After 4 days of evolution, a major eruption of a magnetic flux rope occurs in the simulation at approximately 3 hours (3\\% difference) before the real flare. The eruption leads to magnetic reconnection that contributes to bulk heating in the chromosphere and corona. The deposition of flare energy in the chromosphere causes strong condensations and evaporations, which fill hot post-flare loops and bright flare ribbons that exhibit separation and extension similar to the observed ribbon evolution. The synthesized soft X-ray flux corresponds to X class, which is close to the real event. The upward eruption of the flux rope leads to a piston-driven shock and horizontal expansion that exerts a strong downward impact on the lower atmosphere and generate an apparently fast-propagating chromospheric Moreton wave. We conclude that the data-driven radiative simulation of this active region can reproduce the key observational results of the real flare and demonstrate the great potential of this method for studying solar eruptions in a realistic corona environment."

However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field. Extensive experiments under single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings demonstrate that IPTR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong generalization capability."

While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired \\{brain, speech, gesture\\} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \\textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \\textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results. Overall, we provide new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, thereby advancing our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science."

One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation.

Our work yields three key contributions: (1) a diagnostic benchmark for assessing RAG robustness, (2) an analytical framework for quantifying perturbation-temperature interactions, and (3) practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning under noisy retrieval conditions."

    "abstract": "We present a new holographic approach for generating large scale, polarization resolved optical tweezer arrays. By analyzing the ideal Jones fields that realize a target pattern, we identify that the fundamental degrees of freedom are the relative phases of the individual tweezers, rather than the full spatial phase profile. Leveraging this insight, we formulate a reverse projection optimization that adjusts only a small set of phase parameters to approximate the ideal operator within the physical constraints of a metasurface. This produces significantly higher fidelity and robustness than Gerchberg_Saxton type algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate H, V, L, and R polarized tweezer arrays using a single layer metasurface. A key advantage of our method is its phase stability, yielding strong resistance to optical aberrations and enabling coherent global phase modulation such as forming vortex tweezer lattice, without degrading trap quality. This framework provides a conceptually clear and experimentally powerful route for scalable optical field synthesis."

Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets. This benchmark is expected to facilitate model development and evaluation and enhance practitioners' understanding of the underlying mechanisms of models in the area of CTR prediction.

    "abstract": "The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation."

These frameworks now serve as a key mechanism for AI risk governance, utilized by regulations and governance instruments such as the EU AI Act's Code of Practice and California's Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act. Given their centrality to AI risk management, assessments of such frameworks are warranted. Existing assessments evaluate them at a high level of abstraction and lack granularity on specific practices for companies to adopt. We address this gap by developing a 65-criteria assessment methodology grounded in established risk management principles from safety-critical industries. We evaluate the twelve frameworks across four dimensions: risk identification, risk analysis and evaluation, risk treatment, and risk governance. Companies' current scores are low, ranging from 8% to 35%. By adopting existing best practices already in use across the frameworks, companies could reach 52%. The most critical gaps are nearly universal: companies generally fail to (a) define quantitative risk tolerances, (b) specify capability thresholds for pausing development, and (c) systematically identify unknown risks. To guide improvement, we provide specific recommendations for each company and each criterion."

    "abstract": "Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55°C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios."

In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting. The dynamic algorithm maintains an explainable clustering under a sequence of insertions and deletions, with amortized update time O(d log^3 k) and O(log k) recourse, making it suitable for large-scale and evolving datasets."

    "abstract": "Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context."

To validate its effectiveness, this paper presents a 4-dimensional implementation and introduces a new interaction design, termed `High-Dimensional FPS,' to enable intuitive high-dimensional exploration. Furthermore, as a case study to demonstrate the framework's high extensibility, I also integrated a non-rigid body physics simulation based on Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD). Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving real-time rendering (80 fps) of complex 4D objects and completing Boolean operations within seconds in a standard PC environment.

Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks.

    "abstract": "Natural systems are remarkably robust and resilient, maintaining essential functions despite variability, uncertainty, and hostile conditions. Understanding these nonlinear, dynamic behaviours is challenging because such systems involve many interacting parameters, yet it is crucial for explaining processes from cellular regulation to disease onset and epidemic spreading. Robustness and resilience describe a system's ability to preserve and recover desired behaviours in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations. This survey reviews how different disciplines define these concepts, examines methods for assessing whether key properties of uncertain, networked dynamical systems are structural (parameter-free) or robust (preserved for parameter variations within an uncertainty bounding set), and discusses integrated structural and probabilistic techniques for biological and epidemiological models. The text introduces formal definitions of resilience for families of systems obtained by adding stochastic perturbations to a nominal deterministic model, enabling a probabilistic characterisation of the ability to remain within or return to a prescribed attractor. These definitions generalise probabilistic robustness and shed new light on classical biological examples. In addition, the survey summarises resilience indicators and data-driven tools for detecting resilience loss and regime shifts, drawing on bifurcation analysis to anticipate qualitative changes in system behaviour. Together, these methodologies support the study and control of complex natural systems, guiding the design of biomolecular feedback architectures, the identification of therapeutic targets, the forecasting and management of epidemics, and the detection of tipping points in ecological and biological networks."

    "abstract": "Assessing risk of bias (RoB) in randomized controlled trials is essential for trustworthy evidence synthesis, but the process is resource-intensive and prone to variability across reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall. We also compared GEPA with three manually designed prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GEPA achieved the highest overall accuracy and improved performance by 30%-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting, and showed generally comparable, competitively aligned performance in the other domains relative to manual prompts. These findings suggest that GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting the structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis."

    "abstract": "As wireless communication networks rapidly evolve, spectrum resources are increasingly scarce, making effective spectrum management critically important. Radio map is a spatial representation of signal characteristics across different locations in a given area, which serves as a key tool for enabling precise spectrum management. To generate accurate radio maps, extensive research efforts have been made. However, most existing studies are conducted on simulation data, which differs significantly from real-world data and cannot accurately reflect the spectrum characteristics of practical environments. To tackle this problem, we construct a dataset of real-world radio map with a self-developed measurement system. Due to the limited volume of real-world data and the distributional discrepancies between simulation and real-world data, we propose a Pixel Transformer (PiT)- based model enhanced with the test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, named RadioPiT, for real-world radio map generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RadioPiT significantly outperforms baseline methods in real-world scenarios, yielding a 21.9% decrement in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared to RadioUNet."

    "abstract": "Clustering functional data is a challenging task due to intrinsic infinite-dimensionality and the need for stable, data-adaptive partitioning. In this work, we propose a clustering framework based on Random Projections, which simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and generates multiple stochastic representations of the original functions. Each projection is clustered independently, and the resulting partitions are then aggregated through an ensemble consensus procedure, enhancing robustness and mitigating the influence of any single projection. To focus on the most informative representations, projections are ranked according to clustering quality criteria, and only a selected subset is retained. In particular, we adopt Gaussian Mixture Models as base clusterers and employ the Kullback-Leibler divergence to order the random projections; these choices enable fast computation and eliminate the need to specify the number of clusters a priori. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed through an extensive simulation study and two real-data applications, one from spectroscopy data for food authentication and one from log-periodograms of speech recording; the obtained results suggest that the proposal represents an effective tool for the clustering of functional data."

    "abstract": "3D human avatar animation aims at transforming a human avatar from an arbitrary initial pose to a specified target pose using deformation algorithms. Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that our model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with an optimal balance between efficiency and quality,surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, phase transition of ITO may pose a substantial impact on display performances. Yet, a comprehensive colormap of ITO thin films as functions of annealing temperature and film thickness is missing. In this work, we systematically investigate properties of ITO films based on X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 °C) and thickness (5-100 nm) for the non-volatile color display, and we observe strong color changes under 250 °C annealing treatment for the 50-nm and 100-nm-thick ITO films. We suggest that the intrinsic change in colors of the ITO functional thin-film layers should also be taken into account, when the PCM-based reconfigurable color devices are used in practice."

In this work we define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose a new Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH) leveraging both transition time and duration-in-state, avoiding costly and distorting resampling on large databases. STH generalizes both resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics with better precision and computation time, and an ability to focus on multiple states of interest.

Theoretical guarantees are established for our constructions, showing that the procedure achieves optimality for $e$-values and for $p$-values under independence, and admissibility for $p$-values under general dependence. Empirical results from simulations and two real-world applications, including a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a clinical prediction task leveraging large language models (LLM), demonstrate that our framework improves statistical efficiency under fixed resource limits."

In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

    "abstract": "Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases."

    "abstract": "Acoustic helical dichroism (HD) arises from the interaction between vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and chiral media, yet such chiral sound-matter interactions are typically weak. Here, we employ quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs) in acoustic meta-cavities composed of coupled Helmholtz resonators to enhance acoustic HD. We design both achiral and chiral meta-cavities that support QBICs in the form of vortex states with high Q-factors. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the QBICs in the achiral meta-cavities cannot enhance acoustic HD due to the absence of a chiral wavefront. In contrast, the chiral meta-cavity exhibits a pronounced HD enhancement through the QBICs with a 3D helical wavefront, which can be excited by incident waves either with or without OAM. Our work identifies two essential requirements for enhancing acoustic HD effect via QBICs: a high Q-factor of the states and 3D chirality of the state fields, which usually compromise each other in conventional acoustic resonators. The findings open new avenues for achieving strong chiral sound-matter interactions, with potential applications in acoustic chiral sensing and acoustic OAM manipulation."

We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a power method for computing the dominant eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian dual quaternion matrix (DQM). Although the algorithmic framework parallels the Hermitian case, the theoretical analysis is substantially more complex since a non-Hermitian dual matrix may possess no eigenvalues or infinitely many eigenvalues. Besides, its eigenvalues are not necessarily dual numbers, leading to non-commutative behavior that further complicates the analysis. We first present a sufficient condition that ensures the existence of an eigenvalue whose standard part corresponds to the largest magnitude eigenvalue of the standard part matrix. Under a stronger condition, we then establish that the sequence generated by the power method converges linearly to the strict dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvectors. We also verify that this condition is necessary. The key to our analysis is a new Jordan-like decomposition, which addresses a gap arising from the lack of a conventional Jordan decomposition for non-Hermitian dual matrices. Our framework readily extends to non-Hermitian dual complex and dual number matrices. We also develop an adjoint method that reformulates the eigenvalue problem into an equivalent form for dual complex matrices. Numerical experiments on non-Hermitian DQMs are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the power method."

By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling. We furthermore obtain an exact relationship between the polaron interactions at fixed medium density and at fixed chemical potential, a result which is valid for arbitrary interaction strength. Our work provides an important guide for understanding experiments, and it acts as a starting point for future strong-coupling theories of polaron interactions that capture all of the effects identified in this work."

Such behavior is unconventional and suggests a depletion of the condensate by increasing pairbreaking or the growth of a second non-pairing channel. This led to a recent suggestion that the condensate arises from an incoherent charge channel which progressively gives way with overdoping to a second, coherent non-pairing channel. Contra these ideas, we report analysis of the field-dependent electronic specific heat of several cuprates from which we find no apparent loss of SFD with overdoping. The SFD per CuO_2 plaquette is found to rise progressively with overdoping from p towards (1+p), undiminished and much the same as the Hall number, thus implying that all available carriers contribute to the condensate. We suggest this could be the underlying intrinsic behavior for all cuprates. Our samples include (Y,Ca)Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-δ}, Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+δ}, La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 and Tl_2Ba_2CuO_6, with the latter being the only exception.

Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge. IPI is, thus, shown to be a powerful optical technology for characterizing ice particles down to a few micrometers in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, DDA is a versatile method for such synthetic experiments and can further supply large datasets for development of various inversion methods."

As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects. Experimental results show that our metric correlates well with human perceptions and outperforms existing methods, and has good generalizability."

    "abstract": "Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance."

We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, by incorporating replay buffer and continual backpropagate methods into DEM, we provide evidence of achieving better trade-off between exploitation and exploration in continuous learning settings. We conducted experiments on four different datasets for children with cochlear implants whose spoken language developmental outcomes vary considerably on the individual-child level. Preoperative neural MRI data has shown to accurately predict the post-operative outcome of these children within but not across datasets.

    "abstract": "Code review is critical for ensuring software quality and maintainability. With the rapid growth in software scale and complexity, code review has become a bottleneck in the development process because of its time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature and the shortage of experienced developers willing to review code. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating code reviews based on retrieval, neural machine translation, pre-trained models, or large language models (LLMs). These approaches mainly leverage historical code changes and review comments. However, a large amount of crucial information for code review, such as the context of code changes and prior review knowledge, has been overlooked. This paper proposes an LLM-based review knowledge-augmented, context-aware framework for code review generation, named LAURA. The framework integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance the performance of ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3 in generating code review comments. Besides, given the extensive low-quality reviews in existing datasets, we also constructed a high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that for both models, LAURA generates review comments that are either completely correct or at least helpful to developers in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases, respectively, significantly outperforming SOTA baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies demonstrate that all components of LAURA contribute positively to improving comment quality."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Existing approaches overwhelmingly operate within the prompt-optimization paradigm: whether through traditional algorithmic search or recent agent-based workflows, the resulting prompts typically retain malicious semantic signals that modern guardrails are primed to detect. In contrast, we identify a deeper, largely overlooked vulnerability stemming from the highly interconnected nature of an LLM's internal knowledge. This structure allows harmful objectives to be realized by weaving together sequences of benign sub-queries, each of which individually evades detection. To exploit this loophole, we introduce the Correlated Knowledge Attack Agent (CKA-Agent), a dynamic framework that reframes jailbreaking as an adaptive, tree-structured exploration of the target model's knowledge base. The CKA-Agent issues locally innocuous queries, uses model responses to guide exploration across multiple paths, and ultimately assembles the aggregated information to achieve the original harmful objective. Evaluated across state-of-the-art commercial LLMs (Gemini2.5-Flash/Pro, GPT-oss-120B, Claude-Haiku-4.5), CKA-Agent consistently achieves over 95% success rates even against strong guardrails, underscoring the severity of this vulnerability and the urgent need for defenses against such knowledge-decomposition attacks.

In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning."

Exploiting this interaction-enabled BIDC, we show that (i) a distant, four-atom entangled state can be prepared with high fidelity, and (ii) quantum entangled states can be coherently transferred between spatially separated nodes. Our results establish a scalable mechanism for multi-particle state generation and routing in waveguide platforms, opening a route to interaction-protected quantum communication with many-particle BICs."

However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity."

This article focuses on the task of LLMs scoring journal articles for research quality on a four-point scale, testing how user prompt design can enhance this ability. Based primarily on 1.7 million Gemma3 27b queries for 2780 health and life science articles with 58 similar prompts, the results show that improvements can be obtained by (a) testing semantically equivalent prompt variations, (b) averaging scores from semantically equivalent prompts, (c) specifying that fractional scores are allowed, and possibly also (d) not drawing attention to the input being partial. Whilst (a) and (d) suggests that models can be sensitive to how a task is phrased, (b) and (c) suggest that strategies to leverage more of the model's knowledge are helpful, such as by perturbing prompts and facilitating fractions. Perhaps counterintuitively, encouraging incorrect answers (fractions for this task) releases useful information about the model's certainty about its answers. Mixing semantically equivalent prompts also reduces the chance of getting no score for an input. Additional testing showed that the best prompts vary between LLMs, however, and were almost the opposite for ChatGPT 4o-mini, weakly aligned for Llama4 Scout and Magistral, and made little difference to Qwen3 32b and DeepSeek R1 32b. Overall, whilst there is no single best prompt, a good strategy for all models was to average the scores from a range of different semantically equivalent or similar prompts."

To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix. Our AC-PMBR decoding improved approximation errors of matrix completion by up to 3 times and achieved higher translation quality compared with PMBR decoding at a comparable computational cost on the WMT'23 En$\\leftrightarrow$De translation tasks."

However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment.

    "abstract": "Temporal Action Localization (TAL) remains a fundamental challenge in video understanding, aiming to identify the start time, end time, and category of all action instances within untrimmed videos. While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or \"fuzzy\" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden.

In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality.

To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\\% additional storage per task.

    "abstract": "Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \\emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \\emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \\emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier."

    "abstract": "Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks."

    "abstract": "MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm."

    "abstract": "Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\\mathrm{eff} = \\, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories."

However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\\% and reduces collisions by 54\\%."

    "abstract": "Humans are increasingly forming parasocial relationships with AI systems, and modern AI shows an increasing tendency to display social and relationship-seeking behaviour. However, the psychological consequences of this trend are unknown. Here, we combined longitudinal randomised controlled trials (N=3,532) with a neural steering vector approach to precisely manipulate human exposure to relationship-seeking AI models over time. Dependence on a stimulus or activity can emerge under repeated exposure when \"liking\" (how engaging or pleasurable an experience may be) decouples from \"wanting\" (a desire to seek or continue it). We found evidence that this decoupling emerged over four weeks of exposure. Relationship-seeking AI had immediate but declining hedonic appeal, yet triggered growing markers of attachment and increased intentions to seek future AI companionship. The psychological impacts of AI followed non-linear dose-response curves, with moderately relationship-seeking AI maximising hedonic appeal and attachment. Despite signs of persistent \"wanting\", extensive AI use over a month conferred no discernible benefit to psychosocial health. These behavioural changes were accompanied by shifts in how users relate to and understand artificial intelligence: users viewed relationship-seeking AI relatively more like a friend than a tool and their beliefs on AI consciousness in general were shifted after a month of exposure. These findings offer early signals that AI optimised for immediate appeal may create self-reinforcing cycles of demand, mimicking human relationships but failing to confer the nourishment that they normally offer."

Using a perturbative treatment for weak anisotropy, we demonstrate that although the characteristic $t^{1/3}$ drop growth law remains unchanged, the anisotropy causes a significant breakdown of morphological universality. Specifically, we calculate explicitly a one-parameter family of nonequilibrium drop shapes that depend on the scaled drop size. These shapes are close to the equilibrium Wulff shape, but the smaller drops are more spherical and the larger drops have an enhanced anisotropy in comparison to the Wulff shape. We also demonstrate that the the drop size distribution is modified from the isotropic LS distribution at second order in the anisotropy strength."

However, the efficiency of mineral processing is severely limited by uncertainty, which arises from both the variability of feedstock and the complexity of process dynamics. To optimize mineral processing circuits under uncertainty, we introduce an AI-driven approach that formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in handling both feedstock uncertainty and process model uncertainty to optimize the operation of a simulated, simplified flotation cell as an example. We show that by integrating the process of information gathering (i.e., uncertainty reduction) and process optimization, this approach has the potential to consistently perform better than traditional approaches at maximizing an overall objective, such as net present value (NPV). Our methodological demonstration of this optimization-under-uncertainty approach for a synthetic case provides a mathematical and computational framework for later real-world application, with the potential to improve both the laboratory-scale design of experiments and industrial-scale operation of mineral processing circuits without any additional hardware."

In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks. Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding.To address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data. Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios."

It is found that neutrinos can acquire masses not only from the usual light quark loop corrections but also from the light quark condensates. The latter contribution has been overlooked in the literature. We show that both contributions are comparable for operators involving $u$ and $d$ quarks, while quark loop corrections dominate for operators involving the $s$ quark. Using the low-energy effective field theory extended with light right-handed neutrinos and matching to chiral perturbation theory, we systematically analyze these contributions, deriving constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients from neutrino mass bounds, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and light pseudoscalar meson invisible decays. Our analysis shows that electron neutrino mass measurements provide the most stringent constraints on these scalar couplings, significantly improving upon limits from other observables. The results highlight the importance of including both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions in complete phenomenological analyses of neutrino mass generation mechanisms."

This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead."

The particle positions are recorded to identify when a predefined region near the wall is empty, allowing the piston to compress the colloidal suspension without applying work on the system. We find that the stored compression energy is universally set by the probability of a positive measurement outcome, which in turn is controlled by parameters such as density and compression step size. We further demonstrate that mechanical work can be extracted during the decompression of the piston, thereby closing the engine's operating cycle."

We establish conditions under which these invariants remain unchanged under bi-Lipschitz equivalence. In particular, we prove a special case of the metric version of Zariski multiplicity conjecture. We show that multiplicity is preserved when the ideal coincides with the integral closure of its order ideal. We also provide a partial answer to the open question of whether the local Euler obstruction is a bi-Lipschitz invariant. For hypersurfaces with isolated singularities, we show that the Euler obstruction is preserved under non-degeneracy conditions.

A 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam was incident on an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target, and the scattered electron and produced meson were detected in two magnetic focusing spectrometers, enabling precision cross section measurements. The cross section ratio $σ_{LT'}/σ_0$ was extracted from the beam-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}$. The $t$-dependence of $σ_{LT'}/σ_0$ was determined at fixed $Q^2$ and $x_B$ over a range of kinematics from $2<Q^2<6$ GeV$^2$ above the resonance region ($W>2$ GeV). Furthermore, these data are combined with recent results from CLAS/CLAS12 to determine the $Q^2$-dependence of $σ_{LT'}/σ_0$ at two ($x_B$, $t$) settings. This was fairly flat, with $Q^2$ not having a measurable effect on the value of $σ_{LT'}/σ_0$ in the range explored. Results are compared to predictions from the generalized parton distribution (GPD) formalism, which relies explicitly on hard/soft factorization, and Regge formalism. The Regge models better predict $σ_{LT'}/σ_0$, which suggests that the factorization regime is not yet reached."

A preliminary TTV analysis suggests that the observed variations could be caused by gravitational perturbations from planet c; however, reproducing the observed amplitudes requires a relatively high eccentricity of about 0.3 for planet c. Our dynamical stability analysis indicates that such a configuration is dynamically viable and places a $1σ$ upper limit on the mass of TOI-6041c at $0.8\\,M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. An alternative is the presence of a third, low-mass planet located between planets b and c, or on an inner orbit relative to planet b -- particularly near a mean-motion resonance with planet b -- which could account for the observed variations. These findings remain tentative, and further RV and photometric observations are essential to better constrain the mass of planet b and to refine the TTV modeling, thereby improving our understanding of the system's dynamical architecture."

    "abstract": "We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems."

    "abstract": "Chess, a deterministic game with perfect information, has long served as a benchmark for studying strategic decision-making and artificial intelligence. Traditional chess engines or tools for analysis primarily focus on calculating optimal moves, often neglecting the variability inherent in human chess playing, particularly across different skill levels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel and computationally efficient move prediction framework that approaches chess move prediction as a behavioral analysis task. The framework employs n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific player skill levels. By dividing players into seven distinct skill groups, from novice to expert, we trained separate models using data from the open-source chess platform Lichess. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks and generates player moves based on preceding sequences. Evaluation on real-world game data demonstrates that the model selector module within the framework can classify skill levels with an accuracy of up to 31.7\\% when utilizing early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework also shows substantial accuracy improvements, with our Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1\\% more accurate than our benchmark accuracy. The computational efficiency of the framework further enhances its suitability for real-time chess analysis."

For this, we extend the notion of universal inputs to incorporate prior knowledge on the system. An input is called universal for identification (resp., stabilization) if, when applied to any system complying with the prior knowledge, it results in data suitable for identification (resp., stabilization) regardless of the initial condition. We provide a full characterization of such universal inputs. In addition, we discuss online experiment design using prior knowledge, and we study cases where this approach results in the shortest possible experiment for identification and stabilization."

Their interfacial behavior governs energy storage and electrochemical processes. Despite their importance, the thermodynamics of even simple models -- such as the charged Lennard-Jones fluid -- remain underexplored in this regime. We present an extended Wang-Landau sampling approach to efficiently compute the density of states of charged mixtures with respect to the particle number. The method supports simulations in both bulk and confined geometries. Combined with the Constant Potential Method, it also enables to study effects due to confining electrodes. We employ this approach to study symmetric, binary mixtures of charged Lennard-Jones particles -- the modified Restricted Primitive Model -- in bulk, in inert confinement, and in conductive confinement at the potential of zero charge. Our results show that confinement shifts the vapor-liquid critical point to lower temperatures and higher densities compared to bulk, in line with the classical concept of capillary condensation. Importantly, conductive boundaries significantly lower the chemical potential of coexistence relative to inert confinement. These findings offer deeper insight into the phase behavior of ionic fluids in energy-relevant porous environments."

In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $α$ and the variable selection ratio $ρ$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = αN$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = ρN$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $ρN$ dimensions can separate $αN$ random patterns if and only if $α< 2ρ$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings."

In this paper, we give an induced counterpart of the Forest Minor theorem: for any $t \\geqslant 2$, the $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free $H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded pathwidth if and only if $H$ belongs to a class $\\mathcal F$ of forests, which we describe as the induced minors of two (very similar) infinite parameterized families.

We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework.

On ultra-large graphs with up to N=20,000 nodes and 295 million edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential."

However, in regions with complex topography, Euclidean distance poorly approximates functional accessibility, causing misallocations that undermine efficiency and equity. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to quantify misallocation risk by modeling travel distances as random scaling of Euclidean distances and deriving incorrect assignment probability as a function of local Voronoi geometry. Using plant-municipality observations (n=383) in Extremadura, Spain (41,635 km2), we demonstrate that the Log-Normal distribution provides best relative fit among alternatives (K-S statistic=0.110). Validation reveals 15.4% of municipalities are misallocated, consistent with the theoretical prediction interval (52-65 municipalities at 95% confidence). Our framework achieves 95% agreement with complex spatial models at O(n) complexity. Poor absolute fit of global distributions (p-values<0.01) reflects diverse topography (elevation 200-2,400m), motivating spatial stratification. Sensitivity analysis validates the fitted dispersion parameter (s=0.093) for predicting observed misallocation. We provide a calibration protocol requiring only 30-100 pilot samples per zone, enabling rapid risk assessment without full network analysis. This establishes the first probabilistic framework for Voronoi misallocation risk with practical guidelines emphasizing spatial heterogeneity and context-dependent calibration."

Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. However, traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints.

    "abstract": "We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning. Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $ε$ using only $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}ε)$ label queries and incurs at most $\\tilde{O}(d \\ln \\frac{1}ε)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\\tildeΩ(ε)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21]."

    "abstract": "Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a prominent technique for certifying the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii. Additionally, the dual RS framework naturally provides a routing perspective for certified robustness, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off with off-the-shelf expert RS models."

Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis."

The continuity inequality for conditional entropy $H(A|B)$, called the Alicki-Fannes-Winter (AWF) inequality, shows that if the states are close in trace-distance, then the conditional entropies are also close. Having the AWF inequality for conditional entropy, we show that the channel entropy defined through the relative entropy is continuous with respect to the diamond-distance between channels. Inspired by this, similar continuity inequalities for the Rényi conditional entropy $\\widetilde{H}^\\uparrow_α$ were obtained in the work [A. Marwah and F. Dupuis, J. Math. Phys. 63, 052201 (2022)]. We provide continuity bounds for the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis conditional entropies $\\widetilde{H}^\\downarrow_α(A|B)_ρ, \\widetilde{T}^\\downarrow_α(A|B)_ρ$ for states with the same marginal on the conditioning system. Similar to the previous bounds, our bound depends only on the dimension of the conditioning system. We apply this result to prove continuity of the channel entropy for Rényi and Tsallis channel entropies defined through the sandwiched Rényi and Tsallis relative entropies."

The MoTe$_2$ semimetal with distorted orthorhombic crystal structure in the 1T$'$ phase has gathered particular attention due to its high spin-orbit coupling and reconfigurability as a type-II Weyl semimetal close to room temperature. Here, we report on the role of chemically grown 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ thin films in inducing SCC in 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/FM heterostructures as measured at room temperature. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and electrically detected spin-pumping FMR measurements performed on 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/Co/Au and 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$/Au/Co/Au heterostructures reveal a spin-mixing conductance value of up to $\\sim1.6 \\times 10^{20}~\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ and a spin Hall angle of $1.7\\%$. These findings position MoTe$_2$ thin films as a competitive spin-charge conversion option compared to other functional materials (e.g., heavy metals, topological insulators), highlighting their potential for future applications in spintronic devices."

We compare an f/10 linearly polarized laser beam with two radially polarized cases: one focused more tightly (f/5) to match peak intensity, and one at equal f/10 to capture polarization effects. The radially polarized f/10 case injects approximately one-third more charge than the linearly polarized case, while the f/5 radially polarized case outperforms the linearly polarized one by about a factor of two in terms of maximum electron energy. These results highlight polarization and focusing geometry as key parameters for optimizing laser-driven electron acceleration setups."

We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor."

We performed simulations compatible with the experimental conditions of the MAMI (University of Mainz) and CLAS (Jefferson Lab) facilities. We have computed cross sections and evaluated the main backgrounds. MAMI is a three-spectrometer system with extremely good energy resolution and small acceptances. We found that, by choosing specific values of the final particle's momenta, the shell structure can be well resolved, with negligible background contributions. CLAS is a large solid angle detector with poorer energy resolution. In both cases, the background can be kept under control by performing cuts in missing energy and missing momentum; however, in CLAS, the shell structure cannot be resolved due to the energy resolution. We conclude that MAMI is particularly appropriate for the proposed experiment, whereas CLAS is better suited for other studies."

When applied to isotropic media, the results are verified to be consistent with those obtained using an optical (Gordon) metric. The potential of this method to model light rays in anisotropic media is finally demonstrated by considering waves in a nonuniformly moving magnetized plasma, exposing how nonuniform motion and anisotropy can compete with one another."

While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding."

    "abstract": "The dynamic interplay between light and electric field control of charge states lies at the heart of developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices. While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices."

Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we introduce an optimization-free approach for the automated generation of self-organized freeform waveguides that adapt to complex propagation paths. Our method relies on local reaction-diffusion dynamics to produce robust, spatially distributed structures. In contrast to conventional waveguides based on periodic media, which impose strong geometric constraints and require extensive fine-tuning, the proposed structures support nontrivial geometries while maintaining photonic band gap behavior. We experimentally demonstrate that these self-organized waveguides achieve superior transmission efficiency along complex paths. This optimization-free strategy enables the automated design of advanced electromagnetic components with intrinsic adaptability and resilience."

Using the formulas for perturbation reconstruction, we translate the PFV condition into boundary conditions on the master functions: Dirichlet-type for odd-parity modes and Robin-type for even-parity modes. With these boundary conditions, we compute the quasinormal frequencies of RN-AdS black holes and identify new spectral features. The PFV prescription introduced here could be applied to other multifield perturbation systems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes."

For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z>2.5$), the median radial profile of $Σ_{\\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $Σ_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z>2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z<2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts."

    "abstract": "Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone."

However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness."

To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples.

    "abstract": "The temperature-dependence of dynamical properties (e.g., the asymptotic diffusion coefficient and the sub-diffusive exponent) are calculated for charges and excitons in one-dimensional systems subject to static and dynamic disorder. These properties are determined by three complementary methods. One approach is via the time-integration of the velocity autocorrelation function. The second is via the mean-squared-displacement of thermal wavepackets subject to stochastic collapse via Lindblad jump operators. These two methods are applicable in the high-temperature regime, where the noise is temporally uncorrelated. In this regime the noise causes particle localization and the transport is diffusive. The third approach -- applicable in the low-temperature regime -- is weak-coupling Redfield theory. Here, static disorder causes particle localization. When the dynamics is diffusive, the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of temperature, increasing with temperature in the low-temperature Environment Assisted Quantum Transport regime and decreasing with temperature in the high-temperature quantum-Zeno regime. For any temperature, static and dynamic disorder decreases the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics is non-diffusive for thermal energies deep within the manifold of local-ground-states, where the sub-diffusive exponent decreases with increasing disorder and decreasing temperature."

    "abstract": "Microscale turbulence drives not only particle and heat transport but also energy exchange between different particle species. Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating. In this work, we extend these studies by examining the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles at a steady state using the one-dimensional transport solver GOTRESS. For the case of DIII-D discharge 128913 [A. E. White et al., Phys. Plasmas 15, 056116 (2008)], turbulent energy exchange has minimal influence on temperature profiles. However, in the case of enhanced electron heating in a DIIID like tokamak plasma, energy transfer from hot electrons to cold ions driven by TEM turbulence becomes comparable to, or even exceeds, the collisional contribution, leading to a significant increase in the ion temperature profile. For ITER Baseline and SPARC standard H-mode scenarios [N.T. Howard et al., Nucl. Fusion 65, 016002(2024), P. Rodriguez Fernandez et al., J. Plasma Phys. 86, 865860503(2020)], the turbulent energy exchange is largely compensated by the collisional one, producing only small effects. These results indicate that the impact of turbulent energy exchange on the global temperature profiles in steady state conditions of future fusion reactor scenarios is expected to be negligibly small, although it can become significant in situations such as plasma start up phases, where the heating power is strongly unbalanced between electrons and ions."

By employing lightweight MPI primitives, reductions in communication latency are achieved, facilitating more efficient data exchanges across distributed fuzzing nodes. Experimental results obtained over standard benchmarks demonstrate enhanced coverage progression from the early stages of the fuzzing process, which could be beneficial if fuzzing is employed in CI/CD pipelines at any stage of software development. Furthermore, the coordinated exchange of input corpora among clusters of fuzzers effectively addresses coverage stagnation, enabling a sustained exploration of complex and deep execution paths.

Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations."

Using Bondi Sachs expansions, we identify the independent radiative data and derive the effective Bondi mass aspect, whose balance law receives an additional positive definite flux from the vector sector. This leads to modified displacement, spin, and center of mass memory (CM) expressions, where the gravitational contributions retain their General Relativity (GR) form and the vector field enters only through well defined flux terms. We also describe persistent vector memory effects associated with the leading angular vector mode, which are gauge invariant but do not affect the leading tidal observables. The BMS transformations act kinematically as in GR. Tensor vacua remain supertranslation degenerate, whereas the vector vacuum, defined by the vanishing vector field, is nondegenerate. All results reduce continuously to GR when the coupling is removed, isolating the precise channels through which vector curvature interactions modify the infrared dynamics."

However, related fraud activities, especially phishing scams, have caused significant property losses. There are many graph analysis methods to detect malicious scam incidents, but no research on the transaction patterns of the NFT scams. Therefore, to fill this gap, we are the first to systematically explore NFT phishing frauds through graph analysis, aiming to comprehensively investigate the characteristics and patterns of NFT phishing frauds on the transaction graph. During the research process, we collect transaction records, log data, and security reports related to NFT phishing incidents published on multiple platforms. After collecting, sanitizing, and unifying the data, we construct a transaction graph and analyze the distribution, transaction features, and interaction patterns of NFT phishing scams. We find that normal transactions on the blockchain accounted for 96.71% of all transactions. Although phishing-related accounts accounted for only 0.94% of the total accounts, they appeared in 8.36% of the transaction scenarios, and their interaction probability with normal accounts is significantly higher in large-scale transaction networks. Moreover, NFT phishing scammers often carry out fraud in a collective manner, targeting specific accounts, tend to interact with victims through multiple token standards, have shorter transaction cycles than normal transactions, and involve more multi-party transactions. This study reveals the core behavioral features of NFT phishing scams, providing important references for the detection and prevention of NFT phishing scams in the future."

    "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) is an essential cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving applications, enabling a client to retrieve a record from a server's database without revealing which record was requested. Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading the entirety of large databases from storage, such as SSDs, severely limits its performance. To address this, we propose IVE, an accelerator for single-server PIR with a systematic extension that enables practical retrieval from large databases using DRAM. Recent advances in DRAM capacity allow PIR for large databases to be served entirely from DRAM, removing its dependence on storage bandwidth. Although the memory bandwidth bottleneck still remains, multi-client batching effectively amortizes database access costs across concurrent requests to improve throughput. However, client-specific data remains a bottleneck, whose bandwidth requirements ultimately limits performance. IVE overcomes this by employing a large on-chip scratchpad with an operation scheduling algorithm that maximizes data reuse, further boosting throughput. Additionally, we introduce sysNTTU, a versatile functional unit that enhances area efficiency without sacrificing performance. We also propose a heterogeneous memory system architecture, which enables a linear scaling of database sizes without a throughput degradation. Consequently, IVE achieves up to 1,275x higher throughput compared to prior PIR hardware solutions."

We investigate this phenomenon at order $α'^3$ in type IIA string theory. By computing the circular reduction of the one-loop Chern-Simons term and pure-gravity couplings in type IIA theory and applying the T-duality transformation to the resulting couplings, we derive their counterparts in the type IIB effective action. We demonstrate that the resulting nine-dimensional type IIB couplings are invariant under S-duality without requiring contributions from the tree-level effective action or non-perturbative effects. This result is non-trivial: while S-duality forbids one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in ten-dimensional type IIB theory, we show that the one-loop Chern-Simons couplings in nine dimensions, derived from the T-duality of type IIA, are S-duality invariant. As a consistency check, we show that the nine-dimensional type IIB couplings, when reduced on a K3 surface, reproduce the known heterotic string couplings on \\( T^5 \\) at order \\( α' \\), via the duality between the two theories."

Given the known quality and reliability issues connected with LLM-generated text, their potential growth poses an increasing problem for research integrity, and for public trust in research. This study presents a simple and easily reproducible methodology to show the growth in the full text of published papers, across the full range of research, as indexed in the Dimensions database. It uses this to demonstrate that LLM tools are likely to have been involved in the production of more than 10% of all published papers in 2024, based on disproportionate use of specific indicative words, and draws together earlier studies to confirm that this is a plausible overall estimate. It then discusses the implications of this for the integrity of scholarly publishing, highlighting evidence that use of LLMs for text generation is still being concealed or downplayed by authors, and presents an argument that more comprehensive disclosure requirements are urgently required to address this."

Rather than training neural networks to learn complete trajectories from scratch, we introduce Neural Network Perturbation Theory (NNPT), where networks predict only residual perturbations after analytically subtracting known exact solutions. We validate this framework through systematic comparison: using identical 2x32 architectures, correction learning achieves 28-54x lower validation error compared to networks trained on complete trajectories. Using the gravitational three-body problem as a test bed, we investigate capacity transitions in fixed-architecture multilayer perceptrons as Jovian mass varies from 0.05 to 30 times its physical value. An equalized-accuracy protocol reveals that both minimal network capacity and training time exhibit sharp transitions at f_c = 15.6+-1.0, where the system enters a strongly chaotic regime. At this transition, minimal capacity jumps approximately sevenfold from ~1,200 to ~8,600 parameters (architectures 2x32 and 3x64). Preliminary exploration of sequential two-stage corrections suggests that first-stage networks already capture dominant perturbative features. Our symplectic integrator maintains relative energy conservation below 2x10^-7 throughout, confirming that transitions reflect physical complexity rather than numerical error. Our results establish correction learning as a general strategy for parameter-efficient surrogates and demonstrate that physical complexity imposes fundamental capacity barriers on fixed-architecture networks at chaos onset."

Understanding its mass-loss processes and circumstellar environment offers insight into the late stages of stellar evolution in massive binary systems. Methods: We obtained high-angular--resolution, high-contrast imaging using VLT/SPHERE with ZIMPOL (optical) and IRDIS (near-infrared) across multiple filters. We used aperture photometry to extract the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each star, and applied radiative transfer modelling to study the system and its surrounding dusty environment. Results: The observations resolve both components of the binary and unveil a complex, dusty nebula featuring asymmetric structures and cavities. SED fitting yields stellar temperatures of T$_1 = 6723\\pm196$ K and T$_2 = 3394\\pm264$ K, along with bolometric luminosities of L$_1 = (7.9 \\pm 0.18) \\times 10^4$ L$_\\odot$ and L$_2 = (3.8 \\pm 0.11) \\times 10^4$ L$_\\odot$. These values support the classification of the primary as being in a post-red supergiant (post-RSG) phase and the secondary as an active red supergiant (RSG). The luminosity ratio, combined with the inferred radii, indicates that both stars are at close yet distinct stages of their evolution. The binary is surrounded by an extended shell whose asymmetric morphology and large-scale features suggest interaction with the stellar winds and interstellar medium (ISM), and possibly the presence of a third, undetected companion. Conclusions: These observations provide the first resolved view of AFGL 4106's system and its dusty envelope. Our analysis sets constraints on the physical properties and evolutionary status of the system.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

The model is formulated as a delayed-coupled hyperbolic system for bubble amplitude interactions. We combine time-domain integral equations, Laplace transforms, and Hardy-Sobolev space techniques to analyze this system, establishing its unique solvability in anisotropic Hilbert spaces, with solutions expressed as convergent Neumann series of convolution operators. We derive geometric decay of truncation errors for resonant incident waves and quantify the contribution of $N$-th order multi-scattering, showing it scales with \\(\\varepsilon^{N(1-p)+1}\\) (relating bubble radius \\(\\varepsilon\\) and inter-bubble distance scaling as $\\varepsilon^p$, $p<1$). This dominates the measurement errors, which are of order $\\varepsilon^2$, thereby allowing us to capture fields generated by inter-bubble interactions of order $N<\\frac{1}{1-p}$. This provides a quantitative relation between the spectra band width of the source field, the closeness distance between the bubbles and the order $N$ of the relevant interactions between the bubbles. Furthermore, a novel connection to Feynman diagrams maps multi-scattering paths to diagrammatic vertices and propagators, simplifying the interpretation of higher-order interactions and kinematic constraints. This framework advances accurate transient wave prediction in dispersive media, with implications for cavitation therapy, seismic imaging, and metamaterial engineering."

Despite these advantages and reported optimized morphologies, device efficiencies remain below 10%, far from their ideal radiative limit. To uncover the origin of these performance losses, we present a systematic and fully consistent first-principles investigation of the defect chemistry across the Bi-based chalcohalide family. Our results reveal a complex defect landscape dominated by chalcogen vacancies of low formation energy, which act as deep nonradiative recombination centers. Despite their moderate charge-carrier capture coefficients, the high equilibrium concentrations of these defects reduce the theoretical maximum efficiencies by 6% in BiSeI and by 10% in BiSeBr. In contrast, sulfur vacancies in BiSI and BiSBr are comparatively benign, presenting smaller capture coefficients due to weaker electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, despite its huge nonradiative charge-carrier recombination rate, BiSeI presents the best conversion efficiency among all four compounds owing to its most suitable bandgap for outdoor photovoltaic applications. Our findings identify defect chemistry as a critical bottleneck in MChX solar cells and proposes chalcogen-rich synthesis conditions and targeted anion substitutions as effective strategies for mitigation of detrimental vacancies."

Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey."

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider learning-based applications in routing to solve a Vehicle Routing variant characterized by stochasticity and multiple objectives. Such problems are representative of practical settings where decision-makers have to deal with uncertainty in the operational environment as well as multiple conflicting objectives due to different stakeholders. We specifically consider travel time uncertainty. We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated. Learning-based methods offer earnest computational advantages as they can repeatedly solve problems with limited interference from the decision-maker. We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories. These models have seen several successful applications in routing problems. However, since travel times are not a direct input to these models due to the large dimensions of the travel time matrix, accounting for uncertainty is a challenge, especially in the presence of multiple objectives. In turn, we propose a model that simultaneously addresses stochasticity and multi-objectivity and provide a refined training mechanism for this model through scenario clustering to reduce training time. Our results show that our model is capable of constructing a Pareto Front of good quality within acceptable run times compared to three baselines."

In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation."

    "abstract": "Environmental exposures, such as air pollution and extreme temperatures, have complex effects on human health. These effects are often characterized by non-linear exposure-lag-response relationships and delayed impacts over time. Accurately capturing these dynamics is crucial for informing public health interventions. The Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM) is a flexible statistical framework for estimating such effects in epidemiological research. However, standard DLNM implementations typically assume a homogeneous exposure-lag-response association across the study region, overlooking potential spatial heterogeneity, which can lead to biased risk estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce DLNM-Clust: a novel mixture of DLNMs that extends the traditional DLNM. Within a Bayesian framework, DLNM-Clust probabilistically assigns each geographic unit to one of $C$ latent spatial clusters, each of which is defined by a distinct DLNM specification. This approach allows capturing both common patterns and singular deviations in the exposure-lag-response surface. We demonstrate the method using municipality-level time-series data on the relationship between air pollution and the incidence of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our results emphasize the importance of spatially aware modeling strategies in environmental epidemiology, facilitating region-specific risk assessment and supporting the development of targeted public health initiatives."

Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone."

Building on this, we introduce a model that learns a deformation of the parameter space, enabling rapid posterior sampling without requiring iterative methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive posterior approximations with improved scalability compared to recent refinement techniques.

In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Heuristic methods often illustrate the strongest results with high scalability, while learning-based methods maintain nearly constant inference time as the network size and density grow."

In this paper, we consider the way DuckDB interacts with local storage. Our long term research question is whether and how SSDs could be co-designed with DuckDB. As a first step towards vertical integration of DuckDB and programmable SSDs, we consider whether and how DuckDB can access NVMe SSDs directly. By default, DuckDB relies on the POSIX file interface. In contrast, we rely on the xNVMe library and explore how it can be leveraged in DuckDB. We leverage the block-based nature of the DuckDB buffer manager to bypass the synchronous POSIX I/O interface, the file system and the block manager. Instead, we directly issue asynchronous I/Os against the SSD logical block address space. Our preliminary experimental study compares different ways to manage asynchronous I/Os atop xNVMe. The speed-up we observe over the DuckDB baseline is significant, even for the simplest scan query over a TPC-H table. As expected, the speed-up increases with the scale factor, and the Linux NVMe passthru improves performance. Future work includes a more thorough experimental study, a flexible solution that combines raw NVMe access and legacy POSIX file interface as well the co-design of DuckDB and SSDs."

Here, we investigate, for the case of homogeneous ice nucleation, whether the nucleus size exhibits Markovian dynamics, as assumed in classical nucleation theory. Using 300 independent nucleation trajectories generated by molecular dynamics, we evaluate the mean recurrence time required to reach selected values of the largest nucleus size. Early recurrences consistently take longer than later ones, revealing a clear history dependence and thus non-Markovian dynamics. To identify the slow modes underlying this behaviour, we analyse several structural descriptors of the nucleus, observing subtle but systematic differences between nuclei at early and late recurrences. By training a neural network on 2,700 short trajectories to learn the committor, we identify relevant collective variables. Based on these features, symbolic regression provides a compact approximation of the committor, i.e., an improved reaction coordinate, which we subsequently test for Markovianity."

    "abstract": "In audio signal processing applications with a microphone and a loudspeaker within the same acoustic environment, the loudspeaker signals can feed back into the microphone, thereby creating a closed-loop system that potentially leads to system instability. To remove this acoustic coupling, prediction error method (PEM) feedback cancellation algorithms aim to identify the feedback path between the loudspeaker and the microphone by assuming that the input signal can be modelled by means of an autoregressive (AR) model. It has previously been shown that this PEM framework and resulting algorithms can identify the feedback path correctly in cases where the forward path from microphone to loudspeaker is sufficiently time-varying or non-linear, or when the forward path delay equals or exceeds the order of the AR model. In this paper, it is shown that this delay-based condition can be generalised for one particular PEM-based algorithm, the so-called two-channel adaptive feedback canceller (2ch-AFC), to an invertibility-based condition, for which it is shown that identifiability can be achieved when the order of the forward path feedforward filter exceeds the order of the AR model. Additionally, the condition number of inversion of the correlation matrix as used in the 2ch-AFC algorithm can serve as a measure for monitoring the identifiability."

Two in-depth case studies, each illustrating international flows of raw materials and of data work services, portray the AI industry as a value chain that spans national boundaries and perpetuates inherited global inequalities. The countries that drive AI development generate a massive demand for inputs and trigger social costs that, through the value chain, largely fall on more peripheral actors. The arrangements in place distribute the costs and benefits of AI unequally, resulting in unsustainable practices and preventing the upward mobility of more disadvantaged countries. The dual footprint grasps how the environmental and social dimensions of the dual footprint emanate from similar underlying socioeconomic processes and geographical trajectories."

This structural limitation has catalyzed a paradigm shift in medical AI from generative text prediction to agentic autonomy, where the model functions as a central reasoning engine capable of deliberate planning and persistent memory. Moving beyond existing reviews that primarily catalog downstream applications, this survey provides a first-principles analysis of the cognitive architecture underpinning this shift. We introduce a novel taxonomy structured along the orthogonal axes of knowledge source and agency objective to delineate the provenance of clinical knowledge against the system's operational scope. This framework facilitates a systematic analysis of the intrinsic trade-offs between creativity and reliability by categorizing methods into four archetypes: \\textit{Latent Space Clinicians}, \\textit{Emergent Planners}, \\textit{Grounded Synthesizers}, and \\textit{Verifiable Workflow Automators}. For each paradigm, we deconstruct the technical realization across the entire cognitive pipeline, encompassing strategic planning, memory management, action execution, collaboration, and evolution to reveal how distinct architectural choices balance the tension between autonomy and safety."

This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments. Extensive experiments show that the M$^3$A policy significantly enhances cross-material generalization, improving the average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03\\%, and demonstrating robust performance on previously unseen materials."

DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively. These results demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to feature interaction and task balance. Overall, the experimental findings further validate that DyFuLM enhances sentiment representation and overall performance through effective hierarchical feature fusion."

In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference."

SocialDriveGen addresses this gap through a hierarchical framework that integrates semantic reasoning and social preference modeling with generative trajectory synthesis. By modeling egoism and altruism as complementary social dimensions, our framework enables controllable diversity in driver personalities and interaction styles. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset show that SocialDriveGen generates diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios spanning cooperative to adversarial behaviors, significantly enhancing policy robustness and generalization to rare or high-risk situations."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised and open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently gained attention, particularly in autonomous driving, where reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects are critical for both safety and scalability. However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines."

    "abstract": "Despite considerable progress in handwritten text recognition, paragraph-level handwritten text recognition, especially in low-resource languages, such as Hindi, Urdu and similar scripts, remains a challenging problem. These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods."

For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management."

To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance."

Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency."

(Integration, 2021). Relying on discrete event simulation, the Involution Tool allows fast timing simulation of circuits made up of an arbitrary composition of supported gates, provides automatic random input stimulus generation, and supports parameter sweeping. It also enables a detailed comparison of the delay predictions obtained by different models, including pure and inertial delays as well as digitized SPICE-generated reference traces. Our extension added support for 2-input gates like NOR and NAND, by implementing novel analytic delay formulas obtained via a refined analysis of a recently proposed thresholded first-order hybrid model of such gates. The resulting formulas faithfully cover not only multi-input switching effects (also known as Charlie effects), but also the decay of short pulses (aka Drafting effects). Besides the fact that our analytic models not only allow the derivation of closed-form delay formulas for arbitrary compositions of such gates, they are also key for a strikingly simple procedure for model parametrization, i.e., for gate characterization, which only needs three characteristic delay values. Using the extended Involution Tool, we compare the delay and power predictions for some benchmarking circuits stimulated by randomly generated input traces. Overall, our results reveal considerably improved prediction accuracy compared to the original Involution Tool, without a noticeable performance penalty."

    "abstract": "The representation of buoyancy-driven turbulence in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes models remains unresolved, with no widely accepted standard formulation. A key difficulty is the lack of analytical guidance for incorporating buoyant effects, including the treatment of the scale-determining equations under unstable stratification. This study derives an analytical solution of the standard $k$--$ω$ model for Rayleigh--Bénard convection in a horizontally infinite plane layer, where turbulent kinetic energy is generated solely by buoyancy. The solution provides explicit scaling relations among the Rayleigh ($\\mathit{Ra}$), Prandtl ($\\mathit{Pr}$), and Nusselt ($\\mathit{Nu}$) numbers that capture the trends observed in numerical simulations: $\\mathit{Nu} \\sim \\mathit{Ra}^{1/3}\\mathit{Pr}^{1/3}$ for $\\mathit{Pr} \\ll 1$ and $\\mathit{Nu} \\sim \\mathit{Ra}^{1/3}\\mathit{Pr}^{-0.415}$ for $\\mathit{Pr} \\gg 1$. Although this analytical framework provides a consistent reference for understanding how buoyancy enters the $k$--$ω$ closure, the predicted $\\mathit{Nu}$ scaling differs from experimental measurements. The buoyancy-related modelling terms are therefore reformulated to reproduce observed heat-transport trends across wide $\\mathit{Ra}$ and $\\mathit{Pr}$ ranges. By introducing only two additional dimensionless algebraic functions and recovering the original formulation when buoyancy is absent, the resulting corrections retain full compatibility with the standard $k$--$ω$ framework. The revised closures are validated across a range of configurations, including one- and two-dimensional Rayleigh--Bénard convection, internally heated convection, unstably stratified Couette flow, and vertically heated natural convection with varying aspect ratios. Across all cases, the corrected formulation yields substantially improved quantitative accuracy."

We further extend this invariant to sutured 3-manifolds and derive a decomposition formula for taut sutured decompositions. Moreover, we show that a taut sutured manifold is a product if and only if its universal $L^2$-torsion is trivial. Our methods are based on a detailed study of the leading term map over Linnell's skew field. As an application, we apply the theory to homomorphisms between finitely generated free groups, which enables explicit computations of the invariant for sutured handlebodies."

Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment."

Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability. Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity. Our results demonstrate that combining symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction enables reliable, auditable knowledge graphs suitable for regulatory compliance and web integration, supporting downstream applications such as sustainable-finance analytics, transparency portals, and automated compliance tools."

Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation.

While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability. Validated through rigorous real-world experiments in cluttered outdoor environments, the proposed system demonstrates robust cooperative tracking of agile targets (drones, humans) while achieving superior visibility maintenance."

    "abstract": "Convolution-generated space-time models yield an important class of non-separable stationary Gaussian Processes (GP) through a sequence of convolution operations, in both space and time, on spatially correlated Brownian motion with a Gaussian convolution kernel. Because of its solid connection to stochastic partial differential equations, such a modeling approach offers strong physical interpretations when it is applied to scientific and engineering processes. In this paper, we obtain a new dynamical model representation for convolution-generated spatio-temporal GP. In particular, an infinite-dimensional linear state-space representation is firstly obtained where the state transition is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose solution has the same space-time covariance as the original convolution-generated process. Then, using the Galerkin's method, a finite-dimension approximation to the infinite-dimensional SDE is obtained, yielding a dynamical model with finite states that facilitates the computation and parameter estimation. The space-time covariance of the approximated dynamical model is obtained, and the error between the approximate and exact covariance matrices is quantified. We investigate the performance of the proposed model through a simulation-based study, and apply the approach to a real case study utilizing the remote-sensing aerosol data during the recent 2025 Los Angeles wildfire. The modeling capability of the proposed approach has been well demonstrated, and the proposed approach is found particularly effective in monitoring the first-order time derivative of the underlying space-time process, making it a good candidate for process modeling, monitoring and anomaly detection problems.

We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations. We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators.

To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale safety study of AI character platforms, evaluating 16 popular platforms using a benchmark set of 5,000 questions across 16 safety categories. Our findings reveal a critical safety deficit: AI character platforms exhibit an average unsafe response rate of 65.1%, substantially higher than the 17.7% average rate of the baselines. We further discover that safety performance varies significantly across different characters and is strongly correlated with character features such as demographics and personality. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate that our machine learning model is able identify less safe characters with an F1-score of 0.81. This predictive capability can be beneficial for platforms, enabling improved mechanisms for safer interactions, character search/recommendations, and character creation.

To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples."

    "abstract": "The theory of normality for base $g$ expansions of real numbers in $[0,1)$ is rich and well developed. Similar theories have been developed for many other numeration systems, such as the regular continued fraction expansion, $β$-expansions, and Lüroth series expansions. Let $Q=(q_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of integers greater than or equal to 2. The $Q$-Cantor series expansion of $x \\in [0,1)$ is the unique sum of the form $x=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{x_n}{q_1q_2\\cdots q_n}$, where $x_n \\neq q_n-1$ infinitely often. For the Cantor series expansions, most of the literature thus far considers $Q$ where the theory of normality differs drastically from that of the base $g$ expansions. We introduce the class of dynamically generated Cantor series expansions, which is a large class of Cantor series expansions for which much of the classical theory of base $g$ expansions can be developed in parallel. This class includes many examples such as the Thue-Morse sequence on $\\{2,3\\}$ and translated Champernowne numbers. A special case of our main results is that if $Q$ is a bounded basic sequence that is dynamically generated by an ergodic system having zero entropy, then normality base $Q$ coincides with distribution normality base $Q$, and $Q$ possesses a Hot Spot Theorem."

It is found that with the variation of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent, the momentum spectrum exhibits the more pronounced oscillations, shifting and broadening. The total yield of created particles increases monotonically with the increase of the super-Gaussian envelope exponent in the high-frequency fields with small chirp and low-frequency fields with any chirp. Meanwhile, the total yield of created particles under the super-Gaussian pulse electric fields is approximately twice that produced with the usual Gaussian pulse envelope.

    "abstract": "The exceptional point has presented considerably interesting and counterintuitive phenomena associated with nonreciprocity, precision measurement, and topological dynamics. The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs."

However, in-situ characterization of the spatially confined THz modes within filaments faces significant challenges due to the plasma's ultra-high intensity, which not only hinders direct near-field probing but also limits reliance on indirect far-field reconstruction. Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies."

In this article, we analyze the process by employing the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. Conventional scale setting leads to theoretical predictions affected by errors dominated by renormalization scale uncertainty. The PMC provides a systematic method to eliminate this renormalization scale uncertainty by resumming non-conformal $β$ contributions into the QCD running coupling via renormalization group equation (RGE). We obtain a PMC scale result of $Q_\\star = 3.29\\ \\text{GeV}$, which reflects the low virtuality of the underlying QCD dynamics for the $H \\to J/ψ+ γ$ process. In fact, this is an order of magnitude smaller than the guessed scale using the conventional method, i.e., $μ_r = m_H/2$. By removing non-conformal $\\{β_i\\}$-terms from the perturbative QCD (pQCD) series, the PMC eliminates renormalization scale uncertainty. Comparing results, we find that the PMC NLO QCD correction term is significantly enhanced, while the PMC NNLO QCD correction is suppressed. This indicates improved convergence of the pQCD series up to NNLO. Finally, we determine the decay width $Γ(H \\to J/ψ+ γ) = 14.183^{+0.249}_{-0.347} \\pm 0.022$ eV, where the first error arises from the factorization scale $μ_Λ\\in [1, 2]\\ \\text{GeV}$, and the second error from estimating unknown higher-order terms using the Pade approximant approach.

    "abstract": "Standard Transformers suffer from a \"Semantic Alignment Tax\", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation."

Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors."

We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments. Overall, our results demonstrate that relaxing norm constraints can be a principled and effective way to encode and exploit problem-relevant information in online learning algorithms."

One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants."

    "abstract": "Collective dynamics in proliferating anisotropic particle systems arise from an interplay between growth, division, and mechanical interactions, often mediated by particle shape. In classical models of prolate, rod-like growth, flow-induced alignment and division geometry reinforce one another, leading to robust nematic order under confinement. Here we introduce a complementary regime by considering smooth convex particles whose geometry can be oblate for part or all of their growth cycle, creating a tunable competition between these two alignment mechanisms. Using agent-based simulations of elliptical and rounded-rectangular particles in both channel and open-domain geometries, we systematically vary the division aspect ratio to span regimes of cooperation and competition between ordering cues. We find that oblate growth can reverse classical flow-alignment, destabilize microdomain formation in intermediate regimes, and open up new regimes with modified microdomain dynamics in free expansion and sustained orientation dynamics in channel geometry. These findings are explained by an order- and shape-dependent mechanical relaxation interpretation that is supported by explicit measurements. This sheds new light on the available relaxation pathways and therefore provides key ingredients for effective descriptions of collective anisotropic proliferation dynamics."

The partial K function we introduce reduces to the usual K function when the other points are independent of the points of interest and has a similar interpretation. Using examples, we demonstrate how the partial K function can unpick dependence between point types that would otherwise be hidden in the usual K function. We also discuss important bias correction steps and hyperparameter selection. In addition, we discuss an extension to account for other spatial covariates, and demonstrate the methodology on the Lansing Woods dataset."

The result is obtained by recasting earlier approaches to completeness on manifolds of mappings as a general completeness criterion for infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that are open subsets of a complete Riemannian manifold and by combining it with geometric estimates based on the Michael--Simon--Sobolev inequality to establish the completeness for specific Sobolev metrics on immersed surfaces."

Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \\emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \\emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study."

Here, we demonstrate a reversible and energy-conserving integration scheme for the Sllod equations of motion with error on the order of $δt^3$, in line with typical operator splitting integrators used in standard molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss various implementation details, and implement the scheme in LAMMPS where we find that our changes enable more accurate simulation of transient responses, mixed flows, and steady states, especially at high rates of flow. Importantly, we show that a lack of energy conservation can manifest as a systematic error in the direct ensemble average of the pressure tensor, leading to an error in the calculated viscosity which becomes significant at high flow rates."

These experiments are tailored to mimic what is expected to be the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, which occurred circa 10 Gyr ago in the Milky Way (MW). We find that either an early clumpy phase or a retrograde merger significantly reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the disk, giving rise to a chemical bimodality qualitatively similar to the MW's. The decrease of the SFR as the cause of the chemical bimodality is consistent with previous idealized and cosmological simulations. On the other hand, a prograde radial merger does not significantly modify the SFR of the disk, resulting in no clear chemical bimodality. We further show that stars originating from the inner regions ($R_{form}<4$ kpc) do not create the disk's chemical bimodality, although they can enhance it. Finally, only the models with an early clumpy phase can produce a significant fraction of old, age $>11$ Gyr, $α-$poor stars with disk-like orbits, similar to what has been recently observed in the MW. Our results strengthen the case of clumpy disky galaxies observed at redshift $z\\approx 1-2$ as likely progenitors of our Galaxy."

We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms."

However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling."

To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks.

Using radio-frequency susceptometry and electron-spin resonance (ESR), we show how the temperature-magnetic field spin-dimer phase diagram evolves as a function of applied hydrostatic pressure and correlate this with pressure-induced changes to the crystal structure. These results, coupled with pressure-tuned DFT calculations, confirm the prior prediction that the primary exchange interaction is mediated via an unusual mechanism in which the V(IV) ions provide considerable spin density to the oxygen that joins the two spins in each dimer and which lies along the Jahn-Teller axis of the Cu(II) ion. In addition, the dissimilarity in the spins that make up each dimer unit leads to a non-linear field dependence of the electronic energy levels as detected in the ESR measurements."

Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI.

Our analysis leverages concepts from Lagrangian relaxation and duality theory to relate the dual function of the hard-constrained problem to the Q-function employed in Q-tree search and shows the connection between tree phase transitions and solutions to the dual problem obtained by exploiting the problem structure. An algorithm is proposed that employs knowledge of the tree phase transitions to find a setting of the dual variable that solves the dual problem. Furthermore, we present an alternative approach to select the dual variable that leverages the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained problem and the strong duality of linear programming. To obtain a linear program, we establish that a relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the hard-constrained tree-search problem has the integrality property by showing that the program constraint matrix is totally unimodular. Empirical results that corroborate the theoretical developments are presented and discussed throughout."

    "abstract": "Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize. We demonstrate empirical success in ECO's ability to generate stable long-horizon forecasts, capturing invariant statistics on systems governed by chaotic PDEs, including the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and the Navier--Stokes equations."

Using a particle-based model that resolves nutrient fields as well as cellular orientations and their inheritance, we investigate how orientational order emerges within expanding fronts whose morphology is set by nutrient limitation. We identify a transition in nematic order controlled by front morphology, with orientational memory influencing alignment only on one side of this transition. Under strong inheritance, orientational order varies non-monotonically: both thin active layers (fingering morphologies) and thick active layers (flat fronts) produce strong alignment, whereas intermediate cases are less ordered. Analysis of velocities, reorientation statistics, and stress anisotropies shows that this behavior reflects a shift from inheritance-dominated to mechanically driven alignment that overrides lineage memory. The resulting differences in front speed produce a fitness advantage of orientational memory only in the diffusion-limited, memory-dominated regime. These findings elucidate how nutrient supply, mechanical interactions, and single-cell expansion together shape self-organization during growth."

Our starting point is a Chebyshev representation of the call price surface on a warped log-moneyness/maturity rectangle, together with linear sampling and no-arbitrage operators acting on a collocation grid. Static no-arbitrage requirements are enforced as linear inequalities, while the surface is fitted directly to prices via a coverage-seeking quadratic objective that trades off squared band misfit against spectral and transport-inspired regularisation of the Chebyshev coefficients. This yields a strictly convex quadratic program in the modal coefficients, solvable at practical scales with off-the-shelf solvers (OSQP). On top of the global backbone, we introduce a local post-fit layer based on a discrete fog of risk-neutral densities on a three-dimensional lattice (m,t,u) and an associated Hamiltonian-type energy. On each patch of the (m,t) plane, the fog variables are coupled to a nodal price field obtained from the baseline surface, yielding a joint convex optimisation problem that reweights noisy quotes and applies noise-aware local corrections while preserving global static no-arbitrage and locality. The method is designed such that for equity options panels, the combined procedure achieves high inside-spread coverage in stable regimes (in calm years, 98-99% of quotes are priced inside the bid-ask intervals) and low rates of static no-arbitrage violations (below 1%). In stressed periods, the fog layer provides a mechanism for controlled leakage outside the band: when local quotes are mutually inconsistent or unusually noisy, the optimiser allocates fog mass outside the bid-ask tube and justifies small out-of-band deviations of the post-fit surface, while preserving a globally arbitrage-free and well-regularised description of the option surface."

Using a kinetic description based on the adiabatic motion of Andreev bound states, we derive a general expression for the admittance of a junction under a DC phase bias, formulated entirely in terms of the phase-dependent density of states induced by the proximity effect. A numerical solution of the full nonlinear Usadel equations that describe the dynamics of the junction is presented. The obtained results for the admittance and the Josephson current-phase relation apply to two-dimensional planar junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane Zeeman field, as well as to Josephson junctions formed with topological insulator surface states as the normal layer. The frequency dependence of the admittance captures the crossover between the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes, distinguished by the relation between the drive frequency and the inelastic relaxation rate in the normal region."

While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference."

Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance."

    "abstract": "Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects."

These two different policies, and their respective advantages, are illustrated numerically."

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations."

We derive two new SVRG variants by using Gaussian families: First, a Newton-like variant that employs novel Hessian corrections, and second, an Adam-like extension that improves pretraining and finetuning of Transformer language models.

ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis."

In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors."

Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating \"trend-driven\" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\\sim3\\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors.

Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs."

Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception."

We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables. The proposed mechanism enables each neuron to access a finite temporal input history. The framework is agnostic to neuron models and hence can be seamlessly integrated into standard spiking neuron models such as LIF and adLIF. We analyze how the duration of the delays and the learnable parameters associated with them affect the performance. We investigate the trade-offs in the network architecture due to additional state variables introduced by the delay mechanism. Experiments on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that the proposed mechanism matches the performance of existing delay-based SNNs while remaining computationally efficient.

For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible.

Across two controlled studies (N=480), we demonstrate that AI-generated content yields significant pre-post learning gains regardless of the specific prompting strategy employed. Study 1 (N=80) compares four prompting techniques, finding that even a straightforward \"direct-profile\" strategy--simply embedding user traits into the prompt--produces effective training material. Study 2 (N=400) investigates the scalability of this approach by testing personalization and training duration. Results show that complex psychometric personalization offers no measurable advantage over well-designed generic content, while longer training duration provides a modest boost in accuracy.

Previous VN studies have primarily focused on factors under the control of reporters, such as sender reputation, email formatting, and communication channels. Despite these efforts, remediation rates for vulnerability notifications continue to remain consistently low. This paper presents the first in-depth study of how HPOs process vulnerability notifications internally and what organizational and operational factors influence VN effectiveness. We examine the problem from a different perspective to provide the first detailed understanding of the reasons behind persistently low remediation rates. Instead of manipulating parameters of VN campaigns, we interview hosting providers directly, investigating how they handle vulnerability notifications and what factors may influence VN effectiveness, such as VN awareness and reachability, HPOs' service models, and perceived security risks. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 HPOs across shared hosting and web development services, representing varied company sizes and operator roles. Our findings reveal practical insights on VN processing and abuse workflows. While some providers remain hard to reach due to complex infrastructures, most report routinely handling VNs. However, limited remediation often stems from strict responsibility boundaries, where web application issues are seen as the customer's domain. Low hosting fees and high volumes of daily compromises further discourage both proactive and reactive measures. Our findings show that HPOs blame negligent website owners, and prior works on website owners confirms they often undervalue their sites or lack security know-how."

    "abstract": "We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids."

The $8_2 \\rightarrow 9_1 A^{-}$ methanol transition was observed in both CH$_3$OH and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH (at 28.9 GHz and 41.9 GHz respectively) toward three sources; G358.93-0.03, NGC6334I and G345.01+1.79, all of which are star formation regions with recent maser flaring events. We report the first maser detection of the 41.9 GHz line in $^{13}$CH$_3$OH toward G358.93-0.03 and the first confirmed maser detection of the 28.9 GHz line in CH$_3$OH toward NGC6334I. Additionally we report a maser detection of the 28.9 GHz line in CH$_3$OH toward G358.93-0.03, meaning that with our detection of the 41.9 GHz line, this is the first isotopic detection of these lines toward G358.93-0.03. The newly detected maser transitions are associated with the primary millimetre continuum sources (MM1) in both G358.93-0.03 and NGC6334I, within the varying positional uncertainties."

Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures."

Although this is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, its mathematical structure is analogous to systems of coupled classical oscillators. In this work, a three--pendulum system connected by springs is constructed as a classical analog of three--flavor neutrino oscillations. Measurements of amplitude transfer, normal--mode structure, and beat frequencies are used to extract a mechanical mixing matrix, which is compared with the structure of the PMNS matrix under the assumption of zero CP violation. A scaling relation linking mechanical time evolution to the neutrino \\(L/E\\) behavior is derived, clarifying the scope and limitations of the analogy. The experiment demonstrates how abstract concepts of neutrino mixing can be visualized using simple and accessible classical systems, offering both pedagogical value and a qualitative understanding of flavor oscillation dynamics."

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) extend large language models by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, significantly improving mathematical and logical problem solving. However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes."

For the mirror pair $^{7}$Li($p,α)^{4}$He / $^{7}$Be($n,α)^{4}$He and for $^{7}$Be($n,p)^{7}$Li the calculated $S$ factors reproduce both the absolute scale and the low--energy trends of the experimental data within their quoted uncertainties, whereas the absolute $S$ factors for the deuteron--induced channels on $^{6}$Li are underestimated at low energy, consistent with the shifted $^{6}$Li+$d$ threshold and the absence of a broad subthreshold $2^{+}$ structure in the present implementation. A partial--wave analysis identifies the dominant $J^π$ contributions in each channel and relates them to specific $^{8}$Be resonances, while demonstrating that cluster polarization, previously shown to be crucial for the $^{8}$Be spectrum, is likewise essential for the normalization and energy dependence of several $S$ factors. Evaluating $S(E)$ at appropriate Gamow energies, we obtain a hierarchy of reaction channels that quantifies the relative importance of neutron-- and deuteron--induced processes for the production and destruction of $^{7}$Li and $^{7}$Be."

This technology can for example superimpose faces and voices onto videos, creating hyper-realistic but artificial representations. Deepfakes pose significant risks regarding misinformation and fake news, because they can spread false information by depicting public figures saying or doing things they never did, undermining public trust. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages BLS signatures (Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham 2004) to implement signatures that remain valid after image cropping, but are invalidated in all the other types of manipulation, including deepfake creation. Our approach does not require who crops the image to know the signature private key or to be trusted in general, and it is O(1) in terms of signature size, making it a practical solution for scenarios where images are disseminated through web servers and cropping is the primary transformation. Finally, we adapted the signature scheme for the JPEG standard, and we experimentally tested the size of a signed image."

Furthermore, we prove the reliability and effectiveness of these estimators for approximate eigenfunctions, as well as the reliability of the estimator for approximate eigenvalues. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical computations on both uniform and adaptively refined meshes.

A central authority maintains a blind registry that records successful and failed identity verifications using only pseudonymous identifiers, allowing global consistency checks without exposing sensitive information or linking users across domains.

To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery.

To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning. Our training recipe integrates three components: (1) training data curation from VCG-32K, (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought (ToCT) for synthesizing reasoning trajectories, and (3) reinforcement learning with a designed causal reward to refine the reasoning policy. Experiments show that CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery, achieving over a threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain).

Previous calculations using the BCS approximation showed an enhancement of pair transfer, relative to treatments with no pairing, but failed to reproduce the observed enhancement factor between one- and two-neutron transfer probabilities. This work aims to microscopically investigate the dynamics of $^{40,48}$Ca + $^{96}$Zr head-on collisions below the Coulomb barrier, focusing on the role of pairing correlations in neutron transfer. We employ time-dependent energy density functional theory extended to superfluid systems, TDSLDA. Transfer probabilities, including contributions to specific $K$-angular momentum projections, are extracted using projection operators and compared to results from calculations without pairing. Our calculations show that pairing is correlated to the dynamic deformability of the nucleus, which influences mean neutron transfer in sub-barrier reactions. We also show that TDSLDA reproduces the experimentally observed enhancement factor by significantly increasing the probability of transferring a neutron pair in the $K = 0$ spin channel. These results confirm the strong influence of pairing and structure on sub-barrier multi-nucleon transfer, and demonstrate that TDSLDA provides a reliable microscopic framework for describing the interplay between nuclear superfluidity and reaction dynamics."

    "abstract": "Sub-Neptunes represent the largest exoplanet demographic, yet their bulk compositions remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggested that only very cold planets, such as Uranus and Neptune, could experience stratification of volatiles in their envelopes, implying that the envelopes of warmer sub-Neptunes instead have fully-miscible compositions. Here, we present ATHENAIA, an interior-atmosphere composition inference framework we leverage to assess the potential for water-hydrogen demixing on the $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}=350$ K planet TOI-270 d, and more broadly for warm sub-Neptunes, using radiative-convective atmosphere models coupled to interior models. We find that the higher temperatures at which hydrogen and water demix in water-rich environments, combined with the shallower adiabatic gradients of water-rich envelopes, open a window for demixing on sub-Neptunes with bulk envelope metallicities of $\\sim 100$ to $700\\times$ solar, compatible with TOI-270 d. Demixing is easier to achieve on more massive and colder planets, but still broadly affects warm (330 to 500 K) metal-rich sub-Neptunes. Therefore, combining atmosphere metallicities with models of fully-miscible envelopes may lead to underestimated bulk envelope metallicities and mass fractions. Further, our modeling of TOI-270 d's envelope and interior reveals that, for a typical internal energy budget $T_\\mathrm{int}$ of 25 K, the envelope-mantle boundary conditions likely preclude the presence of a molten magma ocean. This work encourages a reconsideration of the current paradigm for linking sub-Neptune atmospheres to their interiors and motivates further evolutionary modeling describing the onset of metallicity gradients in sub-Neptune envelopes."

The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers."

This quantifies the recoil's outcome without revealing its physical origin or the underlying forces that produce it. The recoil force and torque exist even in the absence of external illumination, such that an isolated dipole emitter can experience them. In contrast to the other terms, the recoil terms are odd under time reversal. To clarify their nature and properties, we re-derive the recoil force from first principles using the total Lorentz force on a system of charges that form a simultaneous electric and magnetic dipole. The results agree with the standard momentum-based derivation and reveal their ultimate origin from retardation effects -- arising from the finite speed of light -- in the mutual interactions between charges. This result provides fundamental insight into the recoil mechanism, offering a clearer conceptual foundation for future theoretical and experimental studies of light-induced forces."

Over-the-air computation shows promising potential for enhancing resource efficiency and scalability in such scenarios by leveraging the superposition property of wireless channels. However, due to the use of uncoded transmission with linear mapping, it also suffers from security vulnerabilities that must be dealt with to allow widespread adoption. In this work, we consider a scenario where multiple cooperating eavesdroppers attempt to infer information about the aggregation result. We derive the optimal joint estimator for the eavesdroppers and provide bounds on the achievable estimation accuracy for both the eavesdroppers and the intended receiver. We show that significant inherent security exists against individual eavesdroppers due to channel misalignment. However, the security level is greatly compromised when the eavesdroppers can cooperate, motivating the need for deliberate security measures. A common measure is to add carefully calibrated perturbation signals (artificial noise) prior to data transmission to improve the security level. To this end, we propose a zero-forced artificial noise design that achieves a high level of security against cooperative eavesdroppers without compromising the aggregation accuracy."

    "abstract": "Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements."

The analysis is motivated by a variety of early-Universe models characterized by signals with multiple peaks. We introduce a model independent parameterization of double-peaked spectra based on the superposition of two normalized broken power laws and perform a Bayesian inference study using the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA isotropic cross-correlation data. While no statistically significant evidence for a multi-peak background is found, the analysis provides constraints on the inter-peak slopes in correlation with the signal amplitude.

We begin by extending the mapping to the nonlinear sigma-model (NLSM) field theory for the case of finite evolution time $T$ and different classes of initial states, which lead to different NLSM boundary conditions. The analytical formalism is then used to study how quantum correlations gradually develop, with increasing $T$, from those determined by the initial state towards their steady-state form. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for several types of initial states. We further consider the long-time limit, when the system in $d+1$ space-time dimensions becomes quasi-one-dimensional, and analyze the scaling of the ``localization'' time (which is simultaneously the purification time and the charge-sharpening time for this class of problems). The analytical predictions for scaling properties are fully confirmed by numerical simulations in a $d=2$ model around the measurement-induced phase transition. We use this dynamical approach to determine numerically the measurement-induced transition point and the associated correlation-length critical exponent."

    "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction."

When these integrals lack closed-form expressions, numerical methods must be used, from the Newton-Cotes formulas and Gaussian quadrature, to Monte Carlo and variational approximation techniques. Despite these numerous tools, few are guaranteed to preserve majoration/minoration inequalities, while this feature is fundamental in certain applications in statistics. In this paper, we focus on the integration problem arising in the estimation of moments of scalar, unnormalized, distributions. We introduce a sequential method for constructing upper and lower bounds on the sought integral. Our approach leverages the majorization-minimization framework to iteratively refine these bounds, in an enveloped principle. The method has proven convergence, and controlled accuracy, under mild conditions. We demonstrate its effectiveness through a detailed numerical example of the estimation of a Monte-Carlo sampler variance in a Bayesian inference problem."

We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies.

    "abstract": "The popularity of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to automate or support the commissioning of engineering systems is rising. Conventional BO, however, relies on the availability of a scalar objective function. The latter is often difficult to define and rarely captures the nuanced judgement of expert operators in industrial settings. Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) addresses this limitation by relying solely on pairwise preference feedback of a human expert, so-called duels. In this paper, we study PBO's capacity to commission a particular setup where a manipulator needs to push a block towards a target position. We benchmark state-of-the-art algorithms in both simulations and in the real world. Our results confirm that PBO can commission the set-up to the satisfaction of an expert operator whilst relying solely on binary preference feedback. To evaluate to what extend the same result can be achieved using conventional BO we investigate the experts decision consistency against an expert-designed cost function. Our study reveals that the experts fail to define a cost function that is in full agreement with their own decision process as witnessed in the PBO experiments. We then show that the auxiliary cost function that is constructed as a by-product of the PBO algorithms outperforms the expert-designed cost function in terms of decision consistency. Furthermore we demonstrate that this cost function can be used with conventional BO algorithms in an effort to reproduce the optimal design. This proofs the preference based cost function captures the experts' preferences perhaps more effectively than the experts could articulate preference themselves. In conclusion, we discuss downsides and propose directions for future research."

The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign."

We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation."

We provide efficient algorithms for evaluating such path queries over property graphs, which exploits optimization of macro-states (among others, using theory-specific techniques). In particular, we demonstrate how such an algorithm may effectively utilize highly optimized SMT solvers for resolving such constraints over paths.

    "abstract": "With the giant exoplanet occurrence rate peaking around stars of 1.5-2 solar masses, there is strong motivation to characterize the disks that set their formation conditions. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O>1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O<1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks."

While the former has been extensively studied, omission-based deception remains largely overlooked, even though it can subtly guide readers toward false conclusions under the illusion of completeness. To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks."

We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-França [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost."

Being able to compare the organization of bipartite networks is a first step toward a better understanding of how environmental factors shape community structure and resilience. Yet current methods for structure detection in bipartite networks overlook shared patterns across collections of networks. We introduce the \\emph{colBiSBM}, a family of probabilistic models for collections of bipartite networks that extends the classical Latent Block Model (LBM). The proposed framework assumes that networks are independent realizations of a shared mesoscale structure, encoded through common inter-block connectivity parameters. We establish identifiability conditions for the different variants of \\emph{colBiSBM} and develop a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation, coupled with an adaptation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion for model selection. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to classify networks based on their topology or organization. Simulation studies highlight the ability of \\emph{colBiSBM} to recover common structures, improve clustering performance, and enhance link prediction by borrowing strength across networks. An application to plant--pollinator networks highlights how the method uncovers shared ecological roles and partitions networks into sub-collections with similar connectivity patterns. These results illustrate the methodological and practical advantages of joint modeling over separate network analyses in the study of bipartite systems."

These models are characterized by their extreme compactness and incorporation of a quantum core, successfully avoiding the curvature singularities typically associated with classical general relativity. Central to these models is the noncommutative parameter, which plays a crucial role in determining stellar properties and enables the exploration of various astrophysical regimes. While pure Planckian effects pose significant challenges for observational detection, our findings suggest that lower energy scales may reveal exotic stellar objects with Earth and Sun-like masses that lack classical counterparts, potentially providing the first experimental evidence of non-classical gravity. We propose that the metrics derived in this study can be tested against known neutron stars, offering promising avenues for future research aimed at understanding the interplay between quantum effects in gravity and stellar evolution, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of the universe's fundamental properties."

We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows."

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments."

The Great Recession has rekindled a debate on the validity and stability of the Phillips Curve which is still ongoing. The basis for this debate is the observation that real activity dropped sharply without causing a drop in inflation. This paper carries out an empirical analysis for the classical expectation-augmented Phillips curve model across 41 countries from1980-2016 by distinguishing tranquil and recessionary periods separately. Based on the results of the research, the paper finds that dynamics of Phillips Curve changes during recessionary periods and the empirical relationship becomes no longer valid. These findings support the ongoing debate about the missing disinflation and collapse of the Phillips curve, but only during the recessionary periods. In the case of tranquil periods, the empirical relationship still seems to be valid. Moreover, the paper also observes that both backward-looking and forward-looking fractions of inflation gain weight and significance during recessionary periods. However, the paper remains indecisive about which exact fraction gains more weight and significance as the panel model does not incorporate these two fractions of inflation in a single hybrid framework simultaneously."

In response, dashboards are being developed to capture and communicate progress in this area. To provide an overview of these dashboards and their characteristics, an extensive survey was conducted, resulting in the identification of nearly 60 dashboards. To support a detailed and structured description, a dedicated metadata schema was developed, and the identified dashboards were systematically indexed accordingly. To foster community engagement and ensure ongoing development, a participatory process was launched, allowing interested stakeholders to contribute to the dataset. The dataset is particularly relevant for researchers in Library and Information Science (LIS) and Science and Technology Studies (STS), supporting both empirical analyses of Open Access and the methodological refinement of indicators and policy instruments in the context of Open Science."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been widely used to analyze API call sequences in malware analysis, which typically requires the expertise of domain specialists to extract relevant features from raw data. The extracted features play a critical role in malware analysis. Traditional feature extraction is based on human domain knowledge, while there is a trend of using natural language processing (NLP) for automatic feature extraction. This raises a question: how do we effectively select features for malware analysis based on API call sequences? To answer it, this paper presents a comprehensive study of investigating the impact of feature engineering upon malware classification.We first conducted a comparative performance evaluation under three models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, with respect to knowledge-based and NLP-based feature engineering methods. We observed that models with knowledge-based feature engineering inputs generally outperform those using NLP-based across all metrics, especially under smaller sample sizes. Then we analyzed a complete set of data features from API call sequences, our analysis reveals that models often focus on features such as handles and virtual addresses, which vary across executions and are difficult for human analysts to interpret."

    "abstract": "Microstructural evolution in metallic materials feedbacks with the loading conditions and influences the life time of parts and components. Therefore, the deformation mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. Tribological loading causes a non-trivial, position-dependent, moving stress field. We present a systematic study on the influence of the complexity of the implemented material models on the calculated stress field. For the stress field validation, results of tribological experiments on single crystals with the activation of deformation twins are used. The resolved shear stresses calculated with the stress field models have to be highest on the experimentally identified twin systems. From this combination of modelling and experiment, it clearly follows that a stress field model considering plasticity is required. The widely used Hamilton stress field for tribological loading is limited due to only considering elastic strains. Here, the predictive quality of the stress field is sensitive to the assumed yield strength, work hardening and plastic anisotropy. Certain stress field models are close to the experimental data, but none completely replicate them. These results highlight that the model type and parameters have to be carefully determined in order to be able to predict how a metallic material deforms due to a sliding load."

We develop a compactness method to deal with the functionals involving logarithmic convolution terms. The Pohožaev identity for the coupled Schrödinger-Poisson system with a logarithmic convolution term is also shown, which is crucial for addressing the mass-supercritical problem."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the trajectories of charged particles in high-energy collisions requires high precision to ensure reliable event reconstruction and accurate downstream physics analyses. In particular, both precise hit selection and transverse momentum estimation are essential to improve the overall resolution of reconstructed physics observables. Enhanced momentum resolution also enables more efficient trigger threshold settings, leading to more effective data selection within the given data acquisition constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end tracking approach that employs the differentiable programming paradigm to incorporate physics priors directly into a machine learning model. This results in an optimized pipeline capable of simultaneously reconstructing tracks and accurately determining their transverse momenta. The model combines a graph attention network with differentiable clustering and fitting routines, and is trained using a composite loss that, due to its differentiable design, allows physical constraints to be back-propagated effectively through both the neural network and the fitting procedures. This proof of concept shows that introducing differentiable connections within the reconstruction process improves overall performance compared to an equivalent factorized and more standard-like approach, highlighting the potential of integrating physics information through differentiable programming."

StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs."

TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT."

    "abstract": "Particle filters (PFs) have become an essential tool for disease surveillance, as they can estimate hidden epidemic states in nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. In epidemic modelling, population dynamics may be governed by distinct regimes such as endemic or outbreak phases which can be represented using Markov-switching state-space models. In many real-world surveillance systems, data often arrives with delays or in the wrong temporal order, producing out-of-sequence (OOS) measurements that pertain to past time points rather than the current one. While existing PF methods can incorporate OOS measurements through particle reweighting, these approaches are limited in their ability to fully adjust past latent trajectories. To address this, we introduce a Markov-switching fixed-lag particle filter (FL-PF) that resimulates particle trajectories within a user-specified lag window, allowing OOS measurements to retroactively update both state and model estimates. By explicitly reevaluating historical samples, the FL-PF improves the accuracy and timeliness of outbreak detection and reduces false alarms. We also show how to compute the log-likelihood within the FL-PF framework, enabling parameter estimation using Sequential Monte Carlo squared (SMC$^2$). Together, these contributions extend the applicability of PFs to surveillance systems where retrospective data are common, offering a more robust framework for monitoring disease outbreaks and parameter inference."

    "abstract": "Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network."

    "abstract": "Light can carry a spin angular momentum, an intrinsic and extrinsic orbital angular momentum, associated with a circular polarization, optical vortex beams, and varying beam trajectories, respectively. The interplay between these momenta yields the spin-orbit interaction of light, in which the spin (circular polarization) controls the spatial (orbital) degrees of freedom of light: either the extrinsic (trajectory) or the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (vortex). While the well-known spin-orbit interaction of light plays a crucial role in nano-optics by providing spin-controlled light manipulation, the interaction between the intrinsic and the extrinsic orbital angular momentum - the orbit-orbit interaction of light - has remained elusive. In this interplay, the helical phase fronts of optical vortices control the spatial trajectory of light, giving rise to vortex-dependent shifts of optical beams. We report the orbit-orbit interaction of light in a plasmonic ellipse cavity, whose unique geometry facilitates the interplay when a vortex is considered in one of the foci of the ellipse. In this configuration, the orbit-orbit interaction is achieved by the interplay between the vortex of the source and the ellipse-induced transverse shift of the source beam, positioned at one of the focal points - thus inducing transverse vortex-dependent shifts at the second focal point. Strikingly, the orbit-orbit interaction of light significantly enhances the toolbox available for controlling light by leveraging the manifold orbital angular momentum states for vortex-controlled light manipulation - in contrast to light manipulation based on the spin-orbit interaction, which exploits the binary polarization helicity."

    "abstract": "This study models the monopoly pricing of weather index insurance as a Bowley-type sequential game involving a profit-maximizing insurer (leader) and a farmer (follower). The farmer chooses an insurance payoff to minimize a convex distortion risk measure, while the insurer anticipates this best response and selects a premium principle and its parameters to maximize profit net of administrative costs. For the insurer, we adopt three different premium-principle parameterizations: (i) an expected premium with a single risk-loading factor, (ii) a two-parameter distortion premium based on a power transform, and (iii) a fully flexible pricing kernel drawn from the general Choquet integral representation with nondecreasing distortions. For the farmer, we model index payoffs using neural networks and compare solutions under fully connected architectures with those under convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We solve the game using a penalized bilevel programming algorithm that employs a function-value-gap penalty and delivers convergence guarantees without requiring the lower-level objective to be strongly convex. Based on Iowa's soybean yields and high-dimensional PRISM weather data, we find that CNN-based designs yield smoother, less noisy payoffs that reduce basis risk and push insurer profits closer to indemnity insurance levels. Moreover, expanding pricing flexibility from a single loading to a two-parameter distortion premium, and ultimately to a flexible pricing kernel, systematically increases equilibrium profits."

Then, we build an analytical baryon EoM from the obtained FDM density and total potential by machine learning.

We first refine the analytical ergodic theory by proving that the continuum equation admits a unique invariant measure in the more regular state space H_α, extending the classical result of Da Prato and Debussche (1996) on the negative Sobolev space $\\dot{H}^{-1}_α$. To approximate long-time behaviour, we introduce an explicit fully discrete scheme that combines a finite-difference spatial discretization with a strongly tamed exponential Euler method in time. Uniform-in-time moment bounds in the $L^\\infty$-norm are established for the numerical solution, and a uniform strong convergence estimate with an explicit rate is derived for the fully discrete approximation. Exploiting a mass-preserving minorization tailored to Neumann boundary conditions, we further show that the numerical scheme is geometrically ergodic and possesses a unique invariant measure, together with polynomial-order error bounds for approximating the exact invariant measure. Strong laws of large numbers are proved for both the continuous and discrete systems, ensuring almost-sure convergence of temporal averages to the corresponding ergodic limits. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, including the long-time strong convergence and the accuracy of invariant measure approximation. Overall, the results provide a complete analytical and numerical framework for investigating the long-time statistical behaviour of the SCHE."

In so doing, we will witness how the combined use of shifted square and maximal functions causes a loss of sharpness; we, then, repair this through a trick, which allows us to remove the shift from the square functions, placing it purely on the maximal functions.

Established YCB and NIST benchmarks quantify grasp success, force, or timing on a single platform, but do not evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance, capabilities essential for modern mobile and aerial manipulation. This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case. Experiments demonstrate rapid embodiment transfer (median ~= 17.6 s across user groups), low holding energy for gripper prototype (~= 1.5 J per 10 s), and consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2 - 3.9 s and success rates exceeding 90%. CEGB thus provides a reproducible foundation for cross-platform, energy-aware evaluation of grippers in aerial and manipulators domains."

In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated."

We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks."

    "abstract": "We present the first algorithm for computing class groups and unit groups of arbitrary number fields that provably runs in probabilistic subexponential time, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH). Previous subexponential algorithms were either restricted to imaginary quadratic fields, or relied on several heuristic assumptions that have long resisted rigorous analysis. The heart of our method is a new general strategy to provably solve a recurring computational problem in number theory (assuming ERH): given an ideal class $[\\mathfrak{a}]$ of a number field $K$, sample an ideal $\\mathfrak b \\in [\\mathfrak{a}]$ belonging to a particular family of ideals (e.g., the family of smooth ideals, or near-prime ideals). More precisely, let $\\mathcal{S}$ be an arbitrary family of ideals, and $\\mathcal{S}_B$ the family of $B$-smooth ideals. We describe an efficient algorithm that samples ideals $\\mathfrak b \\in [\\mathfrak{a}]$ such that $\\mathfrak b \\in \\mathcal{S} \\cdot\\mathcal{S}_B$ with probability proportional to the density of $\\mathcal{S}$ within the set of all ideals. The case where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the set of prime ideals yields the family $\\mathcal{S}\\cdot\\mathcal{S}_B$ of near-prime ideals, of particular interest in that it constitutes a dense family of efficiently factorable ideals. The case of smooth ideals $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{S}_B$ regularly comes up in index-calculus algorithms (notably to compute class groups and unit groups), where it has long constituted a theoretical obstacle overcome only by heuristic arguments."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of fair access and Age of Information (AoI) optimization in 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle to Everything (V2X) Mode 2. Specifically, vehicles need to exchange information with the road side unit (RSU). However, due to the varying vehicle speeds leading to different communication durations, the amount of data exchanged between different vehicles and the RSU may vary. This may poses significant safety risks in high-speed environments. To address this, we define a fairness index through tuning the selection window of different vehicles and consider the image semantic communication system to reduce latency. However, adjusting the selection window may affect the communication time, thereby impacting the AoI. Moreover, considering the re-evaluation mechanism in 5G NR, which helps reduce resource collisions, it may lead to an increase in AoI. We analyze the AoI using Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) and construct a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve fair access and AoI optimization. Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) is employed to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, and solve it using convex optimization. We also provide a large language model (LLM) based algorithm. The scheme's effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations."

We further find that the C$_{1h}$ configuration is prone to a pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortion, yielding two symmetrically equivalent defect structures that emit bright, linearly polarized ZPL at 1.80 eV with a lifetime of 10.17 ns and an increased DW factor of 41%. These nitrogen-vacancy-related defects explain the origins of visible quantum emissions, paving the way for deterministic and monolithically integrated silicon-nitride quantum photonics."

    "abstract": "We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs."

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) arrival times and impact geometry remain a major challenge for space-weather operations. Coronagraph-based techniques typically achieve mean absolute errors of order ten hours, while in situ measurements at L1 provide excellent magnetic-field information but only tens of minutes of warning. In this work we introduce X-CME, a framework that links in situ flux-rope reconstructions at intermediate heliocentric distances with a physics-based CME propagation model. The internal magnetic structure is obtained with an elliptical cylindrical, radial poloidal flux-rope model and embedded into a tapered torus CME geometry. The subsequent propagation is computed by solving a drag-based equation of motion in a Parker solar-wind background, including gravitational deceleration, self-similar expansion of the cross section, and an explicit calculation of the CME wetted area and swept area in the ecliptic plane. We apply X-CME to two events observed by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft, respectively, and propagate the reconstructed structures to Earth and Mars. For both cases, the model reproduces the observed in situ signatures at L1 and predicts the CME arrival time at Earth with errors of a few hours (typically about 2-4 hours), while correctly distinguishing between central encounters and glancing blows. These results demonstrate that combining intermediate-distance magnetic reconstructions with a geometrically consistent propagation scheme can substantially improve CME arrival-time forecasts and impact assessment in the inner heliosphere."

    "abstract": "This study examines the digital representation of African languages and the challenges this presents for current language detection tools. We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms. It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is a popular approach for distributed learning due to its security and computational benefits. With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references."

CALPHAD calculations were performed using FactSage 8.2 software (SGTE and FTLite database) to guide alloy selection, followed by synthesis and detailed characterization of melting point, latent heat, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity. Critically, the thermal reliability of these materials was evaluated under repeated solid-liquid cycling up to 100 cycles in oxidizing atmospheres, revealing their stability and degradation profiles.

    "abstract": "Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately."

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of natural language processing techniques has led to an unprecedented growth of text classifiers across the modern web. Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier. Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics. We further validate our framework on an undocumented HuggingFace classifier, enabling fine-grained label interpretation and supporting responsible AI auditing."

    "abstract": "Understanding the temporal dynamics of functional brain connectivity is important for addressing various questions in network neuroscience, such as how connectivity affects cognition and changes with disease. A fundamental challenge is to evaluate whether connectivity truly exhibits dynamics, or simply is static. The most common frequentist approach uses sliding-window methods to model functional connectivity over time, but this requires defining appropriate sampling distributions and hyperparameters, such as window length, which imposes specific assumptions on the dynamics. Here, we explore how these assumptions influence the detection of dynamic connectivity, and introduce an alternative approach based on Bayesian hypothesis testing with Wishart processes. This framework encodes assumptions through prior distributions, allowing prior knowledge on the time-dependent structure of connectivity to be incorporated into the model. Moreover, this framework provides evidence for both dynamic and static connectivity, offering additional information. Using simulations, we compare the frequentist and Bayesian approaches and demonstrate how different assumptions affect the detection of dynamic connectivity. Finally, by applying both approaches to an fMRI working-memory task, we find that conclusions at the individual level vary with modeling choices, while group-level results are more robust. Our work highlights the importance of carefully considering modeling assumptions when evaluating dynamic connectivity."

However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70."

To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings."

Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context."

When jump rates are heavy-tailed in one of the directions, we prove that the random walk becomes superdiffusive in that direction, with an explicit scaling limit written as a two-dimensional Brownian motion time-changed (in one of the components) by a process introduced by Kesten and Spitzer in 1979. In the case of a fully degenerate environment, a sufficient condition for non-explosion is provided, and conjectures on the associated scaling limit are formulated."

To do so, in-situ spectral reflectance measurement is used, combined with ex-situ layer thickness and composition measurement by x-ray diffraction enabling for precise determination of the optical indices with an accuracy better than 1%. To validate our measurements, we realized the complete automation of the growth of a GaAs/AlAs 940 nm-DBR by molecular beam epitaxy, without the need to pre-calibrate cells fluxes. The fabricated DBR shows a deviation of 0.2 nm of the stop-band central-wavelength compared to the targeted one.

    "abstract": "Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning."

The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath."

    "abstract": "Event-driven systems in fields such as neuroscience, social networks, and finance often exhibit dynamics influenced by continuously evolving external covariates. Motivated by these applications, we introduce a new class of multivariate Hawkes processes, in which the spontaneous rate of events is modulated by a diffusion process. This framework allows the point process to adapt dynamically to continuously evolving covariates, capturing both intrinsic self-excitation and external influences. In this article, we establish the probabilistic properties of the coupled process, proving stability and ergodicity under moderate assumptions. Classical functional results, including law of large numbers and mixing properties, are extended to this diffusion-driven setting. Building on these results, we study parametric inference for the Hawkes component: we derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator in the long-time regime, and derive stronger convergence results under additional assumptions on the covariate process. We further propose hypothesis testing procedures to assess the statistical relevance of the covariate. Simulation studies illustrate the validity of the asymptotic results and the effectiveness of the proposed inference methods. Overall, this work provides theoretical and practical foundations for diffusion-driven Hawkes models."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Mean Field Game (MFG) model for maritime traffic flow, treating the navigation of ships between seaports as a large-scale stochastic control problem. The MFG framework enables the modeling of agents at a microscopic level as rational decision-makers who seek to optimize their utility, thereby translating complex microscopic behaviors into macroscopic models. We build upon this MFG framework to develop a mesoscopic-scale MFG model that defines the payoff and cost functions for a coordinator at each seaport considered in our study. The coordinator determines the routes taken by ships transporting goods between ports by evaluating several key factors: transportation costs, expected profit margins from loading specific goods at the seaports and unloading them at various destinations, and a congestion term that reflects the costs associated with accessing the destination port. We derive an explicit solution for the stationary version of the model under certain approximations and establish conditions necessary to ensure the uniqueness of the corresponding Mean Field Equilibrium (MFE). Furthermore, we introduce a statistical methodology to infer the parameters of the game from real-world data, specifically focusing on costs and the components of expected commercial margins. To validate our model in a real-world context, we analyze the ShipFix dataset of daily ''Dry Coal'' shipments worldwide from 2015 to 2025. Our discussion highlights the influence of empirical traffic flow on various components of costs. We believe that this research represents a significant advancement in the application of MFGs for effective maritime traffic management and offers valuable insights for practitioners in the field."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for persuasion, such as in political communication and marketing, where they affect how people think, choose, and act. Yet, empirical findings on the effectiveness of LLMs in persuasion compared to humans remain inconsistent. The aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analytically assess whether LLMs differ from humans in persuasive effectiveness. We identified $7$ studies with 17,422 participants primarily recruited from English-speaking countries and $12$ effect size estimates. Egger's test indicated potential small-study effects ($p = .018$), but the trim-and-fill analysis did not impute any missing studies, suggesting a low risk of publication bias. We then compute the standardized effect sizes based on Hedges' $g$. The results show no significant overall difference in persuasive performance between LLMs and humans ($g = 0.02$, $p = .530$). However, we observe substantial heterogeneity across studies ($I^2 = 75.97\\%$), suggesting that persuasiveness strongly depends on contextual factors. In separate exploratory moderator analyses, no individual factor (e.g., LLM model, conversation design, or domain) reached statistical significance, which may be due to the limited number of studies. When considered jointly in a combined model, these factors explained a large proportion of the between-study variance ($R^2 = 81.93\\%$), and residual heterogeneity is low ($I^2 = 35.51\\%$). Although based on a small number of studies, this suggests that differences in LLM model, conversation design, and domain are important contextual factors in shaping persuasive performance, and that single-factor tests may understate their influence. Our results highlight that LLMs can match human performance in persuasion, but their success depends strongly on how they are implemented and embedded in communication contexts."

The level of randomness in Liouville theory is measured by the coupling constant $γ\\in(0,2)$, the semi-classical limit corresponding to taking $γ\\to0$. Based on the probabilistic definition of Liouville theory, we prove that this semi-classical limit exists and does give rise to this deterministic geometry. At second order this limit is described in terms of a massive Gaussian free field with Robin boundary conditions. This in turn allows to implement CFT-inspired techniques in a deterministic setting: in particular we define the classical stress-energy tensor, show that it can be expressed in terms of accessory parameters (written as regularized derivatives of the Liouville action), and that it gives rise to classical higher equations of motion."

This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance."

Our aim is to tap the benefits of frequent trading over short horizons while acknowledging that drift is hard to pin down, whereas volatility can be screened using realized or implied measures for appropriately selected assets. Rather than time-rectangular distributional robust control -- which replenishes adversarial power at every instant and induces over-pessimism -- we place a single ambiguity set on the drift prior within a Bayesian Merton model. This prior-level ambiguity preserves learning and tractability: a minimax swap reduces the robust control to optimizing a nonlinear functional of the prior, enabling Karatzas and Zhao \\cite{KZ98}-type's closed-form evaluation for each candidate prior. We then characterize small-radius worst-case priors under Wasserstein uncertainty via an explicit asymptotically optimal pushforward of the nominal prior, and we calibrate the ambiguity radius through a nonlinear Wasserstein projection tailored to the Merton functional. Synthetic and real-data studies demonstrate reduced pessimism relative to DRC and improved performance over myopic DRO-Markowitz under frequent rebalancing."

The resulting PF framework reproduces microstructural evolution, yielding realistic porosity levels and continuous phase boundaries in close agreement with experimental observations. The predicted hydrated microstructures are subsequently used in a computational homogenization scheme to evaluate the elastic response of the material. The PF-derived mechanical properties show good agreement with experimental trends, supporting the ability of the proposed framework to consistently link hydration chemistry, microstructure formation, and the resulting mechanical response."

Existing adaptation strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focus on individual models and do not exploit the complementary strengths across models. Probing methods offer a promising alternative by extracting information from frozen models, but current techniques do not scale well with large feature sets and often rely on dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models. Our results demonstrate that ComBo offers a practical and general-purpose framework for combining diverse representations from multiple FMs."

Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube."

This work targets per-cell per-beam radio mapping from 5G new radio (NR) synchronization signal (SS) burst sets. Conventional processing treats interference as noise and focuses on the strongest link, which is insufficient to comprehensive awareness of the radio environment and ineffective in dense multi-cell low-altitude scenarios. We propose a successive waveform reconstruction and cancellation framework that iteratively estimates, reconstructs, and subtracts the SSs of stronger BSs, thereby enabling reliable detection and estimation of ultra-weak signals. To support this, we introduce the notion of a carrier frequency offset (CFO)-coherent block within which a common-CFO/per-synchronization signal block (SSB)-channel model holds and design a joint CFO-channel estimator that coherently aggregates multiple SSBs within each CFO-coherent block. We further derive closed-form scaling laws that relate estimation accuracy to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) speed, motion geometry, burst periodicity, and the length of the CFO-coherent block. Simulations show that the proposed framework can detect and estimate SSs at signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) levels down to -30 dB. Field tests at 150 m altitude demonstrate per-beam coverage maps for more than ten overlapping BSs and reveal that, despite strong received power, the measured SINR rarely exceeds 10 dB, underscoring the need for careful interference management in low-altitude airspace."

It is well known that the combination of broken time-reversal symmetry and broken inversion symmetry can generate non-reciprocal phenomena, but the interplay between these kinds of systems and superconductivity is not well known. We present Josephson junctions fabricated from Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ that give magnetic diffraction patterns with asymmetry in both the magnetic field and the critical current. The non-reciprocity in positive critical current and negative critical current, generally called the Josephson diode effect, has an efficiency of up to $η=20\\%$ in some parts of the magnetic diffraction pattern and persists even at zero applied field. We propose that pinned Abrikosov vortices are a main mechanism for the asymmetric magnetic field response in this system, and that the non-zero spin chirality of the Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ causes the diode effect. Simulations of magnetic diffraction patterns from Josephson junctions with vortices present show offsets from zero-field consistent with observations, while simulations of chiral spin structures with an out-of-plane canting show a diode effect."

The theoretical criteria for stable mass transfer in DWDBs is calculated assuming that component white dwarfs are completely cold and degenerate. Respective fractions of surviving AM CVn and DWDB which merge are then calculated by applying this criteria to population synthesis estimates for Galactic DWDB. However, emerging observations of the local DWDB population suggest that Helium white dwarf (He WD) components are typically hot, and only partially degenerate when they begin mass transferring. Using recent numerical simulations of He WD donors in DWDBs, we qualitatively describe a temperature dependent stable mass transfer criteria for Galactic DWDBs. Mass transfer is even more stable than previously thought, or equivalently, DWDB mergers are even rarer. Realistic finite temperature treatments will deepen the dearth in observed AM CVn binaries compared to DWDB merger products."

In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively."

Our experiments demonstrate that modality augmentation consistently enhances policy performance across different embodiments. Specifically, for the GR1, integrating contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion improves online success rates from 51% to 63%. Furthermore, in the G1 \"Pick Apple to Bowl\" task, our contact-augmented model achieves a success rate of 94%, significantly outperforming the 48% achieved by standard fine-tuning and the 0% baseline of zero-shot transfer. These results highlight that lightweight post-processing effectively strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to the Unitree G1. Consequently, this work establishes a unified, data-centric pathway for extending foundation robot policies through targeted modality design and multi-modal fine-tuning."

The retarded Green functions of dual conformal field theory have bulk-cone singularities associated with null trajectories in the bulk and we obtain the singularities specific to a horizon-less geometry. We also observe echoes coming from waves reflected behind the photon sphere. The existence of echoes implies the modification of geometry inside the photon sphere."

    "abstract": "Motivated by an application to study the impact of temperature, precipitation and irrigation on soybean yield, this article proposes a sparse semi-parametric functional quantile model. The model is called ``sparse'' because the functional coefficients are only nonzero in the local time region where the functional covariates have significant effects on the response under different quantile levels. To tackle the computational and theoretical challenges in optimizing the quantile loss function added with a concave penalty, we develop a novel Convolution-smoothing based Locally Sparse Estimation (CLoSE) method, to do three tasks in one step, including selecting significant functional covariates, identifying the nonzero region of functional coefficients to enhance the interpretability of the model and estimating the functional coefficients. We establish the functional oracle properties and simultaneous confidence bands for the estimated functional coefficients, along with the asymptotic normality for the estimated parameters. In addition, because it is difficult to estimate the conditional density function given the scalar and functional covariates, we propose the split wild bootstrap method to construct the confidence interval of the estimated parameters and simultaneous confidence band for the functional coefficients. We also establish the consistency of the split wild bootstrap method. The finite sample performance of the proposed CLoSE method is assessed with simulation studies. The proposed model and estimation procedure are also illustrated by identifying the active time regions when the daily temperature influences the soybean yield."

While traditional point-to-point pathfinding algorithms for EVs assume a known initial energy level, many real-world scenarios involving uncertainty in available energy require planning optimal paths for all possible initial energy levels, a task known as energy-optimal profile search. Existing solutions typically rely on specialized profile-merging procedures within a label-correcting framework that results in searching over complex profiles. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective label-setting approach based on multi-objective A* search, which employs a novel profile dominance rule to avoid generating and handling complex profiles. We develop four variants of our method and evaluate them on real-world road networks enriched with realistic energy consumption data. Experimental results demonstrate that our energy profile A* search achieves performance comparable to energy-optimal A* with a known initial energy level."

However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies."

In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned."

This stands in contrast to the classical problem of statistical inference from trajectory data. We establish unique identifiability results under several key scenarios, including cases with both multiplicative and additive noise, for both finite- and infinite-dimensional systems. Our analysis leverages the intrinsic structure of the governing equations and their quantitative relationship with the ergodic measure, thereby transforming the identifiability problem into a uniqueness issue for the solutions to the associated stationary Fokker-Planck equations. This approach reveals fundamental differences between drift and diffusion inversion problems and provides counterexamples where unique recovery fails.

Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing."

This approach examines end-to-end security properties of entire systems, rather than AI models in isolation. While we recognize that hardening a single model is useful, it is important to realize that it is often insufficient. By way of an analogy, creating a model that is always helpful and harmless is akin to creating software that is always helpful and harmless. The collective experience of decades of cybersecurity research and practice shows that this is insufficient. Rather, constructing an informed and realistic attacker model before building a system, applying hard-earned lessons from software security, and continuous improvement of security posture is a tried-and-tested approach to securing real computer systems. A key goal is to examine where research challenges arise when applying traditional security principles in the context of AI agents. A secondary goal of this report is to distill these ideas for AI and ML practitioners and researchers. We discuss the challenges of applying security principles to agentic computing, present 11 case studies of real attacks on agentic systems, and define a series of new research problems specific to the security of agentic systems."

Extensive validation against analytical solutions and established codes demonstrates accurate treatment of diverse polarization phenomena, including self-scattering polarization, dichroic extinction in aligned dust grains, and complex polarization patterns in twisted magnetic field configurations.

Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis."

However, social media data have many limitations, such as being scattered, incomplete, informal, etc. Together, these limitations represent several challenges to their usefulness to better understand bushfire evacuation. To overcome these challenges and provide guidance on which and how social media data can be used, this scoping review of the literature reports on recent advances in relevant data mining techniques. In addition, future applications and open problems are discussed. We envision future applications such as evacuation model calibration and validation, emergency communication, personalised evacuation training, and resource allocation for evacuation preparedness.

This sequential structure, often referred to as \"virtual observability,\" suggests that timing alone can shape expectations and choices, even when no information is revealed. The original notion of virtual observability, however, is an equilibrium refinement based on the timing structure and has no bite in games with a unique equilibrium. In this paper, we experimentally examine whether timing still affects behavior in such games, using the Traveler's Dilemma and the Trust Game. We find that in the sequential Traveler's Dilemma without observability, first movers tend to behave closer to the equilibrium prediction than in the simultaneous version. In contrast, timing without observability has no effect on behavior in the Trust Game."

We compile a novel dataset covering the enactment of cybercrime legislation in 132 developed and developing countries to empirically test this research question. We find that the enactment of cybercrime laws enhances the stability of the banking sector. This key finding holds across a comprehensive suite of robustness tests, including alternative measures of bank stability and model specifications. We document significant cross-sectional heterogeneity, with the effect being more pronounced in countries with heavier penalties for illegal cyber activities and legal frameworks that hold banks accountable for their cybersecurity practices. In addition, the positive impact is stronger in jurisdictions with greater international legal cooperation and effective enforcement mechanisms. We further investigate two channels (i.e., funding liquidity and operational risk) through which cybercrime laws may influence bank stability. Our results indicate that these laws can significantly bolster bank stability by enhancing funding liquidity and mitigating operational risk. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of cybercrime legislation in fostering a secure and resilient banking environment. It offers new insights into how these laws contribute to bank stability on both individual and systemic levels."

We present LLM-as-a-Judge (LAJ), a production-ready, rubric-driven framework for evaluating Gherkin acceptance tests with structured JSON outputs. Across 20 model configurations (GPT-4, GPT-5 with varying reasoning effort, and open-weight models) on 100 expert-annotated scripts over 5 runs (500 evaluations), we provide the first comprehensive analysis spanning accuracy, operational reliability, and cost. We introduce the Evaluation Completion Rate (ECR@1) to quantify first-attempt success, revealing reliability from 85.4% to 100.0% with material cost implications via retries. Results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones: GPT-4o Mini attains the best accuracy (6.07 MAAE), high reliability (96.6% ECR@1), and low cost ($1.01 per 1K), yielding a 78x cost reduction vs. GPT-5 (high reasoning) while improving accuracy. Reasoning effort is model-family dependent: GPT-5 benefits from increased reasoning (with predictable accuracy-cost tradeoffs), whereas open-weight models degrade across all dimensions as reasoning increases. Overall, cost spans 175x ($0.45-$78.96 per 1K). We release the dataset, framework, and code to support reproducibility and deployment."

    "abstract": "Achieving optimality and adversarial robustness in deep reinforcement learning has long been regarded as conflicting goals. Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance."

    "abstract": "Understanding efficient fish locomotion offers insights for biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and engineering. Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design."

Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors."

The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost. Results show that KNN achieves the best performance with R^2 of 0.865, MAE of 3.556, and RMSE of 5.240.

However, the dynamics of interchange reconnection in the low corona might be more complex than recognized before in higher temporal and spatial resolutions. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we analyze the dynamics of interchange reconnection in a small-scale fan-spine-like topology. Interchange reconnection that continuously occurs around the multi-null points of the fan-spine-like system exhibits a quasi-periodicity of ~200 s, nearly covering the entire evolution of this system. Continuous evolution and reversal of multiple current sheets are observed over time near the null point. These results reveal that the dynamics of interchange reconnection are likely modulated by the emerging magnetic structures, such as mini-filaments and emerging arcades. Moreover, a curtain-like feature with a width of 1.7 Mm is also observed near the interchange reconnection region and persistently generates outflows, which is similar to the separatrix curtain reported in the pseudo-streamer structure. This study not only demonstrates the complex and variable reconnection dynamics of interchange reconnection within small-scale fan-spine topology but also provides insights into the self-similarity of magnetic field configurations across multiple temporal and spatial scales."

There are thus two equivalent configurations with equal energy separated by a potential-energy barrier. Quantum mechanically, the molecule can tunnel between these configurations resulting in a tunnelling splitting, which in the case of H$_2$, is the same as the ortho--para splitting. In this work, we generalize semiclassical instanton theory to calculate the energy splitting of molecules in electric fields in full dimensionality. This goes beyond a perturbative treatment of the field and takes into account changes in molecular geometry during the tunnelling process which influence its electrical properties and can have a significant impact on the result. We first study the case of H$_2$ in a static electric field and then show how it can be applied to larger polar molecules subjected to oscillating electric fields, where we find that even large-amplitude heavy-atom tunnelling can lead to observable splittings."

This landmark result kicked off decades of research on designing linear or nearly linear-time algorithms on planar graphs. In an attempt to generalize Lipton-Tarjan's theorem to nonplanar graphs, Alon, Seymour, and Thomas [STOC '90, Journal of the AMS '90] showed that any minor-free graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$ that can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ time. The superlinear running time in their separator theorem is a key bottleneck for generalizing algorithmic results from planar to minor-free graphs. Despite extensive research for more than two decades, finding a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$ in (linear) $O(n)$ time for minor-free graphs remains a major open problem. Known algorithms either give a separator of size much larger than $O(\\sqrt{n})$ or have superlinear running time, or both. In this paper, we answer the open problem affirmatively. Our algorithm is very simple: it runs a vertex-weighted variant of breadth-first search (BFS) a constant number of times on the input graph. Our key technical contribution is a weighting scheme on the vertices to guide the search for a balanced separator, offering a new connection between the size of a balanced separator and the existence of a clique-minor model. We believe that our weighting scheme may be of independent interest."

We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\\sim16$ kpc and $\\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($<30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended.

Predictively oriented (PrO) approaches lift the statistical model $P_θ$ to an (infinite) mixture model $\\int P_θ\\; \\mathrm{d}Q(θ)$ and fit this predictive distribution via minimising an entropy-regularised objective functional. In the well-specified setting one expects the mixing distribution $Q$ to concentrate around the true data-generating parameter in the large data limit, while such singular concentration will typically not be observed if the model is misspecified. Our contribution is to demonstrate that one can empirically detect model misspecification by comparing the standard Bayesian posterior to the PrO `posterior' $Q$. To operationalise this, we present an efficient numerical algorithm based on variational gradient descent. A simulation study, and a more detailed case study involving a Bayesian inverse problem in seismology, confirm that model misspecification can be automatically detected using this framework."

In the limit of infinite matrix size, and when the time parameter is restricted to integer values, the second-order SFF reproduces the standard result established in earlier studies.

They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation."

The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) represents a leading hybrid quantum-classical paradigm for addressing this challenge; however, its widespread realization is limited by noise and the restricted scalability of current quantum hardware. Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes. In this study, resource requirements for VQE implementations employing the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz are systematically analyzed. The molecular Hamiltonian is formulated in second quantization and mapped to qubit operators through the Jordan-Wigner (JW), Bravyi-Kitaev (BK), and Parity (Pa) transformations. Hamiltonian reduction strategies, including $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ tapering and frozen-core approximations, are examined to assess their effect on quantum resource scaling. The analysis reveals that appropriate transformations, when combined with symmetry-based reductions, can substantially reduce qubit counts by up to $\\approx 50\\%$ and quantum gate counts by up to $\\approx 45\\times$ for the representative set of molecular systems under study. This provides practical insights for executing chemically relevant simulations on NISQ and FASQ hardware."

    "abstract": "Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable HITL methodological pathway for the translation of ancient, concept-dense texts such as TCM."

Our model employs the $(3,\\bar{3}) + (\\bar{3},3)$ and $(3,6) + (6,3)$ chiral representations while excluding the $(8,1) + (1,8)$ representation. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ representation containing symmetric ``bad'' diquarks, despite being energetically disfavored, is essential for reproducing the correct baryon mass hierarchy, particularly the $Σ$$Ξ$ mass ordering. The model incorporates both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, with the latter implemented through bare quark mass terms that properly account for $SU(3)$ flavor breaking effects. Our numerical analysis successfully reproduces the ground-state octet baryon masses and predicts the spectrum of excited states up to 2.5 GeV. For the experimentally challenging $Ξ$ sector, we provide specific predictions for spin-parity assignments: identifying $Ξ(1950)$ as the first positive-parity excitation. The analysis reveals that ground states are dominated by the $(3,\\bar{3}) + (\\bar{3},3)$ representation, consistent with the preference for ``good'' diquark configurations, while the $(3,6) + (6,3)$ contribution remains crucial for the mass spectrum."

Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows."

    "abstract": "Transformer models often exhibit brittle extrapolation, failing on inputs that are longer or structurally more complex than those seen during training. We introduce Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), an automated framework that improves model robustness by iteratively focusing on its own failures. At each step, CEDC uses the current model to generate a diverse set of candidate problems, employs a fast, executable verifier to identify incorrect predictions (counter-examples), and then fine-tunes the model on a dataset enriched with these discovered failures. We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks. Compared to static training and standard curriculum learning baselines, CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation, is 3.75x more computationally efficient than uniform data augmentation, and requires no manual difficulty heuristics. We provide a detailed analysis of the counter-examples, showing how the curriculum naturally adapts to target progressively more complex error modes. Our findings establish verifier-guided, failure-driven learning as a simple, powerful, and efficient paradigm for enhancing the generalization capabilities of Transformer models."

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

    "abstract": "The nature of the supernova remnants (SNRs) 3C 397 and W49B has long been a subject of debate, with prior studies offering conflicting interpretations between thermonuclear and core-collapse scenarios. To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$α$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations."

    "abstract": "Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates."

    "abstract": "As we deploy machine learning systems in the real world, a core challenge is to maintain a model that is performant even as the data shifts. Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \\emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \\ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \\ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \\ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work."

To address these challenges comprehensively, we introduce an innovative deep learning model, namely 3D-WISE, a 3D Weighted Interpolation for Super-resolution Estimation of fetal brain MRI. The model generates high-quality isotropic fetal brain MR images by learning the interpolation weights to correct misalignments between slices and volumes. These misalignments are estimated by extracting deep features from multiple motion corrupted stacks. Specifically, 3D-WISE incorporates two key components: (1) a weight learning module for multi view interpolation and (2) a feature extraction module guided by multi-type attention mechanisms. The weight learning module first maps motion-corrupted thick-slice stacks into latent feature spaces. The resulting features are then fed to an implicit decoding block to estimate interpolation weights of the surrounding points for a given coordinate. We further enhance our approach by incorporating convolutional block attention and atlas-induced cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our 3D-WISE achieves remarkably improved performance compared to the widely adoptedregistration-reconstruction framework. We also ex tend the experiments on anatomical structure reconstruction and achieve promising results, highlighting the significant potential of our 3D-WISE for fetal brain MR images SRR in clinical settings.

The fitness function, which comprehensively considers SWAP gates, CNOT gate costs, particle position information, and quantum behavioral factors, is designed with an adaptive adjustment mechanism to accurately evaluate mapping solutions. During solution updating, individuals are selected using the GAQCM selection strategy, and position update formulas from QPSO and GSQPSO are combined with crossover and mutation operations based on qubit coupling strength, leveraging quantum characteristics to avoid local optima. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the t|ket> and Qiskit compilers, QMS-FMO reduces the number of inserted SWAP gates by 46.1% compared to t|ket> and 65.2% compared to Qiskit for specific qubit scales, significantly improving the quality and efficiency of quantum circuit mapping."

However, they are among the most energy-intensive infrastructures as a result of increasing global computing load over the years. As data center power consumption continues to increase, examining their dynamic performance and interaction with the electrical grid is essential to enhance efficiency and ensure grid stability. This paper presents a comprehensive dynamic model of a 10 MW data center, incorporating 44,250 servers with a tandem hybrid heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system to simulate real-world data center under varying workloads. The developed model is validated using experimental data that demonstrate high accuracy in predicting server power consumption, heat generation, and dynamic temperature. Furthermore, to verify the fidelity of the model to operate in dynamic power systems, the data center model is connected to WSCC 9-bus test system to analyze the impact of various grid disturbances on the data center operations, such as load variations and three-phase short-circuit faults. The model can be scaled up and is valuable for improving the accuracy of dynamic stability analysis of power systems under high integration of data center load. In addition, the model is proposed to provide a practical framework for assessing compliance with fault ride-through (FRT) requirements and enabling demand response participation."

Building on this, we propose DyDRA, a Dynamic Dijkstra-based Routing Algorithm that exploits this matrix to construct low-latency paths in real time. DyDRA is lightweight and suitable for edge IoT devices with limited processing capabilities.

This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models."

    "abstract": "For offshore wind power transmission via modular multilevel converter-based high voltage dc transmission (MMC-HVdc) system, dc overhead lines have recently been adopted in China for the onshore transmission to the load centers. However, they are prone to short-circuit faults, and the resulting transient energy from both the ac and dc sides flowing into the wind farm-side MMC (WFMMC) may cause severe submodule capacitor overvoltage. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dc fault ride-through (FRT) strategy that coordinates fast transient energy control with conventional low-speed communication. In the proposed approach, both the wind turbines (WTs) and WFMMC adopt grid-forming control. Upon a dc fault, the WFMMC rapidly adjusts the phase of its ac voltage, thereby reducing and even reversing the ac power from the WTs. This effectively suppresses the transient energy and limits the capacitor overvoltage during communication delays. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed scheme reduces the required safety margin in designing the value of the rated submodule capacitor voltage by suppressing the overvoltage during dc FRT. As a result, it can reduce both the cost and the footprint requirements of the WFMMC. It also offers advantages such as reduced overvoltage duration during FRT and accelerated system restoration. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are verified using detailed simulations conducted in MATLAB/Simulink."

    "abstract": "Accurate multi-organ segmentation of abdominal CT is essential for many clinical applications, yet it often relies on large, fully annotated datasets. However, most available datasets are partially labeled, collected from different medical centers. To address this, we propose BAPLDE-MOSNet, a boundary-aware multi-organ segmentation network that leverages task-guided attention and dynamic feature enhancement modules to handle partially labeled data. BAPLDE-MOSNet integrates an edge prediction auxiliary regression network into the basic segmentation architecture in a multi-task learning manner. In addition, It introduces a boundary correction module by embedding boundary-related edge features into the segmentation task-related feature representation to effectively utilize boundary information to guide more accurate localization and segmentation of abdominal multi-organs. Moreover, a dynamic feature enhancement module is introduced to improve the network's attention to the target area. Our proposed method is rigorously validated on five public datasets (LiTS, KiTS, MSD Pancreas, MSD Spleen and the external BTCV benchmark), achieving state-of-the-art performance with an average DSC of 93.42% and HD95 of 3.635mm. Notably, it exhibits superior generalization on the external BTCV dataset (average DSC of 77.87% and average HD95 of 26.626 mm), outperforming both specialized single-organ networks and existing multi-organ approaches in comprehensive evaluations."

    "abstract": "The accumulation of large-scale multi-omics datasets has brought new opportunities for precise disease treatment. However, the inherent complexity of inter- and intra-omics relationships presents considerable obstacles to the precise integration of multi-omics data. Here, we propose a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation and Cross-Modal Attention Fusion (HCMAF) framework to integrate multi-omics data for patient classification and biomarker identification. Specifically, to capture both the specific information inherent in each omics data and complex cross-omics interactions, HCMAF incorporates three innovative modules. The hierarchical feature aggregation graph attention (HGAT) module captures intra-omics topological features through adaptive neighborhood aggregation. The cross-modal attention (CMA) module pinpoints inter-omics complementarity by modeling cross-omics dependencies. Finally, the confidence-driven multi-omics fusion (CMF) module dynamically integrates omics-specific predictions through learnable reliability weights. Comprehensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets show that HCMAF achieves better classification performance and consistently surpasses leading existing methods. Further component analysis confirms the crucial role of the HGAT, CMA and CMF modules in ensuring overall model effectiveness. HCMAF is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/DHUDBlab/HCMAF</uri>."

Students are first introduced to the cybersecurity principle of defense-in- depth through the study of historical castle features such as moats, drawbridges, and murder holes, analyzing how each layer served to deter or slow attackers. This historical perspective then transitions into the digital realm, where students investigate modern cybersecurity, including how quantum phenomena are applied to modern security systems. Quantum security encompasses technologies and techniques designed to safeguard digital infrastructure from the unprecedented processing capabilities of quantum computers. Through hands-on and inquiry-based activities, students connect concepts in physics to real-world cybersecurity challenges. Aligned with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards for high school Physics, this project directly addresses TEKS (9D): the student knows examples of quantum phenomena and their applications, and can give examples of applications of quantum phenomena, including the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. Fortifying Castles Quantum Leap inspires curiosity, sparks creativity, and challenges students to think critically, all while mastering state-required standards."

In this study, we investigate the performance of quantum annealing in solving the problem, comparing performance with classical solvers. Our results indicate that for smaller problems, the classical solvers are faster and return higher-quality solutions, but the quantum annealers have more favourable time scaling, which indicates a potential quantum advantage for larger problems. However, for larger problem sizes the annealer fails to return any feasible solution, which indicates that the problem would need to be reformulated to reduce size in order to achieve quantum advantage."

We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions.

For constrained combinatorial optimization problems, choosing appropriate penalty coefficients is crucial for obtaining better feasible solutions. When tackling the large-scale combinatorial optimization problems, the variable reduction method is one of the most effective methods. To address these difficulties, we propose a new variable reduction method called multi-penalty sample persistence variable reduction (MP-SPVAR). The method is based on the sample persistence variable reduction method, and utilizes the solution samples across multiple penalty coefficients to fix the variables. The proposed method is evaluated on the 60-facility quadratic assignment problem tai60b from QAPLIB using an Ising machine. The experimental results show that MP-SPVAR can obtain better feasible solutions than solving the problem without any variable reduction. The proposed method is promising for solving the large-scale constrained combinatorial optimization problems with Ising machines."

This is especially true in Lombok, Indonesia, which has rich cultural assets such as traditional architecture, weaving, and local wisdom practices that support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN. This study uses a mixed-methods research design with 240 secondary school students from six schools in Lombok to examine how well digital cultural heritage learning platforms improve students' comprehension of SDGs through culturally relevant educational content. Measured by pre- and post-intervention assessments of SDGs knowledge and cultural heritage awareness, the 12-week intervention included collaborative projects linking local practices to SDGs, virtual reality experiences of traditional sites, interactive cultural heritage content, and mobile learning applications. According to focus group discussions, 87 % of students said they were more interested in their cultural heritage and global sustainability issues after reading the digital heritage content, which they found more engaging than traditional textbook-based instruction. The findings show that students' knowledge scores on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have significantly improved (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$p&lt;0.05$</tex>), and they have a greater appreciation for cultural heritage. They are also better able to relate local cultural practices to the global sustainability goals, especially when it comes to sustainable communities, cultural diversity, and environmental stewardship. After the intervention, teachers noted that classroom dynamics and student participation in sustainability discussions had improved, with students showing especially high levels of engagement during hands-on digital activities. Digital cultural heritage learning is a promising way to successfully bridge traditional knowledge systems with modern sustainability frameworks to create meaningful learning experiences while integrating SDGs education with local cultural preservation in developing contexts. According to these findings, culturally-based digital education offers scalable solutions for a variety of cultural contexts in rural educational settings, aiding in both heritage preservation and raising awareness of sustainable development."

    "abstract": "Systems of linear equations are ubiquitous across science, engineering, machine learning, and even finance. While classical methods can be prohibitively slow for large-scale problems, quantum linear systems algorithms offer the potential for exponential speedup in certain parameter regimes. However, a significant gap persists between this theoretical promise and practical implementation, as the advantages are often obscured by the substantial quantum resources and high sensitivity to noise inherent in current quantum hardware. One way to bridge this gap is through the use of Iterative Refinement, a classical post-processing scheme that can exponentially improve the accuracy to which a linear system of equations can be solved using low-precision arithmetic. In the context of quantum linear systems algorithms, such as the HHL algorithm proposed by Harrow, Hassidim, and Loyd, Iterative Refinement can greatly reduce the quantum resources required to calculate an accurate solution in terms of tomography cost, circuit volume, and fault-tolerant overhead. Here, we compute and benchmark highly precise solutions to linear systems of equations of up to eight variables by running HHL with Iterative Refinement on NISQ quantum computers. We also present our open-source implementation, emphasizing that our circuit is not tailored to specific problem instances, as most available implementations are."

With this 4D model, considering large-scale scenarios goes with a significant demand of memory space, which can therefore justify delving into the domain decomposition strategy in the perspective of running on a distributed memory parallel machine or a cluster of standard processors. We investigate the required volume of memory and make it minimal considering the specific rules of the simulation. Next, beside ordinary code refactoring and optimization, we explore all levers of computing power at the level of a single processor, more precisely multi-thread parallelism and SIMD. Experimental results with various scenarios illustrate the possibility to handle bigger instances and an impressive global speedup (×20 on a specific execution scenario) compared to the original version of the code.

Gradient-based methods are crucial for analyzing PQCs and offer significant advantages in the convergence rates of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) compared to gradient-free methods. However, existing gradient estimation techniques-such as Finite Difference, Parameter Shift Rule, Hadamard Test, and Direct Hadamard Test-can yield suboptimal circuits for certain PQCs. To address these limitations, we introduce the Flexible Hadamard Test, which can invert the roles of ansatz generators and observables in first-order gradient estimation, enabling the use of measurement optimization techniques to improve circuit efficiency. For higher-order derivatives, we propose the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-fold Hadamard Test, which evaluates higher-order partial derivatives using a single quantum circuit. Additionally, we present Quantum Automatic Differentiation (QAD)-a unified gradient estimation framework that adaptively selects the most efficient method for each parameter in a PQC, departing from the standard practice of using a single method uniformly. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed methods yield up to a linear-factor reduction in circuit execution cost for real VQA applications.

This facilitates the assessment of the method's effectiveness under operational scenarios that realistically capture the variability and uncertainty inherent in modern distribution systems. The proposed approach was tested on the real distribution network of Pereira-City, using time-series simulations with realistic generation and load profiles, demonstrating effective voltage regulation and improved grid performance. Special emphasis was given to the computational time, which was significantly reduced compared to conventional voltage regulation approaches, highlighting the method's potential for practical implementation."

In this context, self-assessment refers to continuously monitoring a tracking algorithm's assumptions online without access to ground-truth data. Despite significant efforts to develop open-source libraries like the Stone Soup framework, self-assessment algorithms remain largely unavailable and unaddressed in these open-source frameworks. However, low-barrier access to recent research results and reproducible experiments is key to maintaining high quality and boosting the progress of future contributions. In this work, we extend and unify existing self-assessment methods to develop a generic self-assessment module. We propose integrating this self-assessment module into the open-source tracking framework Stone Soup. We present its algorithmic structure, provide an open-source implementation within Stone Soup, and demonstrate its application together with respective improvements inside the framework. Our implementation, which is available on GitHub, enables easy-to-use online monitoring of tracking assumptions suitable for various applications, providing valuable insights into algorithm reliability and robustness. By making these self-assessment capabilities openly available, with this work, we aim to lay the foundation for future research and development within the Stone Soup framework.

Feature selection using the ANOVA F-test reduces the dataset and improves the computational efficiency.

Previously, the existence of a long-range correlational structure known as contextuality was shown to inhibit efficient classical machine learning representations of certain quantum-inspired sequential distributions. Here, we define a new quantifier of contextuality we call strong <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-contextuality, and prove that any translation task exhibiting strong <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-contextuality is unable to be represented to finite relative entropy by a classical streaming model with fewer than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex> latent states. Importantly, this correlation measure does not induce a similar resource lower bound for quantum generative models.

Strong <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>-contextuality thus emerges as a measure to help identify problems that are difficult for classical computers, but may not be for quantum computers."

Two evaluation metrics: Code Similarity Score (CSS) and Overall Execution Score (OES) were used to assess the models, addressing the lack of comprehensive benchmarking in existing research. It finds that TransCoder performs well on simpler tasks but struggles with Python to Java, yielding a low CSS of 24.2.

Most previous research has predominantly focused on offloading tasks generated by IoT devices, which are limited in resources, to more capable computing infrastructures. However, the possibility that fog nodes themselves might also have tasks to offload has been somewhat overlooked in earlier studies. To enhance device performance and efficiency, we will focus on a priority-based AI-enable offloading framework in the edge-to-cloud continuum to predict necessary offloading tasks. In our proposed method, we will consider a distributed energy-aware offloading system based on ML technology. We will consider different parameters for nodes, links, and tasks in both initial offloading location and target offloading devices, which might have been overlooked in prior studies. We also use a metaheuristic algorithm as a priority-based model to determine the most suitable device for task placement, which is the second part of an offloading system."

This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment also works better if students are required to write and submit a conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies."

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation is the central problem of personalized systems, especially in those cases where user prediction needs to be promoted across different kinds of content (e.g., music to books, or videos to articles). Typical collaborative filtering models cannot work well in this environment because user behavior representations are usually inconsistent in different domains and most existing neural models have a problem of overfitting on individual domains and lack generalization. This paper presents a new self-supervised dual-LLM model of getting user embeddings to transfer across domains through multi-view representations. In particular, two domain-specificities LLMs are trained simultaneously, sharing layers of user embedding. Such embeddings are considered to be cross-modal semantic anchors, which are learned through a joint contrastive loss (where semantically similar user profiles in a domain are brought closer to each other) and a reconstruction loss (where intra-domain similarity should be maintained). This combined goal allows this model to map high-dimensional user embeddings in domain <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$A$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$B$</tex> into a common latent space so that in the target domains where user history may be sparse. It takes an advantage of both Masked Language Modelling (MLM), and next-item prediction tasks to retain modality-specific learning in both LLMs, and also use contrastive learning enforcement of alignment using positive pairs sampled based on implicit behavioral cues. On cross-domain benchmarks, the experimental results indicate an improved top-k accuracy, embedding similarity (via CKA and t-SNE distance) and across transfer tasks compared to current image matching approaches CDAN, DGRec and CoNet."

Unlike standard SABRE, which only introduces SWAP operations for qubit movement, TeleSABRE integrates both intra-core SWAPs and teleportation-based techniques leveraging qubit teleportation and gate teleportation across cores. This enables more efficient circuit execution by reducing both inter-core communication overhead and the number of intra-core SWAPs required to allow teleportation protocols and local gate executions. Experimental results demonstrate that TeleSABRE achieves 28% reduction across various benchmarks in terms of inter-core operations while also taking into account the logistics of the teleport protocols."

An alternative approach to a coplanar capacitor is to utilize the vertical dimension to define a capacitor using a vertical fin of silicon as the dielectric. Here we report on a vertical silicon fin capacitor for superconducting quantum circuits. A novel aspect of this work is a trench of controllable width on each side of the vertical silicon fin, enabling the additional superconducting quantum electrical circuitry to be microfabricated in or above the trench."

Compression techniques offer a means to manage this data, however, the challenge lies in reducing the data size while preserving essential details that ensure usability in practical applications. This study assesses both classical and deep learning-based compression methodologies, revealing that compression performance is closely related to point cloud density characteristics. Deep learning methods demonstrate efficacy with dense data but encounter difficulties in sparse regions. Geometry-based approaches are more suitable to handle sparse areas but are less effective in dense regions. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a hybrid compression approach that classifies the point cloud based on density and applies deep learning for dense regions and geometry-based compression for sparse regions. This leads to enhanced RD performance at bitrates below 4 bits per point, a range that reflects realistic constraints in practical applications."

Traditional methods of diagnosis are laborious and more subjective measurements that can lead to human error and delay in finding the true cause of a problem. The proposed method in this paper is based on deep learning which has a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure with the goal of automated detection and classification of dog skin disease cases into four categories, namely; fungal infections, bacterial dermatosis, hypersensitivity dermatitis, and healthy skin. The presented methodology trains and validates a high-resolution labeled database image set to the model. Data augmentation techniques such as azimuth, scale, and flip are also applied for better generalization of the model. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could give high performance measured by sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy against traditional diagnostic measures. This work can provide a path toward more efficient veterinary dermatology to enable timely interventions with better health outcomes for dogs. Besides, the model could be integrated into an intuitive application to ensure greater outreach for implementation in a clinical-facing setting. This study presents a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the classification of common canine skin diseases, including bacterial, fungal, hypersensitivity-related, and healthy conditions. The proposed model was trained on a publicly available dermatological dataset of labeled dog images. Key innovations include a streamlined preprocessing pipeline, application of data augmentation to improve generalization, and optimization for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

    "abstract": "Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However, connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has gained widespread interest due to its exponential computational capabilities. In practical scenarios, users often access real quantum computers indirectly through cloud-based platforms (e.g., IBM Quantum), which requires transmitting data to third-party servers. Quantum-specific attacks, such as crosstalk attacks, have demonstrated high success rates in inferring the output of legitimate users. These issues raise serious privacy concerns. To protect client-side privacy, quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) has been proposed, where legitimate users perturbed their true output by adding quantum noise to the circuits. However, we observe that the classical local differential privacy (LDP) properties have not been fully adapted to the quantum domain, and the information can still be inferred from the perturbed output if attackers access the noise type added by legitimate users. To fill this gap, we propose a novel QLDP-based approach to protect the true output of legitimate users. We find that QLDP can be achieved using only simple quantum noise, but not all types of quantum noise can effectively perturb the output under different quantum measurements. In addition, to prevent advanced attackers who have partial user information, we introduce a probabilistic noise addition mechanism. To allow legitimate users to accurately estimate the true output of a quantum circuit, we also propose a new quantum frequency estimation. Our approach is validated using real quantum computers and quantum simulators, achieving 94% accuracy and 90% utility to estimate the true output from the perturbed output."

    "abstract": "Engineering programmes face a dual challenge: high student stress and an industry demand for graduates with robust leadership skills. Although well-being is known to foster leadership in the workplace, its multidimensional links to leadership development within undergraduate engineering remain underexplored. This study investigates how Gallup's five well-being domains: Career/Purpose, Social, Financial, Physical, and Community relate to leadership readiness and whether these relationships differ across degree tracks. Thirtyfive well-being indicators were collected from 365 Mexican students in Computer Science and Technology (214), Biomedical (98), and Innovation and Development Engineering (53). Spearman correlations assessed domain-leadership associations; Kruskal-Wallis tests compared domain scores across programmes. Leadership readiness aligned most strongly with Career/Purpose well-being and showed large-effect correlations with Community and Physical domains; SocialRomantic ties were minor. Programme contrasts revealed significant gaps in Physical, Career, and Community well-being, while Social and Financial scores were uniform. Comparisons between programs showed big differences in Physical, Career, and Community well-being, while Social and Financial scores were the same. Consequently, professional purpose, civic engagement, and health perceptions are more significantly influenced by the curricular context than by economic or interpersonal factors. Targeted interventions, such as wellness modules for sedentary IT groups, career-planning workshops for Biomedical students, and community-embedded projects for Innovation and Development engineers, can help people become better leaders. The findings suggest that programme context, rather than interpersonal or economic factors, drives betweenprogramme differences."

To represent simulation objects, GNN models are built on mesh graphs consisting of mesh elements. Unfortunately, due to the difference between engineering simulation and well-known GNN applications such as social networks, existing distributed GNN models do not perform well on largescale mesh graphs, suffering from intensive message passing and communication overhead across distributed workers. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel distributed mesh graph network D-MGN. By a vertex-cut partitioning policy, D-MGN divides large mesh graphs into partitions. After the partitions are assigned to distributed workers, D-MGN allows local communication-free message passing within each worker, and performs distributed message aggregation with rather low communication cost. Evaluation on an example dataset demonstrates that D-MGN outperforms a recent work SAC by 38.66% lower errors, $\\mathbf{5 4 . 6 7 \\%}$ faster convergence time, and $\\mathbf{1 1 9 . 2 2 \\%}$ higher speedup ratio on 8 GPUs."

Excessive heat generation during battery operation can cause performance degradation, reduced cycle life, and, in extreme cases, thermal runaway. This paper presents a modular, Raspberry Pi–based Plug and Play Cooling Plate that offers a smart, compact, and scalable solution for real-time battery temperature control. The proposed system continuously monitors battery temperature using digital sensors and activates a thermoelectric (Peltier) module when predefined limits are exceeded.

The plug-and-play design allows for rapid integration into various battery configurations with minimal effort or hardware modification. Remote monitoring and data logging are supported through the Raspberry Pi, making the solution compatible with IoT-based applications. Experimental validation demonstrates improved thermal stability, reduced peak temperature, and faster cooling response times. Unlike conventional methods, this system adapts dynamically to temperature variations, enhancing both battery performance and operational safety. The work contributes a flexible and cost-effective platform that can be expanded or upgraded for future smart energy applications.

    "abstract": "The Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm is a well-established metaheuristic approach recognized for its exceptional ability to explore global optima and its inherent stability. However, the original GWO algorithm faces certain limitations, including slow convergence rates and a tendency to become trapped in local optima. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Golden Gray Wolf Optimization (GGWO) algorithm, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of GWO by incorporating innovative strategies to overcome its shortcomings. By utilizing advanced techniques, GGWO seeks to achieve faster convergence speeds and a higher probability of finding global solutions, thereby providing a more robust framework for optimization tasks. Initially, the GGWO algorithm employs an optimized point set for population initialization, ensuring a uniform distribution of gray wolves across the search space. This strategic initialization lays a solid foundation for sub-sequent iterative processes. At the start of each iteration, a non-linear adjustment of the convergence factor is applied, facilitating broader exploration of the search space in the initial phases and gradually shifting to a more focused exploitation of local optima in later stages. This approach significantly improves the overall optimization performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, the integration of the golden sine strategy enriches population diversity and enhances search capabilities. This innovative strategy not only reduces the risk of premature convergence to local optima but also boosts the algorithm's global search ability. To assess the effectiveness of GGWO, a series of experiments were conducted using 23 classical benchmark test functions. The results show that the GGWO algorithm exhibits exceptional solving performance and robust resilience, with a notable improvement in convergence speed. Moreover, the ability of GGWO to address constrained optimization problems was validated through its application in pressure vessel design, demonstrating an 18% improvement in solution accuracy over the original GWO algorithm and highlighting its superior effectiveness in solving complex practical engineering problems."

This paper proposes a transformer-based offset convolutional network (T-OffsetConv). This hybrid deep learning architecture combines the local adaptability of deformable convolutions with the global contextual knowledge of lightweight transformers. T-OffsetConv utilizes transformer modules to learn spatial offsets for convolutions, thereby ensuring the proper alignment of input features with tumor structures before standard convolution operations. Experimental results on a publicly accessible brain tumor MRI dataset demonstrate that T-OffsetConv outperforms standard CNNs, deformable convolutional models, and vision transformers in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. Ablation studies provide more evidence for the critical role that transformer-guided spatial alignment plays in improving performance. This approach has significant potential for clinical application, as it provides a computationally effective and morphologically adaptive means of classifying brain cancer."

Firstly, wearable devices are used to collect multi-modal raw data such as acceleration, gyroscope, and geomagnetism. The features of each modality are extracted through a multi-branch convolutional structure, and cross-modal residual connections are introduced in the feature fusion stage to enhance the complementarity of information. Secondly, an improved temporal attention mechanism based on a gated recurrent unit GRU is proposed. By introducing multi-scale time windows and dynamic weight allocation, the fine modeling of the temporal dependence of motion actions is achieved, thereby improving the ability to capture motion changes. Finally, the proposed method is verified on a real basketball court. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an average recognition accuracy of 0.91 − 0.96 and demonstrates stronger robustness in complex, dynamic scenes. This method can effectively enhance the dynamic posture recognition performance of basketball players using wearable devices and has significant application value for intelligent motion analysis and training support."

This work presents a quantum machine learning model that tackles the challenge of estimating metrics, such as cardinalities, execution times, and costs, for SQL queries in relational databases. Precise estimations are crucial for the query optimizer to optimize query processing in relational databases efficiently. Our proposed quantum machine learning model consists of a novel query encoding mechanism, which maps SQL queries into high-dimensional Hilbert spaces using grammatical representations of the queries. The encoding mechanism translates SQL queries into parameterized quantum circuits, forming the core of the quantum machine learning model. The parameters in this model are tuned using standard quantum machine learning techniques. This encoding was first developed in quantum natural language processing (QNLP), and this work demonstrates its natural application in database optimization. Because the encoding mechanism is mathematically robust, the quantum machine learning model is also explainable, allowing us to draw a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in SQL queries and the model's parameters. The method is also scalable because it consists of multiple circuits, and we train and evaluate the model with hundreds of queries. Compared to previous research, our model achieves high accuracy, supporting the results obtained in the original QNLP research. We extend the previous QNLP work by adding 4-class and 8 -class classification tasks and comparing the cardinality estimation results with those from state-of-the-art databases. This model shows a competitive accuracy compared to the estimators in the databases. We theoretically analyze the quantum machine learning model by calculating its expressibility and entangling capabilities, which have been suggested as representative metrics describing the model's trainability and learnability features."

    "abstract": "Protein–ligand binding affinity prediction plays a pivotal role in drug discovery, as it helps identify potential candidate compounds that strongly interact with target proteins. Instead of relying solely on traditional scoring functions or single-model architectures, this research integrates several advanced techniques such as a Multi-GNN fusion model (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and GIN), Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using GNNExplainer, and biologically meaningful dataset splitting strategies to improve accuracy and generalization. While existing models achieve good predictive performance, they often lack transparency in how decisions are made, limiting their utility in practical biomedical applications. Additionally, generalization across structurally diverse protein–ligand pairs remain a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel GraphLambda framework to combine multiple GNNs each of unique functionality into a unified architecture capable of capturing diverse molecular interactions. The CASF-2016 dataset is used to train and evaluate four prebuilt models under interaction, ligand, protein, and random-based splits. The use of GNNExplainer further enhances interpretability by highlighting critical atoms and substructures contributing to predictions.

This approach provides a reliable and interpretable solution for structure-based drug discovery applications."

    "abstract": "Applying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to high-resolution image classification is a significant challenge, typically requiring extensive classical pre-processing. This work proposes a QML model that uses a novel quanvolution-pooling to directly extract features from high-resolution images, eliminating the need for classical pre-processing with fixed or learnable operations. By utilizing a compact configuration of only hardware-native gates, our approach achieves a high degree of inherent noise resilience. We also present the first LIME-based explainability study of QML models for high-resolution image classification tasks. Our approach was evaluated on three datasets under both noise-free and noisy simulations, exhibiting minimal performance degradation in the presence of noise. Explainability analysis revealed that the model consistently focused on clinically relevant regions, even under noisy conditions. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of QML models for high-resolution image classification."

    "abstract": "Professional engineering skills have evolved significantly in response to the demands of a rapidly changing society. However, a persistent disconnect remains between the skills taught in university programs and those required in the workplace. This research investigates which professional skills are most relevant to common engineering activities in the workplace. The ten high-level competencies from the newly developed ‘Competency in Professional and Authentic Skills for Success (COMPASS)' framework were mapped against 86 engineering activities from the BeLongEng longitudinal study. Consensus-based mapping method was used to analyze taskcompetency alignments through a multi-stage process. This included (1) an initial consensus mapping of high-level competencies, (2) a micro-level analysis of sub-competencies, and (3) a post-mapping frequency analysis to quantify competency occurrence. This approach provides a holistic view of the competencies most relevant to graduate engineers. The mapping showed the strongest consensus around interpersonal and transferable skills such as communication, collaboration and project management, which identifies their broad relevance across engineering contexts. In contrast, core technical competencies such as problem definition, investigation and sustainability were aligned less frequently, suggesting they are more context-specific or embedded within broader tasks. A high rate of partial consensus in the mapping reflects the complexity and variability of engineering practice across disciplines. Overall, the findings demonstrate the value of the COMPASS framework for capturing the diverse professional skills that underpin engineering work. It also shows the complexity of engineering practice and the need for clearer articulation and integration of professional competencies across curricula and ongoing professional development."

The study also highlights areas where minor discrepancies persist, suggesting opportunities for refining assessment rubrics and improving evaluator calibration. These results support the integration of competencybased learning with standardized exam preparation to provide students with accurate, formative feedback and to ensure they are well-equipped for both academic evaluations and professional demands."

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms are of special importance in the research on quantum computing applications because of their applicability to current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The main building blocks of these algorithms define a relatively large parameter space, making the comparison of results and performance between different approaches and software simulators cumbersome and prone to errors. In this paper, we employ a generic description of the problem, in terms of both Hamiltonian and ansatz, to consistently port a problem definition across different simulators. A use case relevant to current quantum hardware has been run on a set of HPC systems and software simulators to study the dependence of performance on the runtime environment, the scalability of the simulation codes, and the agreement between the physical results, respectively. The results show that our toolchain can successfully translate a problem definition between different simulators. On the other hand, variational algorithms are limited in their scaling by the long runtimes with respect to their memory footprint, so they expose limited parallelism to computation. This shortcoming is partially mitigated by using techniques like job arrays. The potential of the parser tool within the toolchain for exploring HPC performance and comparisons of results of variational algorithm simulations is highlighted."

It includes essential clinical features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose levels, smoking status, and other relevant factors. Data leakage in healthcare ML models can lead to overly optimistic performance, misrepresenting real-world effectiveness. This study evaluates its impact by comparing models under both conditions using precision, recall, $\\mathbf{F 1}$ score and overall accuracy. Results indicates that data leakage inflates accuracy, while proper handling ensures reliable assessments.

This study focuses on selection of ideal guide RNAs (gRNAs) for use in the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a transformative genome-editing tool, to target crucial genes implicated in ASD, such as SHANK3, CHD8, FMR1, TSC2 and SCN2A. Using bioinformatics tools, including SnapGene for sequence visualization and Prosite for functional motif identification, we offered precise annotation of exonic regions and designed single and dual gRNAs with high specificity and efficiency. These gRnas have also emerged in ex vivo therapies such as editing stem cells for blood disorders and also cancer immunotherapies. Various computational techniques were employed to perform off- and on-target checks, enhancing the reliability of the gRNAs. By enabling precise genetic modifications, CRISPR offers a commendable approach to understand ASD’s genetical changes and pathophysiology. Further validation of these findings through laboratory protocols and clinical criteria establishes this work as a novel step toward the prevention and potential treatment of ASD, providing a framework for future studies exploring CRISPR-based therapies in neurodevelopmental disorders."

Existing FL benchmarks often rely on synthetic non-IID partitions that fail to capture real-world data complexity, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating FL robustness. This study introduces a structured partitioning approach for ImageNet that groups data based on hierarchical class relationships, enabling controlled variations in non-IID distributions. By systematically varying data heterogeneity levels, we assess the impact of different distribution shifts on FL algorithm performance. Our evaluation highlights how varying label skew, data volume per client, and distribution imbalance influence model convergence and generalization. The results provide a more realistic and scalable FL benchmarking framework, offering insights into algorithm robustness under diverse real-world data distributions and enabling more effective non-IID evaluation in FL research.Supplementary code is available at https://github.com/ fedlearn-hub/Non-IID_ImageNet."

    "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is perhaps the most popular linear projection technique for dimensionality reduction. We consider PCA under the assumption that the high-dimensional data points are equipped with Gaussian uncertainty. Several approaches to such uncertainty-aware PCA have been developed recently in the visualization community. Since PCA is a discontinuous map, a small uncertainty in the data points can result in a huge uncertainty in the projected points. We show that the uncertainty of the data points also creates uncertainty in the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that defines the PCA projection. We present a closed-form expression to quantify eigenvector uncertainty. Based on this, we propose a 3D glyph that supports the decision whether existing solutions for uncertainty-aware PCA are sufficient, or whether a more expensive sampling-based approach is required. We apply our approach to several test data sets."

    "abstract": "Mental disorders have become a major public health issue worldwide. Traditional face-to-face and clinical diagnostic methods are not only time-consuming and expensive but also rely heavily on the expertise of professionals and require costly equipment. With the rapid development of computer vision and deep learning, a growing number of studies are exploring deep learning methods to assist in diagnosing and evaluating various mental disorders. However, most current research focuses on a single type of mental disorder, which limits the broader application of these technologies. This paper proposes a novel system aimed at detecting multiple mental disorders, i.e., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and depression, within one unified framework. To make the proposed system both computationally efficient and robust despite the limited availability of mental health datasets, we first preprocess the original videos to extract cost-effective facial video segments and then fine-tune pre-trained models on these facial videos for classification. In our mental disorder detection task, three distinct fine-tuning methods are adopted for the pre-trained video-masked autoencoder (VideoMAE) model. Moreover, unlike conventional fine-tuning procedures, the proposed methods innovatively refine the attention masks during fine-tuning to prioritise facial features most relevant to mental disorders. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing multi-mental disorder detection approaches on standard benchmarks, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters, stable cross-dataset performance, and improved robustness. This work points to a promising direction for automated mental disorder diagnostic technologies."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance mobile edge computing (MEC) coverage, but in remote emergency scenarios limited battery life and scarce spectrum exacerbate interference, link instability, and end-to-end delay. To address these issues, we propose a joint trajectory and delay-minimization framework that integrates laser-beamed wireless power transfer (LWPT) with UAV-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) MEC. First, we present a practical system architecture where a ground laser-powered beacon (PB) continuously recharges the UAV during flight, enabling persistent aerial patrols that concurrently offer wireless charging and computation services to ground users. Second, we formulate a unified mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory, task offloading ratios, PB power distribution, and user-scheduling policy under energy-causality, NOMA interference, and flight-dynamics constraints. Third, to address the resulting non-convexity, we develop a hierarchical decomposition and alternating-optimization method: the original problem is decomposed into trajectory and resource-allocation subproblems and solved using convex approximations and efficient scheduling algorithms to obtain practical solutions. Fourth, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed LWPT-assisted NOMA UAV-MEC scheme substantially reduces total system delay while improving energy efficiency and throughput compared with conventional OMA-MEC baselines and five recent heuristic algorithms."

    "abstract": "Secure data forwarding involves converting decrypted ciphertext, initially readable by one user, into a format that can be deciphered by another user. Proxy re-encryption is a commonly employed technique for secure data forwarding. However, this technique faces two inherent limitations. Firstly, only the data owner possesses the ability to control which data users can decrypt the ciphertext, resulting in receivers receiving irrelevant or uninterested information. Secondly, when data is forwarded through multiple nodes, it becomes vulnerable to various attacks such as impersonation and forgery. A solution called bilateral access control addresses these issues by letting the sender and receiver specify access control policies that the other party should comply with and ensure message confidentiality and authenticity. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no existing bilateral access control scheme capable of achieving secure data forwarding. In response to this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving proxy bilateral access control scheme, which simultaneously achieves all the above functionalities. Subsequently, we prove the message confidentiality and authenticity under the standard assumptions in the random oracle model. Finally, extensive theoretical analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the scheme provides unique features and comparable performance."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication has emerged as a key paradigm in next-generation wireless systems. In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based radar systems with time-division duplexing (TDD), the separation of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) slots leads to spectral replicas along the Doppler axis, degrading sensing performance. To address this issue, we propose a convolutional long short-term memory autoencoder that predicts the channel state information (CSI) associated with unobserved UL slots between DL transmissions in a TDD frame. By estimating the CSI in unobserved UL slots, the proposed method effectively suppresses spectral replicas in the range-Doppler (RD) map. Simulation results under 3rd Generation Partnership Project New Radio numerologies (μ=1,2,3) demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts CSI values across diverse channel conditions. The model achieves a magnitude mean squared error (MSE) of 0.014 and a phase MSE of 0.038, consistently outperforming other methods. In addition, under equal parameter budgets, it achieves superior accuracy–efficiency trade-offs over alternative deep learning models, requiring only 7.2 ms per frame on a modern Internet-of-Things edge device. RD map analysis further confirms replica suppression, improving velocity coverage from 13.05 m/s to 613.5 m/s and signal-to-noise ratio from 45.16 dB to 60.91 dB compared with conventional methods, while maintaining target detection rates above 0.99. These results confirm that accurate CSI reconstruction by the proposed model significantly improves sensing fidelity in TDD-based OFDM radar systems."

This research work focuses on creating a predictive BFP model using anthropometric techniques. For formulating and validating the proposed model, a benchmark dataset is used consisting of 252 samples having measures of weight, height, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), skinfold thicknesses along with air displacement plethysmography (ADP) based density estimates. For feature engineering, the most important values are selected such as body mass index, hip ratio etc., as well as logarithmic values and then the best artificial neural network model is trained. The proposed model is developed using quadratic polynomial terms with a literature-based space-cost function (r > 0.98), provided the best model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.5% and coefficient of determination $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}} \\boldsymbol{=} \\mathbf{0 . 9 2}$ outperforming conventional works."

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in quantum computing in recent years, executing quantum circuits for practical problems remains challenging due to error-prone quantum hardware. Hence, quantum error correction becomes essential but induces significant overheads in qubits and execution time, often by orders of magnitude. Obviously, these overheads must be reduced. Since many quantum applications can tolerate some noise, end users can provide a maximum tolerated error, the error budget, to be considered during compilation and execution. This error budget, or, more precisely, its distribution, can be a key factor in achieving the overhead reduction. Conceptually, an errorcorrected quantum circuit can be divided into different parts that each have a specific purpose. Errors can happen in any of these parts and their errors sum up to the mentioned error budget-but how to distribute it among them actually constitutes a degree of freedom. This work is based on the idea that some of the circuit parts can compensate for errors more efficiently than others. Consequently, these parts should contribute more to satisfy the total error budget than the parts where it is more costly. However, this poses the challenge of finding optimal distributions. We address this challenge not only by providing general guidelines on distributing the error budget, but also a method that automatically determines resource-efficient distributions for arbitrary circuits by training a machine learning model on an accumulated dataset. The approach is evaluated by analyzing the machine learning model's predictions on so far unseen data, reducing the estimated space-time costs for more than 75% of the considered quantum circuits, with an average reduction of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 5. 6 \\%}$</tex>, including cases without improvement, and a maximum reduction of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 7. 7 \\%}$</tex>."

Conventional diagnostic techniques are subjective, time-consuming, and frequently constrained by the availability of skilled dermatologists. In order to automatically classify skin diseases from dermatological images, this study suggests a deep learning-based system that makes use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To improve input quality, important preprocessing methods like image resizing, normalization, and artifact removal are used. The model’s classification accuracy surpasses 85% when tested on publicly accessible datasets (ISIC, HAM10000). Furthermore, by highlighting ambiguous predictions, a confidence thresholding mechanism is added to increase reliability. By lowering human error and facilitating early skin condition detection and treatment, this method seeks to help dermatologists make diagnoses more quickly and consistently."

The common technologies deployed in the detection process such as the black list-filtering and heuristic-based detections fail to identify the new or modern obfuscated attacks most of the time especially in real-time. To address these drawbacks, part of this paper proposes a hybrid detection framework, which combines deep learning and ensemble machine learning models with reliable feature selection so as to avoid such drawbacks. This framework employs content-based features as well as URL-based features the dimensionality reduction and feature-ranking techniques of the information gain, and the Principal component analysis (PCA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the detection malware performance. Our stacking model, to be stronger and as effective as possible in terms of success in classification, therefore constitutes a conjugation of the functions of the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and the ensemble classifiers, among which the Random Forest and the XGBoost. Typical practical phishing computer network attacks benchmark shows that the proposed system has superb detection capability with a maximum of 99.2 percent accuracy rates with low false positive rates and latencies to enable the system to find real-time uses.

    "abstract": "Although quantum circuit depth is commonly used to approximate circuit runtimes, it overlooks a prevailing trait of current hardware implementation: different gates have different execution times. Recognizing the potential for discrepancies, we investigate depth's accuracy for comparing runtimes between compiled versions of the same circuit. In particular, we assess the accuracy of traditional and multi-qubit depth for (1) predicting relative differences in runtime and (2) identifying compiled circuit version(s) with the shortest runtime. Finding that circuit depth is not accurate for either task, we introduce a new metric, gateaware depth, that weights gates' contributions to runtime using an architecture's average gate execution times. Using average gate times allows gate-aware depth to capture variations by gate type without requiring exact knowledge of all gate times, increasing accuracy while maintaining portability across devices of the same architecture. Compared to traditional and multiqubit depth, gate-aware depth reduces the average relative error of predictions in task (1) by 68 and 18 times and increases the average number of correct identifications in task (2) by 20 and 43 percentage points, respectively. Finally, we provide gate-aware depth weight configurations for current IBM Eagle and Heron architectures."

    "abstract": "For decades, computational chemistry has been posited as one of the areas in which quantum computing would revolutionize. However, the algorithmic advantages that fault-tolerant quantum computers have for chemistry can be overwhelmed by other disadvantages, such as error correction, processor speed, etc. To assess when quantum computing will be disruptive to computational chemistry, we compare a wide range of classical methods to quantum computational methods by extending the framework proposed by Choi, Moses, and Thompson [1]. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of classical and quantum algorithms, and hardware, both today and as they improve. We find that in many cases, classical computational chemistry methods will likely remain superior to quantum algorithms for at least the next couple of decades. Nevertheless, quantum computers are likely to make important contributions in two important areas. First, for simulations with tens or hundreds of atoms, highly accurate methods such as Full Configuration Interaction and high-order Coupled Cluster are likely to be surpassed by quantum phase estimation in the coming decade. Secondly, in cases where quantum phase estimation is most efficient, moderately accurate classical techniques, such as Møller-Plesset, could be surpassed in ten to fifteen years if the technical advancements for quantum computers are favorable. Overall, we find that in the next decade or so, quantum computing will be most impactful for highly accurate computations with small to medium-sized molecules, whereas classical computers will likely remain the typical choice for calculations of larger molecules."

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this combined methodology through case studies involving Copper (Cu) and Silver (Ag) thin films, which share the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) structure, and Cu/Tin (Sn)/Cu3Sn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in solder bumps.

The proposed model demonstrates enhanced predictive power compared to variational methods such as quantum circuits (VQC), parameterized quantum circuits (PQC), and quantum residual blocks (QRB). The proposed QRU outperforms classical learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) with the same number of parameters. The novelty of this approach is its ability to model temporal patterns without relying on an extensive memory state, which reduces resource demands while preserving forecast accuracy. The expressivity of the model is evaluated through Fourier spectral decomposition. We analyze the trainability of our model using the absorption witness metric. We benchmarked the proposed model on the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series and the real-world river level dataset from TAIAO. The proposed model consistently exhibits enhanced expressivity over both of the datasets. These results highlight the significance of QRUs as promising candidates for learning models that can be conveniently deployed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware."

Simulation results indicate that reconfigurable TFETs maintain significant tunneling barriers in the OFF state and narrow tunneling barriers in the $O N$ state, unaffected by temperature variations. While the ON -state current improves with rising temperatures, elevated temperatures introduce challenges such as increased leakage currents and ambipolar behavior. Additionally, subthreshold swing improves at lower temperatures. Reconfigurable TFETs demonstrate potential in mitigating random dopant fluctuation limitations; however, further optimization is required to address temperaturedependent leakage currents and enhance operational parameters for ultra-scaled devices."

    "abstract": "Traditional complex event processing (CEP) systems focus on extracting information out of simple events in the input event streams to detect complex event patterns. In the context of CEP, a computing unit that executes a complex data transformation task is called an operator. Typically, a CEP system consists of an operator graph that could be distributed over the cloud-edge continuum. However, an operator graph distributed over heterogeneous nodes comes with its own set of challenges. In fact, the nodes of an operator graph are typically subjected to dynamically changing workloads. Unbalanced load distributions across heterogeneous nodes may lead to processing overloads in individual operators that do not have enough resources to properly adapt to an increasing workload. As a result, a framework that can detect and adapt to dynamically changing workload in real time across the various nodes of the cloudedge continuum becomes paramount. To this end, the goal of this work is to propose a new extensible self-adaptive CEP framework with load regulatory features that help operators continue working even in face of an overload, thus facilitating the deployment of operators in a heterogeneous and/or resourcelimited environment."

At racing speeds, aerodynamic effects, tire slip and grip, and heat accumulation significantly alter dynamics, making control a challenging task under high model uncertainty and limited knowledge of vehicle behavior. This paper addresses this challenge using the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) framework. A path-planning strategy based on camera perception generates reference signals for two parallel ADRCs: one regulating forward velocity and the other controlling ego-vehicle heading. The controller was developed for the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) on the Dallara AV-21 platform and validated using the official IAC simulator, Ansys VRXperience, which replicates both vehicle dynamics and sensor suites. The proposed approach leverages the disturbance estimation and rejection capabilities of ADRC and its Extended-State Observer (ESO), requiring only minimal model information. Testing on the simulator shows that the controller achieves consistent performance at speeds up to 70 m/s (157 mph) on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, demonstrating its robustness for realistic high-speed autonomous racing scenarios."

    "abstract": "As the feature size of integrated circuits (ICs) continues to shrink, lithographic hotspots have become a critical challenge in IC design and manufacturing yield. Consequently, Lithography Hotspot Detection (LHD) at the post-OPC stage has garnered significant attention, aiming to identify potential patterning failures before transferring designs onto silicon wafers. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated superior performance in detecting previously unseen hotspot patterns, offering faster and more accurate detection compared to traditional methods such as pattern matching. However, existing DL-based approaches typically rely on centralized training, where all hotspot and non-hotspot data must be aggregated on a single server. This assumption is increasingly unrealistic, as semiconductor manufacturing companies are often unwilling to share sensitive layout data with third parties due to privacy and intellectual property concerns. This reluctance to share data is one of the primary reasons for the limited availability of updated benchmark datasets, with only ICCAD 2012 and ICCAD 2019 publicly accessible to date. To address these challenges, we propose a federated learningbased hotspot detection framework, which enables multiple design companies to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their local data. This approach bridges the gap between data privacy requirements and the need for generalizable models that can support LHD across diverse sources. Our work pioneers the application of federated learning in the semiconductor manufacturing domain. We evaluate our approach against a centralized training baseline. Experimental results show that federated training achieves performance comparable to centralized training in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and balanced accuracy-highlighting its potential for real-world deployment in privacy-sensitive IC design environments."

    "abstract": "Crosstalk remains a major source of correlated error in quantum systems, yet lacks a precise, community-wide definition - hindering systematic analysis and mitigation. This paper introduces a model-driven approach to crosstalk characterisation through three architecture-inspired noise models: (1) simultaneous two-qubit gate execution, (2) shared qubit interference, and (3) proximity-induced noise from shared control or readout hardware. These models act as both diagnostic tools and building blocks for crosstalk-aware quantum programming. We assess their impact across a broad benchmark suite - quantum simulation, Grover's algorithm, and fault-tolerant primitives like surface, Shor, and Steane codes - and evaluate two mitigation techniques: dynamical decoupling and Pauli twirling. While both are discussed in literature, only dynamical decoupling consistently enhances fidelity across noise types. Our work links low-level noise effects to high-level software engineering, underscoring the role of hardware-software co-design in scalable quantum computing. Model-based, hardware-aware design flows and composable noise abstractions improve error mitigation and program portability. Integrating such strategies into the toolchain is essential for building resilient quantum programs under realistic noise conditions."

The proposed framework is based on the incorporation of a quantum overlay network on top of the classical network infrastructure, which can be incrementally expanded in alignment with technological advancements, market demand, and available investment. Central to this approach is the concept of an intermittent quantum IQ network, wherein only a subset of network links is quantum-secured, forming a spatially intermittent quantum network (sIQ network). Furthermore, the selection of such links can change over time, leading to the realization of a space-time intermittent quantum network (stIQ network), offering flexibility and scalability in the deployment of quantum communication technologies."

    "abstract": "Endometrial Cancer (EC) is one of the common types of uterine cancer and continues to be a significant cause of cancer-related illness and death. Advanced-stage of EC often exhibits limited responsiveness to treatment. Current diagnostic methods for EC are expensive, time-intensive, and not universally accessible. In order to avoid this, an automated system for segmentation of tumor is required for early diagnosis which will benefit the patients and radiologists. The automated model enables faster and more accurate detection of uterine and tumor regions in MRI scans, which can assist radiologists in identifying EC at earlier stages. In this work, automated model is developed for segmentation of uterine and tumor using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 136 images of sagittal T2WI images, Axial Diffusion-Weighted Image (DWI), and axial T2 - weighted image (T2WI) which is divided into stage IA and IB. Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) based segmentation techniques is used for segmenting uterus and tumor. ML segmentation techniques include Otsu segmentation, region growing, and edge detection. CNN based segmentation is done using U-Net architecture and Visual Geometry Group (VGG) 16 as its backbone. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was employed to quantitatively assess the overlap between the segmented uterine and tumor regions. On the test sets, the trained model achieved average DSC of 96.4% and 91.8% on axial T2WI, 95.2% and 91.5% on axial DWI, 96.1% and 89.7% on sagittal T2WI for the uterus and tumor regions respectively. Therefore, DL based segmentation better results than ML based segmentation techniques. Incorporating additional imaging modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Computed Tomography (CT) could provide a more comprehensive view of the tumor and surrounding tissues, leading to more accurate segmentation and better treatment planning."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel combination of constraint encoding methods for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Ansatz (QAOA). Real-world optimization problems typically consist of multiple types of constraints. To solve these optimization problems with quantum methods, normally, all constraints are added as quadratic penalty terms to the objective, which expands the search space and increases problem complexity. This work proposes a general workflow that extracts and encodes specific constraints directly into the circuit of QAOA: One-hot constraints are enforced through <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$X Y$</tex>-mixers that restrict the search space to the feasible sub-space naturally. Inequality constraints are implemented through oracle-based Indicator Functions (IF). This paper focuses on the numerical benchmarks of the combined approach for solving the Multi-Knapsack (MKS) and the Prosumer Problem (PP), a modification of the MKS in the domain of electricity optimization. To this end, we introduce computational techniques that efficiently simulate the two presented constraint architectures. Since <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$X Y$</tex>-mixers restrict the search space, specific state vector entries are always zero and can be omitted from the simulation, saving valuable memory and computing resources. We benchmark the combined method against the established QUBO formulation, yielding a better solution quality and probability of sampling the optimal solution. Despite more complex circuits, the time-to-solution is more than an order of magnitude faster compared to the baseline methods and exhibits more favorable scaling properties."

    "abstract": "The improvement of quantum computing technologies relies on the reduction of flux noise that contributes to decoherence. Recent work has shown that the majority of flux noise is due to impurities and defects on the surface of the qubits [1], [2]. Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a prime candidate to detect these defects, but lacks the sensitivity and ability to provide information on the physical location of the defects. We report upon ESR measurements utilizing a non-resonant probe integrated within a semiconductor wafer probing station which could be used to detect paramagnetic defects believed to contribute to flux noise in quantum devices. Our approach greatly enhances ESR's sensitivity and provides a high spatial resolution on the surface of unaltered fully processed wafers and devices at room temperature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to detect defects on the surface of materials with a spin sensitivity improvement of roughly $10,000 × compared to classical ESR. The integration of a non-resonant probe into a standard semiconductor wafer probing setup has already been shown to be able to obtain a 2D map of unpaired spins on the surface of samples [3]. The technique offers a pathway for characterization of the defects which contribute to flux noise, which would provide critical insight into reducing decoherence mechanisms."

Moreover, we explore two strategies for transmitting quantum information between superconducting nodes via optical channels, with a focus on the impact of quantum transduction on the transmission process. The performance of these strategies is analyzed and compared through simulations conducted using SeQUeNCe. Our results align with theoretical predictions, offering simulation-based validation of the strategies and providing a path to accurate, larger-scale simulations of heterogeneous quantum networks."

This presents a novel integrated machine learning approach named Hybrid Feature Optimized Random Forest (HFORF) to improve stroke prediction accuracy. This methodology is driven by statistical feature selection and metaheuristic optimization. HFORF actively chooses the most significant demographic and clinical characteristics with a two-stage strategy—mutual information ranking first, then optimization with the Grey Wolf Optimizer—whereas conventional methods use static datasets and linear classifiers. A Random Forest classifier chosen for its stability and interpretability is trained with the features. The model outperforms the classifiers in a test on a publicly available stroke dataset with 95.6% recall, 96.3% accuracy, and 94.8% precision. The findings demonstrate that the HFORF approach offers a drastic improvement in the reliability of stroke predictions and can be useful for actual clinical decision support systems."

    "abstract": "Ethereum has adopted a rollup-centric roadmap to scale its network while preserving both security and decentralization. Rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that process transactions off-chain while posting summarized data on-chain to maintain security and reduce costs. Posting data on-chain remains expensive, which led to the introduction of blobs via EIP-4844 that offer a cost-effective solution for data availability (DA). Although blobs significantly reduce DA costs compared to traditional calldata, many cost-sensitive small rollups struggle to fully utilize the fixed blob capacity. Blob sharing, which allows multiple rollups to collaboratively utilize a single blob, has been proposed as a solution to these challenges. In this paper, we empirically analyze nearly six months of data to assess the effectiveness of blob sharing. Our simulation results demonstrate that blob sharing can lower overall costs by approximately $\\mathbf{8 0 \\%}$ to 99%. These findings imply that the benefits of blob sharing are even greater than initially expected, providing strong incentives for both small and big rollups to actively collaborate in its adoption."

In this paper, the application of rotation-invariant image classification models in recycling robots is explored. A transformer-based model, called RIFormer, is utilized to address this limitation. RIFormer is compared with state-of-the-art models like MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and Vision Transformer (ViT) to evaluate its effectiveness in recognizing rotated images at various angles, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of recycling robots. The models were trained on the Augmented TrashNet Dataset, containing 10,000 samples, over 100 epochs. Experimental results demonstrate that RIFormer achieves a superior accuracy of $97 \\%$, significantly outperforming other models, which fail to exceed $92 \\%$. Additionally, RIFormer exhibits robustness against rotations, unlike its counterparts. This demonstrates that rotation-invariant models like RIFormer are more suitable for practical robotic applications."

However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures.

The implementation of precise, localized control fields is critical to minimizing gate errors and cross-talk between neighboring qubits. In our theoretical work, we explored the use of nanomagnets and divergent and convergent magnetic skyrmions to generate a control field capable of manipulating spin qubits with high fidelity. Skyrmions, which resemble 3D hedgehog structures, offer advantages in standard semiconductor processes due to their 2D nature. Our simulations show that skyrmion configurations can provide gate fidelities above 99.9 % for singlequbit gates, while significantly reducing cross-talk in neighboring qubits compared to proximal nanomagnets. Expanding on this theoretical foundation, we experimentally demonstrate coherent quantum control of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond using microwave fields from a nanoscale magnet, driven by a surface acoustic wave in lithium niobate. We observe highcontrast Rabi oscillations and control over the Rabi frequency by varying acoustic power. This approach, based on nanoscale magnets, provides a pathway to highly localized, energy-efficient quantum control and could replace thermally noisy microwave circuits, contributing to the scalability of quantum computing and sensing with NV defects and other spin qubits."

However, future deployments in both high-performance computing (HPC) and embedded environments will demand tighter integration for lower latencies, stronger determinism, and architectural consistency. We propose a vertically integrated quantum systems architecture that treats quantum accelerators as peripheral system components. A central element is the Quantum Abstraction Layer (QAL), introduced at the kernel level of the operating system. This design enables real-time, low-latency, and high-throughput interaction between quantum and classical resources and opens the door for robust scheduling, resource management, and cross-stack optimisation. Kernel-space integration is not merely a technical curiosity—it is a necessity. For HPC, it enables scalable, heterogeneous workloads; for embedded systems, it provides a foundation for future quantum deployments far beyond scripting-based control interfaces. We present early-stage results including a virtual QPU model integrated into a QEMU-based prototype system. The architecture is validated through functional emulation and time-accurate FPGA simulations, enabling realistic evaluation of hybrid system performance and quantum advantage scenarios. Our work lays the groundwork for a system-level co-design methodology tailored for the next generation of quantum-classical computing."

    "abstract": "The use of virtual machines in cloud data centers has become the de facto architecture for hosting AI applications. As these applications increasingly process vast amounts of data and interact with the physical world, ensuring the integrity of their underlying computing environment, specifically, the operating system kernel, becomes essential. To address this, we propose an integrity monitoring system for guest VM kernels. Our approach leverages virtual machine introspection and utilizes Volatility3 [1] to map the kernel modules. The monitor transparently inspects the OS kernels of all VMs on a server. Experimental results show that it enhances kernel security with minimal performance overhead on the host."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum linear solvers offer a promising direction for accelerating extreme scientific computations such as fluid dynamics. However, the deep and complex circuits required by many quantum algorithms limit their practical use on current quantum hardware. The Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) presents a viable alternative for near-term quantum devices (NISQ), and initial efforts have explored its application to select fluid dynamics problems. In this work, we evaluate the use of VQLS for canonical fluid dynamics problems, aiming to identify pathways for generalizing its implementation across a broader class of systems. We analyze the impact of various circuit ansatz and classical optimizers on solution quality and convergence behavior. Furthermore, we assess the algorithm's feasibility within a hybrid quantum–high-performance computing (HPC) framework by porting it to QFw, a state-of-the-art quantum-HPC software stack. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US Department of Energy (DOE).

AI applications span investment management, risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service, with predictive analytics and automation driving measurable improvements. For instance, AI-powered pattern recognition strengthens investment decisions, while advanced risk models enable more accurate detection of loan defaults and credit risks. Similarly, AI chat-bots and virtual assistants provide round-the-clock customer support, significantly improving user experience. Despite these opportunities, the adoption of AI in finance presents pressing challenges. Concerns around data security, privacy, and the lack of transparency in deep learning– driven decision-making raise critical questions of trust, accountability, and regulatory compliance. This paper contributes by systematically examining the applications, benefits, and limitations of AI in financial services, highlighting the trade-offs between innovation and governance. Our findings emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary framework that integrates technological innovation with robust regulatory oversight and ethical safeguards.

We present a hardware-maturity probe that quantifies a device's reliability by testing whether it can repeatedly reproduce the provably global optima of single-layer Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits. Using harmonic-analysis techniques, we derive closed-form upper bounds on the number of stationary points in the p=1 QAOA cost landscape for broad classes of combinatorial-optimization problems. The bounds yield an exhaustive yet low-overhead grid-sampling scheme whose outcomes are analytically verifiable. The probe integrates reliability-engineering notions-run-to-failure statistics, confidence-interval estimation, and reproducibility testing-into a single, application-centric benchmark. The proposed method links analytic guarantees to empirical performance and supplies a standardised dependability metric for hybrid quantum-HPC (QHPC) workflows."

Traditional recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering and content-based methods struggle with cold-start issues and limited adaptability. In this work, we systematically evaluate four reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Q-Learning, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-Learning (DQN), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) on the Microsoft News Dataset (MIND). The recommendation task is modeled as a sequential decision-making process, where the RL agent optimizes long-term engagement through adaptive policy learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the TD3 algorithm achieves superior performance, with 95.1% accuracy, 93.2% precision, and 92.5% F1-score, outperforming the other approaches in terms of stability and reward maximization. The contributions of this study include: (i) a comparative benchmark of RL algorithms for news recommendation, (ii) formulation of a TD3-based framework tailored for continuous decision-making in recommendation tasks, and (iii) empirical evidence highlighting TD3’s effectiveness in mitigating overestimation bias and improving recommendation quality. These findings establish TD3 as a promising direction for building scalable, adaptive news recommender systems."

As industries across the continent call for urgent solutions to bridge this persistent skills gap, research has increasingly turned its focus to academic institutions, seeking ways to better align engineering education with industrial expectations. This study investigates how African higher education institutions can enhance the competencies of engineering graduates to produce industry-ready professionals. Using a qualitative, literature-based methodology, over 22 peer-reviewed articles published mainly between 2014 and 2024 are analysed through the lenses of Distributed Cognition and Cognitive Apprenticeship, applying thematic and critical discourse analysis to explore power dynamics and institutional influences on graduate preparedness. The research produces a bespoke industry-readiness template, detailing key qualities and institutional strategies needed to align graduate skills with technological and industrial realities. Emphasis is placed on fostering learning environments that support technological adaptation, experiential learning, and collaboration with industry partners. Ultimately, the study advocates for standardized curricula aligned with Engineering Education 4.0, ensuring African graduates emerge as competent, confident, and resourceful engineers ready to contribute to local and global innovation."

The spatiotemporal synchronous acquisition and distributed processing of fault information are realized through edge computing terminals, and a local and global fitness function model based on binary coding is constructed. By utilizing immune selection operators to dynamically adjust the concentration of particle populations and combining nonlinear mutation mechanisms to enhance the algorithm's global search capability, the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm's tendency for premature convergence is solved. The simulation experiment is based on the IEEE 33 node distribution network model, and the experimental results show that the algorithm improves the convergence speed by 50% compared to the BPSO algorithm. The average positioning accuracy in noisy fault scenarios reaches about 92.5%, and the accuracy is improved by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20 \\sim 30 \\%$</tex> compared to the BPSO algorithm.

However, charge noise remains a major challenge since it causes timedependent drifts in qubit frequency and exchange interactions through electric field fluctuations. These drifts in control parameters are one obstacle to achieving the high-fidelity quantum operations required for quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for the adaptive calibration of quantum gate parameters in silicon qubits. In addition, to address the impact of charge noise, which exhibits a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 / f$</tex>-like power spectral density, we incorporate a forgetting mechanism into the Gaussian process model used during optimization. Our simulations on a realistic silicon quantum dot system show that BO-based method improves gate fidelity by 0.266% and reduces calibration iterations by 36.9% compared to random search. Compared to standard BO, our modified method achieves a further fidelity gain of 0.008% and a 9.23% reduction in iterations. These results highlight the potential of BO-based calibration for robust quantum gate implementation under realistic noise conditions."

    "abstract": "Bosonic quantum computation harnesses the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators, offering scalable architectures with inherent error correction advantages over qubit-based systems. Despite their potential, bosonic modes encounter significant challenges from prevalent noise sources, particularly photon loss and dephasing, which degrade quantum coherence. Among bosonic error-correcting codes, the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code stands out for its ability to correct small phase-space displacements, enabling applications in quantum communication, sensing, and computation. While ideal GKP states require infinite squeezing and are unphysical, the finite squeezing approximate GKP states have been experimentally realized, though their performance depend critically on the squeezing level and measurement strategies. This work addresses a central challenge: how to optimize the squeezing parameter of approximate GKP states and the local oscillator (LO) phase in homodyne detection to maximize precision in estimating bosonic loss-dephasing channel parameters. To address this question, we introduce an adaptive optimization framework guided by classical Fisher information (CFI) and quantum Fisher information (QFI). Numerical simulations demonstrate that this adaptive protocol consistently converges to optimal parameter configurations, determining optimized squeezing levels and LO phases. By offering a practical approach to highprecision quantum channel parameter estimation, this framework has broad implications, from quantum metrology to enabling robust quantum communication systems."

    "abstract": "Surface defects in the printed circuit boards (PCBs) manufacturing process can affect product quality, thereby compromising the stability and reliability of the equipment. The ambiguity of defect boundaries and the insufficiency of annotated samples severely limit the detection performance of defect detection models. To address the above challenges, a semi-supervised segmentation network named EGCR-Net is proposed, which leverages a feature enhancement module and a cross-attention mechanism to enable effective multi-scale feature interaction under limited sample conditions, thereby improving the accuracy of solder defect segmentation. First, a memory module is introduced to store normal features and support anomaly comparison, thereby alleviating the problem of limited annotated samples. Second, a boundary-enhanced prompt (BEP) module is designed, which uses the Laplace operator to enhance the edge response of blurred defects. Third, a cross-region focus (CRF) module is proposed, which uses a cross-attention mechanism to capture long-distance context dependencies. The latter two modules work together to optimize the localization of defect boundaries, effectively addressing the detection challenges posed by blurred boundaries. We constructed the SolderPCB dataset, covering seven common solder defects, to evaluate real-world performance. The dataset will be publicly released after being organized. The experimental results show that EGCR-Net performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods in welding defect detection tasks and has been successfully deployed in automated PCB inspection lines to achieve quantitative detection of solder joint defects. In a real industrial environment, this method achieves an accuracy rate of 99%, effectively meeting standardized measurement requirements."

Satellite networks provide global coverage but face stringent transmit power constraints due to limited onboard energy and long-distance propagation. Low-resolution Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) can reduce terminal complexity, yet their coarse quantization introduces nonlinear distortion that conventional power allocation cannot effectively handle. This letter develops an analytical model and proposes a quantization distortion-aware power allocation algorithm for OFDM-based satellite IoT downlink using low-resolution ADCs. Leveraging Bussgang decomposition and Price theorem, we model quantization distortion and derive an upper bound on the ergodic achievable rate. Based on this bound, we propose a power allocation algorithm combining the Lagrangian multiplier method and gradient projection, subject to total transmit power and spectral constraints. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal ergodic achievable rate with more stringent constraints compared to general optimization method. This work provides a resource-efficient framework for large-scale satellite IoT connectivity."

This work presents an optimized planning strategy and an efficient algorithm for the Next Best View problem in occluded environments. Two novel optimization heuristics, a geometry heuristic, and a visibility heuristic, are proposed to enhance search performance by selecting optimal camera viewpoints. Comparative evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings reveal that the visibility heuristic achieves greater performance, identifying over 90% of hidden objects in simulated forests and offering 10% better detection rates than the geometry heuristic. Additionally, real-world experiments demonstrate that the visibility heuristic provides better coverage under the canopy, highlighting its potential for improving search and rescue missions in occluded environments."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the security allocation problem in a networked control system under stealthy injection attacks. The networked system is comprised of interconnected subsystems which are represented by nodes in a digraph. An adversary compromises the system by injecting false data into several nodes with the aim of maximally disrupting the performance of the network while remaining stealthy to a defender. To minimize the impact of such stealthy attacks, the defender, with limited knowledge about attack policies and attack resources, allocates several sensors on nodes to impose the stealthiness constraint governing the attack policy. We provide an optimal security allocation algorithm to minimize the expected attack impact on the entire network. Furthermore, under a suitable local control design, the proposed security allocation algorithm can be executed in a scalable way. Finally, the obtained results are numerically validated through using Erdős-Rényi random graphs for generality."

This paper introduces <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LearnRouter</i>, a dynamic reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm designed to improve the message delivery ratio while minimizing end-to-end delay in opportunistic networks. Existing routing protocols use static strategies or fixed replication schemes, leading to resource utilization and high message drop rates. LearnRouter addresses these challenges by incorporating the multi-armed bandit framework and utilizing the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to make more intelligent and data-driven forwarding decisions. The proposed approach enables the protocol to adapt continuously to network changes while balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. The simulation results show that LearnRouter surpasses end-to-end delay and message delivery ratio in comparison with Direct Delivery, Spray and Wait, CBR, SimRouter, RL-Prophet, and K-DQLR in opportunistic and dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Reproducibility and comparability remain fundamental challenges in the empirical evaluation of Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) tools. These challenges arise from the intrinsic probabilistic behavior of quantum programs and the variability introduced by quantum hardware and simulator backends. While existing quantum benchmarks typically offer only static circuit definitions, they often leave researchers responsible for data generation and execution, hindering the creation of standardized and reproducible experiments. In this paper, we introduce QSimBench, a novel, open-source benchmark suite and accompanying Python library designed to address these limitations. QSimBench provides over 20 million precomputed shot-level execution traces: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 0, 0 0 0}$</tex> measurements each, across <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 4}$</tex> quantum algorithms, multiple circuit sizes (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4-15$</tex> qubits), and six Qiskit-based backends including both ideal and noise-injected simulations. Each configuration includes not only detailed measurement histories but also the original circuit in OpenQASM, the backend's noise model, and configuration metadata, ensuring full transparency and enabling in-depth analysis. QSimBench empowers researchers to conduct scalable, reproducible, and statistically rigorous evaluations of QSE tools, such as those for monitoring, orchestration, and statistical post-processing, without the need for expensive or difficult-to-reproduce quantum executions. The benchmark is distributed with a lightweight Python API that facilitates fast data retrieval, flexible sampling strategies, and seamless integration into experimental pipelines. QSimBench is publicly available, aiming to foster collaborative and reproducible research within the quantum software community."

Our approach utilizes quantum-inspired superposition and entanglement to create a more nuanced and dynamic trust evaluation framework. We present a simulation-based validation of this approach, demonstrating three key advantages: (1) enhanced granularity in trust representation through superposition of multiple trust states, (2) improved modeling of trust relationships through emergent correlation from quantum-inspired entanglement, and (3) better adaptability to complex trust scenarios through dynamic trust evolution. While our system conceptually supports a multi-dimensional trust framework, the current implementation models trust as a single quantum-inspired state per entity, with multi-dimensional extensions discussed as future work. Our simulation results show that the system effectively maintains stable trust scores for normal behavior, rapidly detects security threats, and models trust relationships between entities, making it a promising solution for modern Zero Trust environments."

The known diagnostic methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and nucleic acid amplification tests are costly, time-consuming, and require trained professionals. Due this in some cases it is inaccessible in many regions. Deep learning-based automated TB detection offers a promising alternative by enhancing diagnostic efficiency through medical imaging analysis. This study presents a comparative evaluation of five deep learning models, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet, VGG16, ANN, and a custom CNN, trained on a dataset of $\\mathbf{3, 0 0 8}$ chest radiograph images, evenly distributed between TB-positive and normal cases. The dataset underwent advanced preprocessing techniques, pixel normalization, and data augmentation. The hyperparameter tuning process was applied, which optimized the learning rates, dropout rates, convolutional filter sizes, and batch sizes to enhance model performance. The models were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity.. Experimental results indicated that the custom CNN achieved the highest classification accuracy (99.51). The superior performance of the custom CNN over other models is attributed to optimized feature extraction, effective preprocessing, and structured hyperparameter tuning. A comparative analysis with previous studies highlights how this approach mitigates dataset limitations and improves model interpretability, and the potential of AI-driven TB detection, enhancing future diagnostic efficiency by improving model generalizability and deployment in real-world healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "Blockchain networks provide a reliable trust anchor to decentralized applications (DApps) backed by smart contracts. The Ethereum ecosystem now encompasses most blockchain networks that provide compatible support for smart contracts code. Recently, many Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) rollup solutions emerged, meant to scale the base Layer 1 (L1) network, consequently decreasing transaction fees and diversifying the usage scenarios. Furthermore, the number of blockchain providers that offer access to the network infrastructure for both L1 and L2 continuously increases. A developer is faced with a multitude of deployment options and must weigh between the gains in costs and the losses in trust that are still an issue with L2. A decisive factor in this trade-off can be the use case itself, depending on its security requirements. Still, the evaluation of costs and performance cannot be ignored and should rely on set of measurable metrics, although choosing the right metrics can be complicated. In this practical experience report, we explore the relevance of several such metrics in choosing between different providers and rollups. For this purpose, we perform evaluations for two use cases of DApps: a voting DApp with high security demands, suited for L1 deployment, and a cost-sensitive supply chain DApp, where L2 can be an option. We analyze a set of basic metrics by comparing these between two highly used access providers, Alchemy and Infura, for the L1 deployment case, and between two of the most popular rollups, Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet (Optimism), for the L2 deployment scenario."

As these visualizations play an essential role in simplifying complex datasets, the need for automating their analysis and explanation has grown significantly. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal tasks, excelling in bridging visual and textual modalities. However, their application to the domain of data visualization interpretation remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comparative analysis of three fine-tuned VLMs, evaluating their ability to comprehend and generate descriptive insights from graphical data. Three state-of-the-art VLMs were fine-tuned to enhance their capability to interpret and generate descriptive insights from these visualizations. Leveraging advanced techniques to systematically adapt the models to this specialized domain and evaluate their performance using quantitative metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and BERT score. Our findings underscore the potential of VLMs to automate the textual interpretation of data visualizations. This research contributes to advancing multimodal model learning by demonstrating the adaptability of VLMs to nontraditional visual data, paving the way for applications in automated reporting, accessibility tools, and educational platforms.

Depending on the error mitigation mechanisms adopted to suppress loss and errors, QRs are typically classified into “memory-based” or “all-photonic” QRs, and each type of QR may be best suited for a specific type of underlying quantum technology, a particular scale of quantum network, or a specific regime of operational parameters. Modeling and simulation of quantum repeaters and networks can help in understanding the relative performance and resource requirements of different types of QRs, identify tradeoffs of alternative quantum network architectures, optimize quantum hardware, and assist in the design of a robust control plane. This paper introduces a quantum repeater simulation toolkit based on NetSquid, which includes component models and protocols to study advanced quantum repeater networks. We present our initial research findings on modeling and simulation of “allphotonic” entanglement-based QRs and “memory-based” first generation trapped ion QRs. We study the relative performance and resource requirements of these two different types of QRs and networks. The performance metrics include entanglement generation rate and fidelity between the endpoints of the network. For fair comparison of resource requirements of different types of QRs, entanglement generation rate is normalized by the total number of matter qubits involved."

Within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) contexts, monitoring attention during various learning tasks has been identified as a critical factor influencing academic outcomes. Although prior research has demonstrated the utility of electroencephalography (EEG) for assessing mental states, the application of low-cost, portable EEG devices for concentration monitoring in educational environments remains limited.This study aimed to examine the feasibility of using EEG signals recorded from a Muse 2 Headband to distinguish between tasks requiring different levels of concentration. A total of forty-one participants completed a series of digital tasks while EEG data were collected. The dataset was processed and analyzed using three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and KNearest Neighbors. The objective was to classify concentration versus non-concentration states based on EEG features and selfreported focus levels. The Random Forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy, outperforming comparable methods and supporting the validity of using the Muse 2 Headband as a real-time, cost-effective tool for concentration assessment in HCI-driven educational scenarios. These findings suggest that portable EEG devices may serve as effective instruments for tracking concentration in hybrid learning environments. Their integration could offer timely feedback to students and educators, contributing to improved academic performance. Future work will explore multimodal approaches by combining EEG data with other physiological signals to enhance the robustness of concentration assessment models."

We propose a general measure-and-prepare approach to realize this extension, which allows a quantum gate to be excised from a circuit significantly more efficiently than by cutting all the wires surrounding the gate, leading to exponential savings in classical computational cost with respect to the number of wires involved. As an application, we employ this framework for the classical simulation of near-Clifford quantum circuits by excising non-Clifford gates from the circuit and efficiently simulating the remaining Clifford subcircuit in polynomial time. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the prior wire-cutting technique in emulating near-Clifford circuits."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of noisy electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in emotion recognition by introducing a unified, end-to-end denoising and classification framework that operates across both frequency and time domains. First, we design an Adaptive Frequency Filter (AFF) module that learns to suppress spectral noise while preserving emotion-relevant frequency components; this filtering is performed as an integral layer within the neural architecture, ensuring seamless gradient-based optimization. To further refine temporal signal integrity, we incorporate a two-layered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) denoiser: the first LSTM layer captures coarse temporal dependencies and removes bulk noise, and the second layer targets finer residual artifacts, thereby enhancing the sequential features fed to the classifier. To guide the network toward both classification accuracy and parsimonious frequency utilization, we propose a novel Multi-Objective Learning Loss (MOLL), which combines label-smoothed categorical cross-entropy with an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{1}$</tex> - based regularization on the learned frequency mask-encouraging sparsity and robustness across emotional states. We validated our approach on the widely used WESAD, SWELL and SEED emotion datasets, performing better in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines. We tested our model on different devices and found that it can run in real-time, with inference times as low as 22 ms on GPUs and under 130 ms on edge devices like Raspberry Pi 5, making it suitable for real-world emotion recognition applications.

This estimation is combined with a filtered Smith predictor to compensate delays introduced by signal processing during phase acquisition. Control strategies, including a typical baseline and the proposed predictive controller, are implemented and evaluated in MATLAB/Simulink on a real-time platform employing software-defined radios and a microcontroller-based data acquisition system. Experimental results show superior performance of the combined estimation and prediction framework in terms of steady-state error, noise attenuation, and tracking precision.

In contrast to conventional approaches that either estimate only position or rely on expensive sensor configurations, the proposed method enables a reliable estimation of both the AMR's position and heading angle using only distance measurements from two tags to fixed anchors. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its strong potential for practical applications in indoor environments."

Centralized solutions to DDoS detection are hampered by scalability, latency, and privacy issues, requiring decentralized and smart solutions. Federated Deep Learning (FDL) has emerged as a viable paradigm, facilitating collaborative model training without revealing raw data. This paper introduces a systematic case study-based investigation of FDL in IoT DDoS detection with a focus on its applications, challenges, and implications. We examine various case studies from a range of IoT environments industrial IoT, smart homes, and critical infrastructure and analyze how FDL is effective against developing attack patterns. Critical issues including heterogeneous data distribution, adversarial robustness, communication overhead, and real-time adaptability are examined and some solutions discussed. Our results reflect the excellence of FDL in providing high detection accuracy with maintained privacy and scalability. We also present future research directions in combining blockchain, reinforcement learning, and quantum computing to provide immunity to FDL-based DDoS detection systems. This research is a worthy reference for researchers as well as practitioners in promoting next-generation intelligent and decentralized IoT security architectures."

    "abstract": "One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum computation is the use of quantum error correcting codes. The majority of popular codes are stabilizer codes, in which error information is extracted via the repeated execution of a set of commuting stabilizer measurement circuits and then decoded. Just like every other quantum circuit, these circuits must be compiled to hardware in a way to minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example either due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity limitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits, all syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example they have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting subcircuits, and have a set of ancilla which are indistinguishable between measurement rounds, among others. For the most part, compilation methods have aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on the hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and result in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular trapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of excessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit interactions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the structural regularity of quantum error correction code physical circuits, with the primary objective of minimizing circuit latency from shuttling operations. Our compiler's success is predicated on several key observations: 1. only ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be executed in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a per-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to begin a stabilizer measurement and since only ancilla are shuttled, we retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles, and 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the number traps in the system bounding the rate of stabilizer measurement meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be easily reused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.38 \\times$</tex> faster to execute (by up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.24 \\times$</tex>) and therefore incur lower physical error. For codes with good decoders, e.g. the color code and surface code, these improvements lead to up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates."

Among these, ResNet demonstrated the highest accuracy, making it the most effective model for disease classification. The research also suggests appropriate treatments for diseased leaves and recommends suitable pesticides for healthy plants. In addition, class-wise performance variations were observed, highlighting the challenges of distinguishing visually similar diseases.

    "abstract": "Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) has emerged as a promising research direction. Since the introduction of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), numerous variants have been proposed to enhance its performance. QAOA was later extended to the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+), which generalizes the initial state, phase-separation operator, and mixer to address constrained problems without relying on the standard Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation. However, QAOA+ often requires additional ancilla qubits and a large number of multi-controlled Toffoli gates to prepare the superposition of feasible states, resulting in deep circuits that are challenging for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, VQAs are generally hindered by issues such as barren plateaus and suboptimal local minima. Recently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a groundstate preparation algorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE has demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has been applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as MaxCut. In this work, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained optimization using VarQITE. We show that VarQITE achieves significantly lower mean optimality gaps compared to QAOA and other conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that scaling the Hamiltonian coefficients can further reduce optimization costs and accelerate convergence."

    "abstract": "Quantum chemistry is a key target for quantum computing, but benchmarking quantum algorithms for large molecular systems remains challenging due to the lack of exactly solvable yet structurally realistic models. In particular, molecular Hamiltonians typically contain <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$O\\left(N^{4}\\right)$</tex> Pauli terms, significantly increasing the cost of quantum simulations, while many exactly solvable models, such as the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard (1D FH) model, contain only <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$O(N)$</tex> terms. In this work, we introduce the orbital-rotated Fermi-Hubbard (ORFH) model as a scalable and exactly solvable benchmarking problem for quantum chemistry algorithms. Starting from the 1D FH model, we apply a spin-involved orbital rotation to construct a Hamiltonian that retains the exact ground-state energy but exhibits a Pauli term count scaling as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$O\\left(N^{4}\\right)$</tex>, similar to real molecular systems. We analyze the ORFH Hamiltonian from multiple perspectives, including operator norm and electronic correlation. We benchmark variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimizers and Pauli term grouping methods, and compare their performance with those for hydrogen chains. Furthermore, we show that the ORFH Hamiltonian increases the computational difficulty for classical methods such as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), offering a nontrivial benchmark beyond quantum algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the ORFH model provides a versatile and scalable testbed for benchmarking quantum chemistry algorithms under realistic structural conditions, while maintaining exact solvability even at large system sizes."

This paper discusses the integration of chaos theory with quantum mechanics in the development of robust algorithms for image encryption, considering the inherent vulnerabilities of classical approaches. We start with the basics of chaos theory and its implications in cryptography, emphasizing sensitivity regarding initial conditions and the unpredictability of chaotic systems. Then, we reviewed some of the existing quantum image encryption techniques and their limitations. Our analysis elucidates the potential of chaos-driven quantum algorithms for key generation and image scrambling to enhance security metrics such as key sensitivity, entropy, and unpredictability. We further discuss the performance of such algorithms in resistance against different attack vectors and their application domains, including healthcare, military, and digital rights management. The paper concludes by pointing out the directions of future research, hence calling for further development of sophisticated chaotic maps to integrate them into practical quantum image encryption solutions. The study points out that chaos-based quantum image encryption has strong potential to defend against evolving cyber threats."

The targeted competencies in the literature effectively shift the focus from individualistic, rationalistic view of engineer behaviours to the distributed influence from multiple actors on decisions that enhance or hinder ethical engineering. However, there is room to articulate and develop student competencies in synthesizing knowledge and recommendations regarding the impact of engineering, in order to inform decisions towards ethical engineering. To facilitate student reflections, improve the course, and examine the developmental journeys of engineering students completing a course in engineering ethics, an online survey was administered. Data included students' conceptualizations of an engineer's responsibility, descriptions of key motivators and expectations related to the being an ethical engineer, the descriptions of self-recognized changes that were most meaningful, the sequence of such changes and their connection to the course elements. As an example of using empirical data to test and ground the pedagogical assumptions and learning theories in engineering ethics education. Thematic analysis of perspective and ability changes point to potential threshold concepts unique to engineering ethics teaching and learning. Implications for teaching and further studies of threshold concepts are discussed."

This study investigates factors influencing career decisions among Japanese high school students, focusing on gender differences and the under-explored roles of digital media and family economic situation. A questionnaire survey conducted in 2023 with 107 male and 108 female students revealed significant gender disparities. Females showed a stronger preference for vocational schools and nursing fields, while males leaned towards science, engineering, and agriculture. Notably, female students were more significantly influenced by digital media (e.g., SNS, websites) for career research compared to males. Furthermore, household finances emerged as a more critical influencing factor for female students, with some citing economic reasons for their career paths or selecting public universities due to family financial burdens. Parental influence also varied, with mothers having a stronger impact on daughters, sometimes even dissuading them from STEM careers. These findings underscore the necessity of comprehensive interventions considering financial support, digital media's role, and gender attitudes within families and society to foster informed career choices, especially for promoting female participation in STEM fields."

The technique offers a low-cost, scalable, and portable alternative, suitable for resource-limited clinical settings. While the result suggests a promising alternative to traditional methods, variations in PPG signals and variability in datasets need to be further explored to make it more reliable. By minimizing these variables, this study assists in the development of efficient, AI-based, non-invasive blood typing technology, which can result in effective point-of-care diagnosis."

In today’s information era, the ability to comprehend and extract relevant data is crucial. Information Retrieval (IR) helps users find information matching their needs efficiently. Traditional keyword-based queries often fail to capture semantic meaning, leading to inaccurate results. Semantic queries, leveraging rule-based conversion, provide enhanced accuracy by analyzing relationships between words and concepts. This paper compares the accuracy of semantic query (rules-based conversion) and keyword-based query results in the Neo4j graph database, using Myanmar’s cultural heritage as a case study. The system, developed in PHP, integrates Stanford NLP for POS tagging, cosine similarity for pattern matching, and a structured rule set for semantic processing. The study evaluates 60 test queries, demonstrating a $99 \\%$ accuracy rate for semantic queries compared to $69 \\%$ for keyword-based queries. These findings highlight the benefits of semantic search over traditional keyword-based approaches, particularly for structured data retrieval in graph databases. The proposed approach is scalable for enterprise applications, supporting dynamic rule expansion and real-time query processing."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum architectures and computing have motivated the development of new optimizing compilers for quantum programs or circuits. Even though steady progress has been made, existing quantum optimization techniques remain asymptotically and practically inefficient. Because many global quantum circuit optimization problems belong to the complexity class QMA (the quantum analog of NP) [51], it is not clear whether efficiency guarantees can be achieved. In this paper, we present an algorithm that achieves efficiency by aiming at a form of local optimality rather than global optimality. Our local-optimization algorithm cuts a circuit into subcircuits, optimizes each subcircuit with the specified oracle optimizer, and melds the subcircuits by optimizing across the cuts lazily as needed. To prove efficiency, we show that, under some assumptions, the main optimization phase of the algorithm requires a linear number of calls to the oracle optimizer. Our empirical results show that our local-optimization algorithm can outperform existing optimizers significantly, by more than an order of magnitude on average. Perhaps surprisingly, the algorithm achieves these improvements without noticeable degradation in optimization quality. These results show that local optimization can be effective for optimizing quantum circuits."

For instance, an Authentication-based Medium Access Control (AMAC) protocol was proposed to ensure privacy and reliability in vehicular communications. Additionally, clustering methods have been employed to manage data dissemination effectively in dynamic vehicular environments. The current study advances these developments by proposing a novel data dissemination approach that leverages vehicle characteristics, trajectory estimation, and collision avoidance mechanisms. This approach is further enhanced by integrating 5G communication technology and implementing a multi-interface architecture with a best-interface selection algorithm. The use of the OMNeT++ simulator demonstrates that this combination not only improves data reliability and dissemination efficiency but also addresses potential single points of failure in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication.

The “memory wall” problem caused by the separation of computation and storage in the traditional von Neumann architecture has become increasingly prominent, severely restricting the performance and energy efficiency of neural network accelerators. As a novel non-volatile memory technology, Phase Change Memory (PCM) features high storage integration, low power consumption, and high-speed read/write capabilities, offering a new approach to addressing the aforementioned challenges. This paper employs the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model to conduct multi-dimensional performance tests between PCM and traditional DRAM architectures. The designed configurable convolution kernel module (fil_core) consists of four major components: multiply-accumulate operations, storage arrays, control logic, and accumulators. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the traditional DDR architecture, the PCM accelerator exhibits significant advantages in key metrics such as operation time and power consumption."

    "abstract": "The objective of this research is to devise a methodology to combine the electrical and mechanical test to enhance the sensitivity of the traditional mechanical test and check the protectability of a package to the chips. The inception of this research begins with the issue of the substrate (SBT) found dent cases that have the failure mode showing the BE (backend) package electrical test failure. The failure analysis shows the package has a dent on SBT and no package crack. However, the chip, which is presumed to be protected by the packaging, and the bottom die already exhibited a crack situation that resulted in the electrical failure. This means that the die crack is more sensitive to external force than the package crack, and the normal package strength test which tests the package and shows a crack, would not be suitable for simulating the real SBT dent failure cases, since the die will break prior to the package breaks although the dies are protected by package molding and SBT. Therefore, to simulate and check how the die is protected by the package rather than just check the package strength, a new method will be needed. To simulate the real failure mode, Ball-on-Ring (BOR) and Ball-on-Plate (BOP) tests were adopted in this work for inducing different stress types and be capable of doing the electrical test. Failure analysis and virtual simulation were applied to validate BOR and BOP to see which was close to the real failure and selected as the main evaluation method. In this study, an innovative method that combined physical and electrical tests was performed to investigate the package protectability to die based on the BOR and BOP methods. This novel method will help provide a quantitative result for estimation and assess the correlated issues on similar package products in the future."

    "abstract": "Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum algorithm for approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems by reducing instances of linear satisfiability to bounded-distance decoding over superpositions of quantum states. A central challenge in realizing DQI is the design of a decoder that operates coherently on quantum superpositions. In this work, we present a concrete quantum circuit implementation of DQI, with a focus on the decoding subroutine. Our design leverages a reversible Gauss-Jordan elimination circuit for the decoding stage. We analyze the circuit's depth and gate complexity and validate its performance through simulations on systems with up to 30 qubits. These results establish a concrete foundation for scalable implementations of DQI and open the door to future algorithmic refinements and hardware-level realizations."

    "abstract": "Solving NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization problems using quantum algorithms remains a challenging yet promising avenue toward quantum advantage. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), typically require constrained problems to be reformulated as unconstrained ones using penalty methods. A common approach introduces slack variables and quadratic penalties in the QUBO formulation to handle inequality constraints. However, this leads to increased qubit requirements and often distorts the optimization landscape, making it harder to find high-quality feasible solutions. To address these issues, we explore a slack-free formulation that directly encodes inequality constraints using custom penalty functions, specifically the exponential function and the Heaviside step function. These steplike penalties suppress infeasible solutions without introducing additional qubits or requiring finely tuned weights. Inspired by recent developments in quantum annealing and thresholdbased constraint handling in gate-based algorithms, we implement and evaluate our approach on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Experimental results show that the step-based formulation significantly improves feasibility and optimality rates compared to unbalanced penalization, while reducing overall qubit overhead."

    "abstract": "Brain and nerve-related cancers are one of the main death causes of cancer worldwide. The abnormal cell growth affects the functioning of the neurological system and it frequently creates severe health issues. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a commonly utilized approach for diagnosing these brain tumors, yet evaluating MRI by medical experts faces challenges because of variations in time constraints. It is more challenging to automatically identify the types of brain tumor due to the complexity of shape, texture, variability, size, and location of lesions. Classifying brain tumor types from the MRI is also crucial in conventional methods. Hence, an efficient deep learning-based classification scheme for the recognition of brain tumor types is implemented to solve these difficulties. The relevant MRI images are gathered from the relevant database, which provides detailed information on brain structures. Collected images are fed to the Region Attention-based Dilated DenseNet (RA-DD) network to categorize the brain tumors. DenseNet architecture helps in capturing complex patterns in MRI images of brain tumors. By integrating attention mechanisms and dilated convolution with DenseNet, the proposed model achieves higher classification accuracy for diverse brain tumor types. Finally, the classification performance of the implemented approach is evaluated and the capability of the classification approach is validated with existing baseline models."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the number one killers among cancer diseases, and it has barely been diagnosed early anywhere in the world. The most important factor for a patient’s survival is early and accurate diagnosis. Collaborative efforts between humans and AI, especially with the employment of machine learners and deep neural networks, have registered remarkable success in medical image analysis for lung cancer detection from CT scans. The paper outlines a deep learning model that relies on AlexNet (a famous convolutional neural network) to classify CT images of smoker lungs as cancerous or non-cancerous. In the suggested technique, after the images go through the preprocessing stage, i.e. including resizing and grayscale conversion, AlexNet then classifies them. Carrying out a set of parallel tests with Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and LightGBM were the classical machine learning models utilized. The gist of the experimental results which AlexNet achieved the highest accuracy of [insert value] % and the lowest error rate compared with other models is given. The human–AI systems like AlexNet are the perfect carriages for the action of faster, reliable, and non-invasive lung cancer detection. Moreover, the research highlights the synergy of human–AI as a leading force in cancer diagnosis and screening innovations."

We present a simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level, analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame, capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust. Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms."

The LAMP pruning algorithm is used to prune the model, removing redundant channel information, further reducing the number of parameters and computational load, and compressing the model size. Experimental results on the UPID dataset show that, compared with the baseline model YOLOv10s, the improved model achieves a 1.1% increase in the mAP50 metric, with the number of parameters reduced by 33.8% and the floating-point operations decreased by 67%. Therefore, this model is fully capable of meeting the practical application and deployment requirements for transmission line inspection."

    "abstract": "This tutorial provides a broad vision of artificial intelligence (AI)-native joint communication and computation for the sixth generation of wireless networks (6 G) and beyond, emphasizing the integration of AI into modeling, resource allocation, and decentralized management. We begin by revisiting traditional radio access network (RAN) architectures, cloud/edge architectures, and multi-cloud networks so as to establish the foundational system model of the networks under consideration. Building on this foundation, we define a joint communication and computation provisioning architecture for next-generation wireless networks. Focusing on multi-tier computing, we then explore how AI-driven decision-making enhances latency-sensitive applications across the cloud-edge continuum, by shedding light on timely multiple access mechanisms, e.g., rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (Co-NOMA). Such a cross-layer approach is especially poised to enable distributed intelligence, laying the groundwork for end-to-end AI in communication and computation. The tutorial afterward examines the synergistic benefits of AI-native hybrid networks, focusing on joint and distributed resource allocation schemes. The tutorial progresses from a single-cell deep learning framework for robust delay minimization to a multi-cell interference-limited setting, ultimately leading to a federated learning approach for distributed resource management. Throughout the tutorial, we provide comprehensive modeling, analysis, and optimization of the exemplified multi-tier networks, addressing their applications, enabling technologies, and the mathematical methodologies required for their systematic design. A major highlight of this tutorial is the crucial role of AI in spearheading joint communication and computation resource management toward seamlessly enabling future decentralized 6G networks and beyond."

    "abstract": "Laser fault injection (LFI) is known as the most powerful fault attack due to its high precision and repeatability. Building sensor circuits on IC chips is one of the promising countermeasures to protect assets inside the IC chips from LFI. We focus on digital LFI sensors that can be built using only logic circuits. Digital LFI sensors indirectly monitor analog quantities such as voltage and temperature, which are perturbed by laser irradiation, via the signal delay fluctuation, and it has the advantage that it's easy to design and calibrate since it's completely composed of digital circuits such as ring oscillators. While sensors are a promising approach to countermeasures, their evaluation against multiple fault injection is still immature. This paper proposes a disturbance concealment attack (DCA) on digital LFI sensors, which prevents digital LFI sensors from detecting attacks using a dual-spot laser. The DCA analogously cancels the signal delay disturbance of one LFI by using the second LFI. We experimentally demonstrated that the proposed attack reduces the laser detection rate of a digital LFI sensor to 26.6% and completely disables the sensor at some irradiation points. We also discuss the generality of the proposed method and its possible countermeasures."

    "abstract": "Quantum software testing is essential for the quality assurance of quantum programs. However, existing techniques face many challenges, such as constructing test oracles and distinguishing genuine faults from noise-induced errors. Propertybased testing is a promising solution for dealing with the test oracle issue, which verifies general properties rather than requiring inputs and outputs. However, its effectiveness in noisy quantum environments has not been studied. To this end, we evaluate the feasibility of applying property-based testing in noisy quantum computers by integrating it with a state-of-the-art machine learning-based noise mitigation method called QOIN. Our results show that on average, QOIN mitigates noise for individual circuits, though it may introduce outliers. Crucially, this does not guarantee property preservation: we show that some properties align better with QOIN, while others remain closer under unmitigated noise. To address this, we apply a hybrid approach that selectively applies QOIN during property-based testing. We show that this hybrid approach improves alignment with the ideal execution and significantly reduces false positives in assertion outcomes across most executed mutants. This provides a solid foundation for applying property-based testing to noisy quantum systems."

HVAC systems are responsible for indoor thermal comfort provision and indoor air quality provision but through their traditional control techniques—rule-based, and model-based control strategies that are not capable of addressing the complexity and dynamics of real building environments. The shortcoming of these approaches causes inefficiencies, excessive energy consumption, and suboptimal control performance. Introduce a model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method that combines a neural network-based system approximation with Model Predictive Control (MPC). Our approach learns the internal system dynamics of the HVAC system with a neural network and then applies MPC with a random-sampling shooting method to learn optimal control policies. With a learned model instead of direct interaction, our method dramatically decreases the number of training samples needed for convergence. In addition, impose safety constraints by limiting control actions to within pre-defined safe ranges and bounding rapid changes using prior knowledge to ensure stable and reliable system behavior. Validate our suggested method using Energy Plus, a widely used building energy simulation software, on a two-zone data center case study. Our findings confirm the feasibility of model-based reinforcement learning for intelligent HVAC control, with energy savings, enhanced efficiency, and enhanced safety on actual building applications."

Early detection is challenging due to dynamic water consumption, sensor uncertainty, and underground pipe networks. Machine learning has been widely applied for leak detection using two main approaches: feature extraction and deep learning. Feature extraction requires expert knowledge or trial and error, while deep learning demands large datasets, extensive training, and high computational resources. The wavelet scattering transform offers features for classification by producing a time-shift invariant and deformation-stable signal representation, reducing within-class variance. However, it can generate numerous coefficients, complicating classifiers, and lacks established parameter-setting guidelines. This work uses vibration data transformed via the wavelet scattering transform and selects features for water leakage classification in looped and branched networks. Two feature selection methods, oneway analysis of variance and minimum redundancy maximum relevance, were compared. The ten most important features from each method were trained on a support vector machine. Results show that variance-based selection yields higher accuracy for the looped network (88.75 percent), while both methods achieve 96.25 percent for the branched network."

The model has been written in Python and tested with the Intel Lab IoT Sensor Dataset. The proposed system has an average success rate in secure data encryption of up to 99.97 percent and acceptable percentages of bit error with tolerance limits on all packet lengths (1 KB and above) as depicted in experimental results, thus with low computation needs (3.2 ms encryption, 3.4 ms decryption) and moderate memory consumption (120 KB). The network performance analysis proves that smaller block sizes (5 KB) provide 245 Tx/s throughput using 0.2 J energy, thus, being utilized in real-time IoT operation. PBFT protocol achieves high levels of latency (90 ms) and finality (1.1 s) reduction than the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, and uses up to 96 percent less energy than PoW.

However, non-local communications between different quantum processors might significantly impact overall system performance. In this work, we investigate the role of the network infrastructure in modular quantum computing architectures, focusing on coherence loss due to communication constraints. We analyze the impact of classical network latency on quantum teleportation and identify conditions under which it becomes a bottleneck. Additionally, we study different network topologies and assess how communication resources affect the number and parallelization of inter-core communications. Finally, we conduct a full-stack evaluation of the architecture under varying communication parameters, demonstrating how these factors influence the overall system performance. The results show that classical communication does not become a bottleneck for systems exceeding one million qubits, given current technology assumptions, even with modest clock frequencies and parallel wired interconnects. Additionally, increasing quantum communication resources generally shortens execution time, although it may introduce additional communication overhead. The optimal number of quantum links between QCores depends on both the algorithm being executed and the chosen inter-core topology. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing modular architectures, enabling scalable quantum computing."

    "abstract": "Detection of targets for hyperspectral images (HSIs) persists as a fundamental task in remote sensing image processing. Exploring the discriminative ability of deep Siamese networks to distinguish targets from backgrounds is the mainstream method for target detection in HSIs. Nevertheless, these methods enhance the discriminative ability of networks by learning the separability distance between the target and the overall backgrounds, where the backgrounds are considered as a single category. As a result, they may struggle to effectively suppress backgrounds with solely subtle spectral differences from the target, resulting in a limited separability performance, and the inability to accurately detect the targets. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel subtle spectral difference discriminative deep metric learning-based target detector for HSIs (denoted as S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>D<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>ML) in this work.

While many predictive models have been developed, their generalisability across different courses and learning contexts remains limited. This study explores whether clustering techniques can enhance the performance and adaptability of predictive models in educational data mining. Using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), K-means clustering was applied to cluster courses based on behavioural, demographic, and academic features. Five machine learning models—logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, LightGBM, and support vector classifier—were trained both on the full dataset as a benchmark, and within each cluster. Cluster-based models consistently outperformed baseline models. The average AUC improved from 0.80 to 0.86 (+7.3%), and mean F1-scores increased from 0.66 (baseline) to 0.78 (best cluster-based model). The highest cluster-specific F1-score achieved was 0.88 using LightGBM. This improvement result from grouping courses with similar behavioural and demographic patterns, allowing models to learn context-specific risk factors more effectively. Clustering also uncovered distinct engagement profiles, such as consistently low activity, sporadic participation, and sustained high interaction, that enhanced model interpretability and allowed for more targeted identification of at-risk students. These findings highlight how segmenting courses by shared behavioural and demographic features can significantly improve both the performance and applicability of predictive models in diverse educational environments."

    "abstract": "Most existing emotion recognition studies rely on discrete stimulus paradigms under controlled laboratory conditions, failing to capture the inherently dynamic and transitional nature of emotional states encountered in real-world operational environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach for emotion transition recognition using multimodal physiological signal fusion. Thirty participants, including 10 licensed pilots and 20 non-pilots controls, were recruited to view 48 video stimuli de-signed to elicit six distinct emotional transitions. We introduce a two-stage progressive recognition framework to enhance performance in emotional transition modeling. In Stage I, differential entropy features extracted from EEG signals are integrated with Big Five personality traits to construct an occupation-based trait classification model, capturing cognitive-emotional patterns associated with occupational background and providing individualized priors. In Stage II, we develop the temporal spatial embed ding bidirectional cross-attention fusion network (TSE-BCAF), which employs parallel convolutional modules to extract deep spatial features from multimodal EEG and EOG signals. These features are fused via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to model inter-modal interactions, then processed by a Trans former-based temporal encoder to capture the evolving dynamics of emotional transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms unimodal and state-of-the-art multimodal baselines in both accuracy and robustness. The findings highlight the potential of our approach for real-world applications in aviation psychology and other high stakes domains requiring adaptive emotional regulation."

    "abstract": "Long-term unit commitment (LTUC) plays an important role in power system planning and production simulation, especially when seasonal volatility of renewable generation and ultra-long-term energy storage are taken into account. Solving LTUC exactly is challenging due to the large number of binary variables. This paper proposes a tractable method to obtain a near-optimal solution to LTUC with a guaranteed bound on its sub-optimality. The proposed method first constructs a lower bound by formulating a relaxed unit commitment (UC) problem in which binary variables are replaced by continuous ones, and a family of valid inequalities is introduced to strengthen the relaxation. A general framework for generating such inequalities is developed by exploiting the specific structural properties of single-unit operational constraints. Subsequently, by fixing the seasonal energy storage levels at the optimal solution of the relaxed UC problem, a feasible LTUC solution is constructed through sequential short-term UC optimization with look-ahead augmentation, which provides an upper bound for the true optimum. The sub-optimality is measured by the gap between the lower and upper bounds. Numerical tests demonstrate that the monthly or annual UC problems of practically-sized power systems can be solved on a laptop in hours with an optimality gap of less than 1.5%."

    "abstract": "In smart home services, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is critical for enabling efficient energy management and intelligent control. However, most existing NILM methods are limited to recognizing single appliances of the same type, with insufficient attention to scenarios involving the concurrent operation of multiple appliance types or multiple units of the same type. Moreover, publicly available datasets rarely support such comprehensive conditions, limiting progress in real-world applications. To address these challenges, this study proposes a comprehensive appliance load identification framework. An offset-overlay strategy is employed to simulate realistic usage patterns where multiple identical appliances are operated simultaneously by residents with similar behaviors, resulting in a comprehensive multi-type and multi-unit (CMTMU) dataset. A statistical mapping module is developed to enhance appliance sequence feature representation. Within the GCUNet encoder, a gated convolutional attention module is introduced to extract multi-scale features via down-sampling and residual learning. Finally, a hybrid model combining single-appliance state identification with correction and compensation algorithms is used for accurate appliance quantity identification. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improvements of 5.15%, 15.76%, and 14.72% in precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively, compared to existing approaches. This framework supports fine-grained load analysis and strengthens the applicability of NILM in practical smart energy systems."

    "abstract": "To move towards the utility era of quantum computing, many corporations have posed distributed quantum computing (DQC) as a framework for scaling the current generation of devices for practical applications. One of these applications is quantum chemistry, also known as electronic structure theory, which has been poised as a “killer application” of quantum computing. To this end, we analyze five electronic structure methods, including the unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD), unitary pair coupled-cluster doubles (UpCCD), unitary pair coupled-cluster with generalized singles and doubles (UpCCGSD), separable pair approximation plus generalized singles (SPA+GS), and local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansätze. The key benefit of these methods is that they can be found in common packages, such as Tequila and ffsim, that interface easily with the Qiskit Circuit Cutting addon. Herein, we highlight the challenges and aptitude of the aforementioned electronic structure methods for distribution using quasiprobability simulation with local operations (LO). The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework."

On hard benchmark sets with up to 20 knapsack items, we demonstrate our method's improved performance over the current state-of-the-art Copula-QAOA. However, for larger instance sizes, both approaches fail to deliver better outcomes than greedily packing items in descending value-to-weight ratio, at least for the considered circuit depths.

    "abstract": "This research presents a novel Deep Learning-based framework for evaluating movie theatres within a specific locality by integrating sentiment analysis of user reviews with environmental sensor data. The primary objective is to address the limitations of traditional theatre review systems that rely solely on subjective opinions, by introducing an objective, data-driven, and multidimensional evaluation mechanism. This system is significant in enhancing transparency, trustworthiness, and real-time monitoring capabilities for both customers and theatre management. Overall sentiment classification is achieved using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model, which captures the general polarity of user feedback, while a SpanBERT-based Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) model is employed to analyze sentiments on specific features such as seating comfort, snack quality, air conditioning performance, and cleanliness. Environmental quality is measured using a network of reliable sensors: the PMS5003 and MQ135 modules measure indoor air quality levels, the BME280 sensor captures temperature and humidity for assessing AC effectiveness, and sound pressure level meters monitor noise conditions within the premises. Cleanliness is assessed through image-based detection using YOLOv8 and cross-verified through textual review sentiments. A trust-weighted scoring mechanism is incorporated by evaluating review metadata such as length, verification status, and recency to give more weight to credible user inputs. The collected data from all modalities are normalized, scored based on ideal thresholds, and aggregated through a weighted formula to derive a comprehensive theatre rating. The system is rigorously validated using real-time sensor calibration and cross-validation techniques, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and actionable insights. This integrated approach offers a significant advancement in smart urban entertainment analytics and service optimization."

    "abstract": "We propose a new hybrid framework, using GWO and BWO together for improving machine learning models developed to predict shipping duration. After pre-processing the DataCo dataset, feature scaling was added, and missing data and outliers were eliminated. Several classifiers were used, such as KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. To fine-tune such models further, GWO was used for global exploration and optimizing parameters such as inventory allocation and transportation strategies, whereas BWO excelled at local exploitation, enhancing the precision of prediction. Hybridizing the GWOBWO optimizer balances the strengths of each to explore and exploit the given space when addressing multi-parameter dependencies within supply chain logistics. Experiment results showed substantial improvement in predictive accuracy and robustness over using a single optimization technique. A variant of GWO (RW_GWO) increased the accuracy of model trained using Decision tree from $90.32 \\%$ to $91.74 \\%$ by refining feature selection through random walks whereas IGWO increased the accuracy of model trained using Random Forest from 86.43% to 92% by identifying the most influential features, thereby boosting its accuracy. Additionally, the hybrid GWO-BOA optimizer further improved model efficiency by balancing global exploration and local exploitation. This kind of hybrid strategy is therefore scalable and adaptive, enabling advancements in predictive capabilities toward optimizing supply chain management for resource allocation and reduction of delays and inefficiency."

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multilayer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing highdimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints."

    "abstract": "Agriculture evolved as one of the world’s largest and most significant strategic sectors. In developing countries such as India, the global population is predicted to grow dramatically in the future years. Crops such as mango and sweet orange have a large economic and cultural impact on India. However, plant diseases are now a major global issue, producing food shortages in many countries. Plant diseases impair agricultural productivity and, if not diagnosed, can lead to food shortages, threatening global security and small-scale farmers’ livelihoods. Early diagnosis of such crops is critical for avoiding and controlling plant diseases, as well as making informed agricultural decisions. Identifying these diseases accurately is critical for enhancing agricultural production. Traditional agricultural disease detection methods are time-consuming, expensive, and frequently result in false diagnosis. There is a need for an automated approach to detect leaf disease. The emergence of deep learning algorithms has presented a possible solution to this challenge, as they have exhibited outstanding accuracy and efficiency across a variety of sectors. As a result, a deep learning-based method for detecting mango and sweet orange plant diseases is proposed in this work. The proposed system aims to identify plant diseases. It utilizes a dataset size of 50 leaf disease images from the Kaggle database, which are pre-processed by resizing for uniformity. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ResNet is then used to classify the leaf type, such as mango or sweet orange, and segment the images to detect abnormalities. Finally, the effectiveness of this system is evaluated by using parameters such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, MSE, and PSNR. The proposed system obtained an accuracy of 98.43%."

    "abstract": "Hybrid quantum-classical software systems are emerging as a practical means to exploit quantum computing within existing software stacks. However, such systems operate in highly dynamic environments, where quantum hardware fidelity, queue latency, and cloud costs fluctuate rapidly. Current Quantum Software Product Line (QSPL) approaches support design-time variability but lack mechanisms for run-time selfadaptation, limiting their applicability in operational contexts. This position paper aims to substantiate a Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) approach that enables run-time selfadaptation and automatic reconfiguration of hybrid quantumclassical software. The approach leverages solver-based multiobjective optimization to dynamically select configurations that balance fidelity, latency, and cost. We propose an explicit mapping of the DSPL components, run-time variability model, monitoring engine, and reconfiguration engine into the MAPE-K cycle. An illustrative scenario in the domain of logistics route optimization demonstrates the practical applicability of the approach. The example shows how the system continuously monitors operational metrics and adapts algorithm and back-end configurations to maintain service quality and cost-efficiency in response to environmental changes. The main implication of this work is that it serves as a preliminary foundation for run-time self-adaptation in hybrid quantum-classical software."

However, the heterogeneity in clients’ computational capacities poses significant challenges in distributed model training. One promising solution is knowledge distillation, which requires balancing global uniformity with client-level personalization. To address this challenge, we propose a federated collaborative learning teacher-student heterogeneous knowledge distillation framework coined FedColab. In our framework, students are matched with teachers based on knowledge distribution similarity, uniformization trends, and complementarity. Students improve their performance by learning from both their designated teacher and peer models, while teachers adjust their FL optimization process based on feedback from students, ensuring alignment with the collective student population. Experimental results demonstrate that the distillation mechanism in FedColab significantly enhances the performance of model aggregation in heterogeneous and distributed learning environments."

Globalization and the rise of e-commerce as well as technological advances have allowed the development of a profitable routing software market, which has recently attracted the attention of technology giants. Among the plethora of routing software alternatives, Google’s open source optimization suite, OR-Tools, looks particularly promising, providing a useful and affordable optimization tool for small and medium sized logistic companies and applications. The goal of this paper is to scientifically evaluate the accuracy, and performance of OR-Tools suite by examining the quality of its solution results in a set of capacitated vehicle routing problems with delivery time windows, also known as capacitated vehicle routing problem with time-windows (CVRPTW) or VRPTW. A comparative analysis is conducted by solving Solomon’s VRPTW problems for a small (25 customers), medium (50 customers), and large (100 customers) number of customers with OR-Tools and comparing the results with the known optimal solutions for a fixed maximum solution time and varied number of available vehicles. Additionally, in this paper we demonstrate a real case of application of the OR-Tool tools to a real problem concerning the online distribution of dairy products. But given the very nebulous definition of the online character of a problem, ORTool does not include online VRP algorithms. For this reason, we will convert the solution of the classic stationary VRP using OR-Tools into a solution for Online VRP."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Android devices has led to a surge in malware attacks, posing significant threats to user privacy and security. Traditional machine learning approaches for malware detection often require centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and may not be scalable given the distributed nature of user data. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, conventional FL methods like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) face significant limitations in communication efficiency, partial client participation, and non-convex optimization. These challenges result in increased overhead, unstable model updates, and reduced robustness, particularly in real-world applications like malware classification. In this study, we utilize a federated primal-dual optimization approach to enhance communication efficiency and model convergence in FL by leveraging the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Unlike traditional optimization methods for FL, ADMM is well-suited for solving non-convex composite optimization problems with non-smooth regularizers, making it robust to data heterogeneity and dynamic client participation. We evaluate our proposed method on widely used benchmark Android malware classification datasets (e.g. Malgenome, Drebin, and Tuandromd). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional FL approaches (e.g. FedAvg and FedProx) in terms of accuracy, F1 score, AUC score, and false positive rate (FPR)."

    "abstract": "A promising use of quantum computers lies in the logistics and scheduling of industrial problems, such as space mission planning, maritime management, and many others. This field is expected to provide useful applications for quantum computing at the current stage of hardware development. Quantum annealing techniques have been proposed to solve scheduling problems, along with many other optimization problems. In this work, we test quantum annealing and hybrid techniques based on the D-Wave hardware to solve scheduling problems in the framework of job shop scheduling (JSP), which consists of optimally assigning operations to certain resources, while satisfying specific constraints and minimizing the total scheduling time, known as timespan. We devised an iterative algorithm that produces valid schedules for decreasing timespan values. We implemented a refined iterative variable pruning technique, which significantly reduces the number of spin variables in the corresponding Ising model, whose low-energy configurations are sampled by using the D-Wave Hybrid Solver Service. Our novel iterative algorithm leverages a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of partial or complete solutions of the JSP instance, which enables an efficient update of the feasible processing time windows for each operation. This approach leads to significantly improved results compared to the standard state-of-the-art applications of quantum annealing for the JSP. Remarkably, we can often prove the absolute optimality of the obtained solution, namely that a more efficient schedule within a shorter timespan can not exist."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is advancing rapidly and thus is a major challenge to traditional schemes of cryptographies like RSA, and ECC that get their security on computational difficulty. In order to counter this challenge, a paradigm change to be proposed is quantum cryptography which is based on the application of the rules of quantum mechanics to a conditional security. In the paper, a design and implementation of an interactive simulation platform, which models two seminal quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, namely, BB84 and E91, is proposed. Formulated with a modular architecture in Streamlit, the system allows users to simulate the transmission into qubit, visualize key pre-processing, study the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and detect any eavesdropping through CHSH inequality. The platform will be used to include functionality of real-time graphical dashboards, user authentication, and a comparative analysis segment to systematically review classical and quantum-related cryptographic methods. The effects of noise levels, adversarial interference on the QBER and key generation rates are verified, and this serves to confirm the resilience of quantum systems against eavesdropping. The tool can be used as an educational and a research tool since it offers an intuitive interface to learn the quantum concepts related to superposition or entanglement and simultaneously takes the user through the protocol functionality in different security regimes. The findings attest to the increased security capabilities of quantum cryptographic systems, thus making them a valid option in the future communication network during the post-quantum era."

When it comes to SDN frameworks, the most significant obstacles are related to identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks. This article explores the use of Echo State Networks (ESNs), an algorithm specifically adapted for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments, to detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), in which the sequential data is processed efficiently that is very much needed to analysis the network traffic. The other conventional RNNs like simple RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Bidirectional RNNs are extremely slow and challenging to train because of disappearing or expanding gradient problem. To assess the ESN algorithm's effectiveness, expanded this approach by incorporating flow features designed to improve DDoS detection. Thoroughly examined this proposed DDoS detection method using various simulation parameters and compared its results against other algorithms. The ESN consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving better F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy values. Notably, it an impressive 97.78% average success rate, clearly highlighting its efficacy in identifying and preventing DDoS attacks. This research underscores the significant role ESNs can play as a cybersecurity tool, representing a considerable advancement in safeguarding SDN networks from DDoS threats."

Accurate and low-latency identification of quantum states is a critical enabler for scaling quantum computing, particularly as higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits are explored to increase information density, circuit depth, and gate expressivity. QubiCML integrates a lightweight, multi-layer neural network directly into FPGA hardware to classify the qutrit states <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\vert g\\rangle,\\vert e\\rangle$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\vert f\\rangle$</tex> with high fidelity and minimal latency. Traditional state discrimination methods rely on offline post-processing, resulting in delays incompatible with the short coherence times of superconducting qubits. QubiCML overcomes this bottleneck by performing all inference operations within the FPGA fabric itself, achieving full quantum state discrimination within 66 ns (with softmax) or 40 ns (without softmax). The system supports fast reconfiguration via BRAM-stored parameters, enabling compatibility with varying quantum hardware and dynamic calibration environments. Additionally, we propose FPGA-friendly techniques for data normalization and fixed-point quantization to eliminate the overhead of floating-point and division operations—further optimizing the architecture for real-time deployment. We evaluate QubiCML on in-house superconducting hardware across multiple qubits and qutrits. The system achieves up to 97 % average accuracy for qutrits and up to 99 % for two-level systems, using readout windows as short as 650-750 ns. These results establish QubiCML as one of the first practical implementations of real-time qutrit state discrimination, marking an essential step toward mid-circuit measurements, dynamic feedback, and advanced error correction in higher-dimensional quantum computing."

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly advanced architectures like U-Net, have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding capability in processing and segmenting medical images. In this study, an efficient approach for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images is proposed by leveraging transfer learning, the Superpixel technique, and introducing a novel layering scheme in the U-Net architecture. This method is designed to precisely identify complex boundaries and the irregular structures of tumors. The experiments were conducted using a publicly available and reliable dataset from Kaggle. Following data preprocessing, a semantic segmentation algorithm based on the U-Net model was employed. U-Net has become a popular choice in medical image processing owing to its advantages such as high accuracy, fast processing speed, and minimal requirements for large datasets or sophisticated hardware. By utilizing this model alongside transfer learning and modifications in the coding layers, the proposed method achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.67% in brain tumor identification. This level of accuracy surpasses that of similar studies in the field. The result shows high potential of this approach in improving early tumor detection precision and give more effective treatment for patients."

Its core employs a triangular mesh projection sampling mechanism: after calculating the projection boundary of the target mesh, sampling is performed according to resolution and field-of-view angle; depth is back-calculated via plane equations, and occlusion is resolved using a maximum distance criterion; to address multi-target edge depth aliasing, Canny edge detection is introduced as a quality control module for depth maps; a LiDAR noise model is concurrently incorporated to approximate real noise characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that this framework generates depth images with arbitrary target combinations, full pose angle coverage, high edge clarity, and multiple noise levels, exhibiting significant advantages over real data in enhanced scene scalability, precise parameter controllability, and rich sample diversity. It provides a standardized evaluation benchmark and large-scale controllable training data for LiDAR system optimization, image enhancement, and target recognition algorithms."

While capable network simulators exist to model such networks, connecting applications in development to these network simulators is non-trivial and existing solutions are not universally available on all computing platforms without having to port the entire application over to the network simulator platform. NSB - the Network Simulation Bridge - is a platform, application- and network simulator-agnostic open-source tool that allows researchers and developers to more easily integrate network simulation back-ends into their application front-ends, allowing for more holistic modeling of their systems. In this tutorial, we will provide an overview of NSB and its features and packages. We will cover its design, implementation and usage with two well-known network simulator backends - OMNeT++ and ns-3. Using step-by-step hands-on demonstrations, we will provide both high-level tutorials on quick and easy integration of applications with $O M N e T++$ and ns-3 network simulation using NSB’s helper packages and low-level tutorials on how to use the provided programming interfaces to manually integrate NSB into network simulation back-ends for more specialized use cases. Through this tutorial, our goal is to disseminate NSB to the distributed computing research and practitioner communities as a tool that will facilitate the development, testing and validation of distributed applications. NSB will allow researchers and developers of connected applications with various levels of experience in network simulation to more realistically observe the behavior and evaluate the performance of their distributed applications as they communicate using the underlying network."

Traditional detection methods, which rely on statistical analysis and classical machine learning, often struggle to generalize due to their reliance on handcrafted features. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-head Attention Distributed Denial of Service Network (MADDoSNet), a deep learning-based framework that leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to effectively analyze sequential network traffic and identify attack patterns. Multi-head attention enables the model to focus on multiple aspects of network behavior simultaneously, improving feature extraction and anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data. Following an extensive evaluation on the ISCX2012 dataset, the proposed MADDoSNet demonstrates superior detection accuracy compared to state-of-the art models. Key performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC confirm its effectiveness in distinguishing normal and malicious traffic. Moreover, we assess the computational efficiency of MADDoSNet, highlighting its trade-offs in terms of inference speed and resource consumption. Our findings underscore the potential of attention-based deep learning frameworks in cybersecurity, particularly in mitigating evolving network threats."

    "abstract": "Currently, an increasing number of workflow applications are being deployed in the public cloud environment. One of the most critical challenges for cloud service providers is to optimize the execution costs of workflows while simultaneously meeting the quality service requirements of users, such as security and deadlines. Nevertheless, prior research on the optimization of workflow execution cost ignored the importance of security and deadlines, which are actually essential for user satisfaction. This paper proposes a workflow scheduling algorithm (SACO) that aims to meet deadlines and security needs while also reducing execution costs, using a method inspired by ant colony optimization (ACO). In SACO, we propose a resource selection strategy that is both deadline and security-aware. This strategy involves the combination of idle time slots to select the most suitable resources for tasks in the task scheduling sequence. Furthermore, we design a method that reorders the task scheduling sequence by incorporating pheromone and heuristic information from tasks (such as probabilistic upward rank and security level). It aims to expand the search space and further reduce the costs of workflow execution. The results indicate that the SACO algorithm is generally superior to the comparison algorithms in terms of optimizing execution costs and meeting workflow deadlines."

    "abstract": "Gaussian states hold a fundamental place in quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum computing. Many subfields, including quantum simulation of continuousvariable systems, quantum chemistry, and quantum machine learning, rely on the ability to accurately and efficiently prepare states that reflect a Gaussian profile in their probability amplitudes. Although Gaussian states are natural in continuousvariable systems, the practical interest in digital, gate-based quantum computers demands discrete approximations of Gaussian distributions over a computational basis of size <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2^{n}$</tex>. Because of the exponential scaling of naive amplitude-encoding approaches and the cost of certain block-encoding or Hamiltonian simulation techniques, a resource-efficient preparation of approximate Gaussian states is required. In this work, we propose and analyze a circuit-based approach that starts with singlequbit rotations to form an exponential amplitude profile and then applies the quantum Fourier transform to map those amplitudes into an approximate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that this procedure achieves high fidelity with the target Gaussian state while allowing optional pruning of small controlled-phase angles in the quantum Fourier transform, thus reducing gate complexity to near-linear in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathcal{O}(n)$</tex>. We conclude that the proposed technique is a promising route to make Gaussian states accessible on noisy quantum hardware and to pave the way for scalable implementations on future devices.

    "abstract": "Failure analysis is a collective steps and procedures used to discover the root cause of a failed semiconductor integrated circuit (IC). Amongst the many challenges faced during failure analysis, 2 challenges will be highlighted as the objectives in this study. The first is to preserve the Nickel-plating layer on the lead finger during sample preparation for repackaging process. The current methods of using acid or laser tend to damage this layer which later hinders the ability for wire bonding during repackaging. For the second, the copper wires in a stacked-die IC tend to be damaged during Film Over Wire (FOW) removal with acid etching which causes the IC to fail electrical tests and disrupts the whole failure analysis work flow. With the methodology of using the Microwave Induced Plasma (MIP) system, the desired outcomes for both objectives could be produced with the predefined setting in the system which uses the mixture of oxygen and argon gas to form a plasma effluent that can selectively remove organic materials such as mold compound filler and polymeric materials but remains the inorganic materials such as metals. The novelty in this study is seen in the ability of the MIP to expose the lead fingers while preserving the condition of the Ni-plating layer for repackaging purpose and also seen in the ability to remove the FOW material completely while maintaining the copper wires connectivity in a stacked-die ICs. By achieving the 2 objectives, failure analysis can be continued without any obstacles and the root cause of the failures can be effectively addressed."

Here, we propose a novel implementation of CV-MDI-QKD that is tolerant to noise and channel loss across a broad range of operational conditions, where a fraction of the optical reference pulses, normally used for local local oscillator construction, is sacrificed for classical communication throughput. We demonstrate that our new protocol enables seamless inclusion of optical classical communication in satellite channels at surprisingly with minimal compromise to the quantum communication performance. Simulation results show that the cost of classical-quantum multiplexing to the QKD key rate as a function of the parameters in many settings is almost negligible. This trade-off implies that high-bandwidth classical communication can be achieved for “almost-free,” and further opens a scalable path for enhancements in the emerging quantum internet."

Existing methods typically establish 2D correspondences between query and template images at patch centers using ViT. However, these methods often yield inaccurate pose estimates due to deviations between patch centers and the projections of real 3D points. To address this issue, we introduce Feature Difference Guided Subpixel Matching for 6D Object Pose Estimation, a novel approach that: 1) models differences between the template and query images using a feature difference offset prediction module, leveraging local joint features; and 2) refines match locations via subpixel feature search within these regions, resulting in more accurate subpixel-level 2D-3D correspondences. Experimental results on seven datasets from the BOP benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing training-free RGB-based approaches and can be seamlessly integrated with rendering-based refinement methods, advancing the state-of-the-art in RGB-only 6D pose estimation."

    "abstract": "Online Social Networks (OSNs) have experienced significant growth in recent years, provides central platform for digital communication and social interaction. Although it’s popularity, OSNs raise serious privacy and security concerns, majorly when it comes to sharing personal information and perform profile matching. Although current OSNs allow users to restrict access to their data, they often lack mechanisms to address privacy concerns involving shared or intersecting data from multiple users. Some existing solutions attempt to facilitate user connections through shared attributes; however, these methods frequently expose sensitive profile information to unknown parties results in compromised user’s privacy. To resolve these limitations, a novel model proposed that incorporates neighborhood structures and introduces an asymmetric social proximity measure to more accurately capture the relationship between users. Building on this framework, two privacy-preserving matching protocols are designed that offer different levels of privacy protection while minimizing the risk of information leakage. The proposed protocols evaluated through rigorous analysis of computational and communication costs. In addition to this, it is validated using their effectiveness using real-world social network datasets and extensive simulations, measuring their performance in terms of computation overhead, communication complexity, execution time, and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that this approach offers improvement in privacy and efficiency compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "In recent years, subjective logic has gained significant attention for applications in reasoning under uncertainties. By explicitly considering the evidence in each statement or trust, it provides a second-order probability framework that also relates closely to the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Despite theoretical richness, its practical adoption remains limited due to the lack of efficient yet accessible implementations. However, lowering the barrier to the reproducibility of current research findings is key to boosting progress in applying subjective logic to solve contemporary questions. With this work, we present our novel eSLIM++ library, which aims to close this gap between state-of-the-art contributions to subjective logic and their application in real-world scenarios. The library's efficient C++ and CUDA-compatible implementation makes it suitable for evaluating large-scale and complex decision processes. Additionally, Python interfaces provide easy-to-use, low-barrier access that allows for rapid development and evaluation and provides comprehensive examples on a smaller scale. eSLIM++ is publicly available and open-source. It enables researchers and the community to extend its functionality and deploy subjective logic in modern applications such as object tracking and autonomous systems."

Beyond the challenges posed by hardware, their performance heavily depends on architectural and orchestration strategies, especially when supporting multiple concurrent jobs competing for limited resources. In this work, we address the problem of scheduling multiple quantum computing jobs within a hierarchical architecture. Job execution costs are modeled in terms of local and non-local gates, where non-local operations incur higher overhead due to higher overhead on network resources. We propose a constraint-aware, resource allocation algorithm. We evaluate job reordering heuristics—based on qubit count, circuit depth, and hybrid strategies—that improve scheduling efficiency. Simulation results show that strategic job ordering and resource placement can reduce overall execution cost."

Stabilizer codes belong to a large class of well-understood quantum codes that are crucially efficiently simulable on classical hardware using the so-called tableau representation. Popular simulation software like Stim exclusively studies and characterizes qubit codes, which entails repeatedly sampling a noisy quantum circuit with Pauli frames. We highlight the key differences (and fundamental similarities) between qubit and qudit stabilizer tableaus. It then teaches how Pauli frames generate batches of samples given a qudit tableau via two guided examples: one with a random measurement outcome but no noise, and one with a single noise gate."

Furthermore, advancements in drag-and-drop code-free AI tools, including Google Vertex AI, IBM Watson AutoAI, and DataRobot, have made AI model development more intuitive. The integration of generative AI has further streamlined model creation, allowing AI models to be built and optimized using natural language inputs, as demonstrated by tools such as ChatGPT API, OpenAI Codex, and Google Bard. Code-free AI tools have broad applications across various industries, enterprises, startups, SMEs, the public sector, and education. Notably, in the education sector, these tools enable educators, students, and administrators to integrate AI-driven solutions without requiring programming expertise, thereby enhancing accessibility and innovation. Despite their advantages, codeless AI tools face challenges related to limited customization for complex AI models, data quality and ethical concerns, and the high costs of cloud-based AI solutions. Future advancements in generative AI are expected to expand the capabilities of these tools, while more user-friendly interfaces will drive broader adoption among non-technical users. Additionally, enhanced AI regulations and ethical frameworks will contribute to greater reliability and transparency in AI models.

In this work, we present a routing protocol that takes into account this heterogeneity. While functional heterogeneity can be on several aspects, we divide the quantum computers and repeaters on a quantum network into two classes-those that can perform general-purpose quantum computing, including complex error correction routines and those that can only perform basic operations like entangled pair generation and Bell State Measurements. In terms of quality of service, we categorise the quantum nodes as per the probability of successfully, which we call the node reliability, executing a quantum operation and the expected time taken to do so. The routing protocol that we propose seeks to maximise the reliability of sharing EPR pairs between different nodes of a quantum network, with a minimum guaranteed threshold of fidelity and, optionally, a time constraint. We provide simulation results that indicate the effectiveness of the protocol in achieving these objectives."

It was created as part of an undergraduate research project conducted at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. A quantum channel is a mathematical model for noise in a quantum system that hinders quantum communication. A large number of mathematical properties of quantum channels are known, but these are often scattered across the literature. The Quantum Channel Zoo aims to consolidate this knowledge, providing a centralized and easily accessible resource for researchers. Each entry provides the channel's mathematical representations (Kraus operators, Choi state), key properties (entanglement-breaking, degradability), and references to primary literature. We will describe the pedagogical structure of the Illinois Mathematics Lab project that enabled undergraduate students with a background in linear algebra to engage with research literature at the frontier of quantum information science and synthesize it into a public resource. We will present the current scope of the database, including the types of channels documented and the mathematical properties catalogued. Finally, we will briefly discuss the project's technical implementation using ZooDb and its open-source accessibility on GitHub, and demonstrate how new channels can be contributed to the zoo. This talk should be of interest to educators seeking to involve undergraduates in active research as well as researchers in quantum information science who can benefit from or contribute to this evolving resource."

    "abstract": "Xenon+ plasma focused ion beam (Xe+ PFIB) delayering is gaining popularity for precise back-end copper metallization delayering in the Failure Analysis (FA) process. However, challenges with surface flatness remain, particularly in thick low-k (LK) interlayer dielectrics (ILD) and Vias. Conventional PFIB delayering methods using delayering gas (high copper etch selectivity) can lead to uneven etching rates between highdepth LK copper Vias and ILD, causing the copper Vias to etch faster and form over-etching holes. This can result in issues such as nanoprobing failure and metal short or open. The over-etch unevenness can affect up to few ultralow k (ULK) metal or Via layer when comparing the LK Via region to the LK non-Via region in delayering area, depending on the technology node. To address this, a novel methodology was developed that combines the PFIB delayering gas, tungsten (W) deposition and PFIB oxide etching gas in the PFIB system. This method uses a cycle technique to planarize the surface, improving evenness, reducing processing time and eliminating the risks associated with PFIB delayering gas over etching or lapping process overlapping. This paper will discuss the specific effects of using single PFIB delayering gas and oxide etching gas on thick LK copper Vias, LK ILD and ULK layers. Real FA case results will be discussed to highlight the efficiency of this method, demonstrating successful nanoprobing and comparing the benefits of PFIB with conventional parallel lapping on thick LK Via layers."

As such, understanding the capabilities and limitations of such models is becoming critical. However, the abilities of these models are typically measured using automated metrics that often only reveal a portion of their real-world performance. While, in general, the performance of NCMs appears promising, currently much is unknown about how such models arrive at decisions or whether practitioners trust NCMs' outcomes. In this talk, I will introduce doCode, a post hoc interpretability framework specific to NCMs that can explain model predictions. doCode is based upon causal inference to enable programming languageoriented explanations. While the theoretical underpinnings of doCode are extensible to exploring different model properties, we provide a concrete instantiation that aims to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations by grounding explanations of model behavior in properties of programming languages. doCode can generate causal explanations based on Abstract Syntax Tree information and software engineeringbased interventions. To demonstrate the practical benefit of doCode, I will present empirical results of using doCode for detecting confounding bias in NCMs as well as detecting code smells in the code generated by state-of-the-art NCMs, such as CodeLlama and Mistral. Finally, I will showcase results of our recent work on how causal inference can be used in the context of secure software engineering research."

    "abstract": "Human animation strives to bring static characters to life. Existing methods produce high-quality outcomes for single-frame animation; however, they often fail to maintain satisfactory temporal consistency, especially in facial and hand movements. This limitation arises from commonly used motion modules that do not explicitly model inter-entity relationships. In this work, we introduce MoAnimate, a Motion-oriented Human Animation framework designed to improve inter-entity consistency. Specifically, we extract motion flows from driving videos and transfer them to align the shape of character. During initialization, we propose a motion-oriented latent refinement that optimizes low-frequency subbands to regulate the layout of visual objects along flow trajectories, while preserving random high-frequency subbands to accommodate appearance variations. During denoising, we further introduce a motion-oriented entity attention module to enable direct and efficient interaction among entities within a coordinated subspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances temporal consistency, particularly the visual consistency of the entities."

    "abstract": "To overcome computational inefficiency, post-processing limitations, and weak generalization in conventional U-Nets for permanent magnet motor field prediction, this paper proposes an improved numerical U-Net model. The approach replaces the output sigmoid activation with a linear function and utilizes numerical 2D arrays instead of images to facilitate direct value extraction. Generalization is enhanced through a dual-path encoder structure incorporating a dedicated excitation input channel and Dropout layers, facilitating concurrent multi-angle predictions. Computational acceleration is achieved via optimized convolution kernels. Validated on Prius PM motor vector field data, the model demonstrates an 11% accuracy increase, training speeds 1.5 times faster, and prediction speeds 1.3 times faster than standard U-Nets. Additionally, it achieves an average flux density error of below 4%, with single-field computation speeds 15 times faster than those of finite element methods."

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the software engineering research community has increasingly focused on investigating the human and social aspects of the field. Not rarely, investigations on social aspects still raise controversial opinions on relevance and validity. Besides, it is no secret that sampling and recruiting human participants remain a cornerstone issue. Despite these obstacles, it is undeniable that shifting focus to human-centered investigations led the field to mature in qualitative research, also helping to bridge the gap between research and practice. More recently, the surge in Generative AI has significantly impacted software engineering research,accounting for a substantial share of scientific publications since 2023Ȕ although it has so far only timidly addressed qualitative research. In this keynote, we will engage in a bold yet smooth and open discussion about the current potential of Generative AI to support human-centered studies in Software Engineering, considering the different stages of the research process."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a parallel path following control scheme for cyber-physical maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) equipped with dual-podded propulsion systems. Specifically, an artificial MASS system is constructed using a deep neural predictor with a dual-time deep learning architecture, expanding the path following problem into the virtual space by integrating virtual-reality interaction. Then, based on information provided by the artificial MASS system, a parallel control law with integral action is formulated through computational experiments to ensure accurate tracking of the predefined path by the actual MASS. After that, the derived parallel control law is utilized to simultaneously drive the actual and artificial system during parallel execution. Stability analysis proves that the closed-loop control system is input-to-state stable, and all signals are uniform ultimate bounded. Notably, unlike the existing parallel path following methods that employ generalized forces as control inputs, the proposed approach directly regulates both of the rotational speed and pod angle, thereby enhancing the feasibility in practice. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for an MASS subject to environmental disturbances."

The received signals are coherently up-converted to the optical-domain using lithium niobate phase modulators. The up-converted RF signal is beamformed in a star-coupler PIC to instantaneously image angle-of-arrival to a single output channel that is amplified and input to an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) PIC, which instantaneously channelizes the RF frequency into increments of approximately 1 GHz. A switching scheme is used to calibrate the AWG as well as alternate between frequency and beam location measurement. This work implements these devices in a radiometer that can localize RF beams both spatially and spectrally with minimal latency and computational requirements. Future applications will include advanced wireless communications and sensing."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of wind energy systems into power grids has raised concerns related to power quality and stability, mainly due to harmonic distortions and reactive power compensation. This work introduces a novel Switched Filter Compensator (SFC) from the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices family, employing Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) switches and advanced Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control techniques. The proposed SFC is specifically designed to enhance the performance of Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) wind farms by mitigating power quality issues. The proposed work is tested and validated using MATLAB/Simulink software. The simulations show significant reductions in Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and improved power quality via varied load types, including induction motors, nonlinear loads, and R-L loads. The device’s versatility extends to maintaining stability under open and short-circuit faults and diverse load scenarios, making it applicable to real-world renewable energy systems. The proposed design offers superior adaptability, robustness, and efficiency in addressing power quality challenges, as evidenced by a comparative analysis with existing literature work, which highlights the filter’s advantages in mitigating harmonic distortions and stabilizing voltage. This study underscores the role of FACTS devices in enhancing grid stability and integrating renewable energy, paving the way for more resilient and efficient power systems. Results show a 42% reduction in reactive power, a 69% reduction in current THD, and around 10 ms recovery from grid voltage disturbances."

With the advent of quantum machine learning offering possible advances in computational power and latent space complexity, we notice the same opaque behavior. Despite significant research in classical contexts, there has been little advancement in addressing the black-box nature of quantum machine learning. Consequently, we approach this gap by building upon existing work in classical uncertainty quantification and initial explorations in quantum Bayesian modeling to theoretically develop and empirically evaluate techniques to map classical uncertainty quantification methods to the quantum machine learning domain. Our findings emphasize the necessity of leveraging classical insights into uncertainty quantification to include uncertainty awareness in the process of designing new quantum machine learning models."

First, we propose a global phase invariance operation which makes our architecture resilient to complex global phase shifts. Second, we demonstrate how augmenting data with small random unitary perturbations during training enables more robust learning. Finally, we show how encoding numerical data with techniques from image processing allow networks to better detect small but significant changes in data.

This study adopts a socio-cultural perspective to investigate evidence of infrastructural decay in African HEIs offering engineering training and explores how other institutions globally have addressed similar challenges. Using a qualitative, desk-based approach, the study applies the Technological Determinism (TD) framework divided into processes, people, structures, and culture to analyze literature and propose solutions. Findings will lead to a proposed technological transformation model, aligning TD components with key institutional reforms: structures as disruptive innovations, people as HEIs, processes as indigenization of engineering, and culture as engineering culture. The study concludes that transforming engineering infrastructure through a synergy of these interdependent components is crucial for improving educational quality and student outcomes across Africa's HEIs."

    "abstract": "Social responsibility in engineering is a vital aspect of the profession, encompassing ethical considerations and practical applications aiming to benefit not only humans but also all other life forms and ecosystems as well. This paper attempts to stress the importance of the social responsibility for engineers who play a great role in shaping the future of the world. This means how they should ensure the equitable distribution of technology, bridging the digital divide, and actively engaging local communities in project planning are crucial. In other words, they should move beyond mere regulatory compliance, demanding a proactive commitment to sustainable, equitable, and safe technological development. Though environmental education is already made mandatory as part of the education system in India, as mandated by the Supreme Court of India its effectiveness is still a question. Hence, as an alternative, integrating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within any curriculum offers multifaceted advantages for learners. By cantering curriculum design around global challenges like environmental issues, gender parity, and the fight against poverty, educators can craft lessons and activities that at the same time hone language proficiency and deepen awareness of critical world issues. This paper explores ways and means through which the SDGs are incorporated into the curricula for engineers and technologists, like the materials that may be used, making learners develop critical thinking processes and find solutions to the existing problems. Moreover, direct learning, interactive learning approaches such as group discussions, presentations, and projects empower students to investigate SDG-related themes and articulate their perspectives in their respective courses, fostering both subject competence and a sense of global citizenship. In this context this paper takes a case study in Indian context and analysis how the renewable energy is affecting an endangered species Great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) to extinction and in the process stresses the need for the engineers to have a holistic approach and in the process guarantee an environmentally sustainable ecosystem to all."

For this comparison, we utilize Quantum Annealing (QA), as implemented by D-Wave, and the conventional Simulated Annealing (SA) as a reference point for the capabilities of classical hardware with classical algorithms. The applications used for performance evaluation are two important benchmark programs designed to assess quantum hardware. This comparison is relevant because, for benchmarking purposes, it is valuable to have reference points between classical and quantum computing. It is widely thought that quantum computers will take some time to reach the level of relevance currently held by classical computing. This research, focusing on the Q-Score benchmark and Maximum Cardinality Matching (MCM) problems -both part of the MetriQs/BACQ benchmarking initiative- demonstrates this point. Through this work, we also trace the evolution from VA 2.0 to VA 3.0. While VA 2.0 already showed a significant advantage over both QA and SA in constrained problems, VA 3.0 introduces substantial optimizations and overcomes previous limitations in unconstrained problems. This advancement highlights the potential of VA 3.0. Furthermore, this work paves the way for the comprehensive testing of VA within the context of the MetriQs/BACQ quantum benchmark, an application-oriented French benchmarking initiative for quantum computers."

However, its performance can vary depending on the underlying quantum hardware architecture. In this work, we evaluate the performance of QAOA on different quantum hardware platforms, specifically, superconducting transmon qubits and trapped-ion qubits, targetting real-world optimization problems formulated as fully connected Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) instances. We evaluate both the solution quality and time-to-solution using dense QUBO matrices. Furthermore, we show that large-scale problems, such as a 100-bit QUBO instance, can be effectively tackled by integrating quantum computing with high-performance computing (HPC) resources. This study provides practical insights into the strengths and limitations of different qubit technologies and advances the application of quantum computing in solving real-world optimization problems."

When it comes to finding a defect, especially for IV curve that shows open, visual inspection will become the most important step and need to be done thoroughly to see if there is any presence of microcrack at the RDL metal trace. Smaller package size increases the difficulty of finding the defect using a high-power scope due to poor imaging resolution. In this paper, the inspection of RDL metal trace was done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The elimination of polyimide was carried out through the use of MIP by adjusting two things which are the oxygen flow rate and the number of etching cycles."

The primary objective is to assess the viability and performance of a low-cost visual system when integrated into a robot's control loop. The assessment involves comparing the visual servoing system's performance against that of a traditional controller with encoders in the loop to validate precision and consistency. The camera employed represents only 11% of the encoders' cost, reinforcing its potential as a truly low-cost alter-native for avoiding technological obsolescence from the encoders. The evaluated visual-servoing system is tested experimentally using LQR for set-point tracking, parametric robustness, and disturbance rejection. The results indicate that while visual-servoing control enables real-time operation, it remains more susceptible to latency and disturbances than controllers with encoders in the loop. Nevertheless, the visual system demonstrates promising adaptability for industrial automation, particularly in dynamic production environments -a crucial characteristic of Industry 5.0."

    "abstract": "Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) is a popular Model of Computation (MoC) for signal processing applications, thanks to its static analizability and provably deadlock-free execution. SDF compilers have traditionally prioritized static schedulers for their low runtime latency, particularly for signal processing and embedded systems. However, the conventional static technique of converting of multi-rate graphs to single-rate equivalents introduces scalability challenges through exponential graph growth and lost coarse-grained symmetry information. We revisit the idea of runtime scheduling for static dataflow and explore a tradeoff between latency, binary size and compilation time.Our approach introduces a specialized “quasi-dynamic” runtime scheduler and memory manager that leverages static topology information to precompute buffer sizes and allows out-of-order execution of actor firings, while thread assignment and memory allocation are handled at runtime through the OpenMP runtime and standard allocation primitives (malloc). By preserving multi-rate actor relationships, we avoid the node explosion inherent to single-rate conversion and improve the feasibility of SDF for a previously unreachable class of workloads. Comparative analysis of the current prototype against the Preesm static scheduler on the degridder radio astronomy application show, on average, 12.2x compilation time speedup and 4.4x smaller binary sizes, while only suffering 1.4x slowdown."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in distributed ledger technology (DLT) have produced novel systems combining high throughput, low latency and smart contract programmability. However, designing robust incentives schemes for such advanced protocols remains a critical challenge. Weaknesses in existing incentives schemes, particularly in reward distribution and incentive alignment, can hinder protocol adoption and long-term sustainability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for comprehensive analysis of a wide range of DLTs. Our framework extends existing methodologies for studying transaction fee mechanisms by incorporating reward distribution among multiple actors involved in the consensus process, addressing critical gaps in the literature. We introduce a categorisation of incentive mechanisms and apply the above framework to the modern consensus protocols of Sui and IOTA, offering comparisons with more ‘traditional’ systems including Ethereum and Bitcoin."

    "abstract": "This research studies the detection of epileptic seizures by the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a critical task in medical diagnosis that is greatly affected by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Epilepsy is a neurological condition that affects more than 50 million people worldwide, as reported by the World Health Organization. Epilepsy is consistent with the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which is “Good health and well-being.” This work uses machine learning-based Random Forest classifiers based on tuning parameters and deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network approaches to identify time-series data representations of EEG signals. The goal of this study is to find the best algorithm for handling structured and unstructured EEG data in the real world by comparing Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for EEG-based seizure detection. This study used publicly available epileptic seizure recognition data points from the UCI Machine Learning Repository of EEG signal time series. The preprocessed data fed to the classifiers Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Network, which achieved accuracies of 96.48 and 79.78, respectively. In terms of precision, recall, sensitivity, and accuracy, the RF classifier outperformed the CNN. These findings help to improve automated seizure detection, enhance clinical decision-making, and connect with SDG health goals. In the end, the study shows that traditional machine learning methods that work with structured EEG data are effective. It also shows that deep learning architectures need to be optimized to make them work better."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of quantum computing has provided a ground-breaking tool for solving problems that are insurmountable on classical computers. In the power system domain, quantum computing is still in the nascent stage, with limited but ongoing studies. The Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has been applied in solving several NPhard problems and can be further studied to address challenging problems in power systems. Key applications include contingency analysis, optimal power flow, and unit commitment, among others. With the significant integration of renewable energy, the intermittent nature of renewable energy introduces substantial volatility to the system. An overhead contingency analysis is required to evaluate the possible system outage scenarios, which will identify critical contingencies to maintain system stability. However, the contingency analysis is a prototypical NP-Hard problem, requiring substantial classical computation resources. In this work, QAOA is developed for the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N-k$</tex> contingency analysis on line contingency as well as the general contingency scenarios, with the aim of minimizing the shedding of the power load while ensuring the power flow constraints. A tailored objective function is developed to encode the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N-k$</tex> contingency condition as well as the power flow loss constraints into a problem Hamiltonian for QAOA computation. The developed method is verified on IEEE 9- and 14-bus systems compared with classical methods as the baseline. In addition, a QAOA parameter study including the number of QAOA parameters, the number of repetitions of the quantum circuits execution, and the number of iteration steps of the classical optimization algorithm, is conducted to offer insights for the parameter tuning under different problem sizes. This work is anticipated to establish a quantum framework for solving critical and complex power system problems in the Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era."

    "abstract": "In the digital era, governments are increasingly digitizing citizens' data, requiring secure mechanisms for data sharing across organizations and departments. Addressing vulnerabilities associated with centralized storage and third-party authentication servers, which are susceptible to attacks and misuse by malicious actors, a novel approach leveraging IPFS and Blockchain is proposed. This method eliminates reliance on centralized servers, ensuring security through decentralized storage and verification mechanisms. Data requesters generate private keys and encrypt multiple attributes before storing them in IPFS, with the resulting hash code recorded on Blockchain for verification. Data owners authenticate requesters by comparing hash codes stored on Blockchain, utilizing Blockchain's tamper-resistance, as any data alteration causes hash discrepancies, preserving data integrity. The system employs ECC for key generation and encryption, with an alternative lightweight algorithm, CHACHA20, proposed to optimize computational efficiency. To enhance authentication, address proof documents are integrated, and smart contracts coded in Solidity manage data storage and retrieval within the Blockchain. This solution provides a secure and efficient framework for government data sharing, mitigating risks associated with traditional centralized systems."

The proposed approach integrates style modeling and user preference control within a unified deep generative architecture, achieving a coherent combination of stylistic diversity, semantic consistency, and personalized expression. The model adopts an enhanced U-Net structure augmented with a style encoder and a user preference controller, and is trained end-to-end using adversarial learning and multi-objective loss functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the constructed ShortVid-Pref-500 dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics, including structural similarity, style consistency, video perceptual quality, and user preference alignment. In particular, significant improvements are observed in preference matching accuracy and naturalness of stylization. The results validate the model's adaptability and scalability in personalized short video generation tasks. This work not only introduces a structurally innovative framework but also provides a controllable and interpretable paradigm for creative video generation, expanding the frontier of generative multimedia content creation."

This work presents a methodological proposal based on the design and implementation of an adaptive controller using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), applied to 2RRR-type parallel manipulators with partially known dynamics. The strategy is based on the use of auxiliary variables to avoid explicit acceleration computation, and on the incorporation of leakage terms and sliding mode control to ensure the exponential convergence of estimation and tracking errors to a bounded set. As part of the analysis, a comparative scheme is developed between the classical controller and the proposed approach, evaluating their performance through metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation, over predefined trajectories. The experimental results show an improvement in the system's precision and robustness under perturbations, supporting the relevance of the adaptive approach over conventional schemes in fine tracking tasks."

In this paper, we generalize this probabilistic strategy to any commuting set of Pauli operators. To this end, we can leverage an algorithm that uses the tableau representation of Pauli strings to yield a unitary from the Clifford group that, under conjugation, simultaneously diagonalizes our commuting set of Pauli rotations. Furthermore, we fully characterize the underlying distribution of the random walk using stabilizer states and their basis state representations. This would allow us to tractably compute the lattice volume and variance matrix used to express the frame potential. Together, this demonstrates a scalable strategy to calculate the expressiveness of parametric quantum models."

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operate with discrete spikes, naturally aligning with temporal data and offering sub-milliwatt operation. Their accuracy, however, can collapse when spike timing is perturbed by sensor or environmental noise. We address this vulnerability with two innovations. First, this study introduces a Sensitive Noise-Threshold (SNT), a learnable variable firing threshold that adapts online to the local noise statistics, suppressing spurious spikes while preserving salient ones. Second, this study proposes the Limited Remote Supervised Method (LReSuMe), a lightweight gradient-free rule that supports online learning and enhances spike intensity at the target time. Compared with an equivalently-sized <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$400 \\times 10 \\text{ANN}$</tex>, the single-layer SNN in this study requires 18% fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) for inference (6610 vs 8029 FLOPs per sample) and 90% fewer FLOPs for weight update (1200 vs 12030 FLOPs per sample). Despite a marginal 5% drop in peak accuracy, the SNN is 52.79% more accurate than the ANN when 250 random pixels are corrupted, demonstrating a substantial robustness gain under severe noise conditions. These results, obtained entirely in software, indicate that the SNT + LReSuMe framework delivers robust, low-resource online learning; mapping the design onto an FPGA is left as ongoing work for energy-constrained vision sensors."

In this work, we extend the “Quantum Tree Generator” (QTG), previously proposed for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, to the 0-1 Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP) and the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP). The QTG constructs a superposition of all feasible solutions for a given instance and can therefore be utilized as a promising state preparation routine within amplitude amplification to produce high-quality solutions. Previously, QTG-based search was tested on the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, where it demonstrated the potential for practical quantum advantage, once quantum computers with a few hundred logical and fully connected qubits are available. Here, we evaluate the algorithm's performance on QKP and MDKP against the classical solver Gurobi. To facilitate large-scale evaluations, we employ an advanced benchmarking technique that enables runtime predictions for instances with up to 2000 variables for QKP and up to 1500 variables and 100 constraints for MDKP. Our results indicate that QTG-based search can produce high-quality solutions with competitive runtimes for QKP. However, its performance declines for MDKP, highlighting the challenges quantum algorithms face when tackling highly constrained optimization problems."

    "abstract": "This poster proposes an on-chip optical pulse modulation system for scalable superconducting quantum computers. Towards the scalable design, qubit control systems need to be located in the cryogenic environment to reduce the number of interconnections across the room temperature and the cryogenic regions. The cryogenic CMOS-based qubit control system is a promising approach, yet it is a bottleneck that exhausts the cooling capacity of the dilution refrigerator. In order to eliminate this bottleneck while providing the ability to control multiple quibits with a minimum necessary number of interconnections, this poster extends the RoF (Radio-over-Fiber) system where optical signals are directly fed from the Room Temperature (RT) region to a PD (PhotoDetector) mounted near the transmon qubit through low-loss and high-speed fibers. Unlike the conventional RoF system, the proposed system employs cryogenic silicon photonics-based modulators in the intermediate part for executing gate operations individually at each transmon qubit with a minimum necessary number of fibers across the RT and the cryogenic regions. Evaluation results show that the proposed system eliminates the power consumption by 79.5% compared with the cryogenic CMOS-based design. The proposed system achieves comparable gate fidelity to the control system generating fully customized RF pulses in the RT environment."

Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets—UCF-Crime (video), UrbanSound8K (audio), and TON_IoT (network)—establish UMTD-Net's state-of-the-art performance with 96.8% overall detection accuracy, 93.2% F1-score, and a decision latency of less than 55ms, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. The framework is also scalable to deploy at scale across edge-cloud infrastructures, and can be applied to real-time surveillance, public safety, and critical infrastructure protection.

Temperature and pH data are collected using temperature and pH sensors through Arduino, while the Raspberry Pi processes the data and performs image-based turbidity analysis using Laplacian variance techniques. The collected data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring. A fuzzy logic-based decision-making model evaluates deviations from optimal ranges 26– 33°C for temperature, 7.5–8.5 for pH, and turbidity thresholds based on image variance. When a deviation is detected in the processed data, the system automatically activates and notifies the user through email alerts (SMTP). This data-driven approach, integrating IoT, cloud computing, and intelligent decision-making, enhances aquaculture sustainability by ensuring early risk detection, reducing manual intervention, and optimizing resource utilization. The proposed system demonstrates the potential of AIoT-driven smart aquaculture, paving the way for scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable fish farming practices."

    "abstract": "Traumatic axonal injury is a key feature of diffuse brain trauma, often caused by structural failure in axonal microtubule bundles under mechanical stress. Existing models typically assume simple viscoelastic behavior and deterministic rupture thresholds, limiting their ability to represent biological variability and time-dependent damage. This study introduces an improved computational model that incorporates fractional-order viscoelastic damping and probabilistic rupture based on both strain magnitude and rate. A two-dimensional network formulation is used to simulate load redistribution and spatially heterogeneous failure, capturing rupture cascades across microtubule bundles. The enhanced model shows significantly greater energy dissipation and more realistic damage progression compared to the original model. It predicts nonlinear and rate-sensitive rupture patterns consistent with experimental findings. Simulation results across various loading conditions demonstrate the model’s ability to reproduce key features of microstructural damage, such as delayed failure onset, progressive degradation, and sensitivity to dynamic strain inputs. This work advances the modeling of axonal injury and offers a framework for more accurate prediction of brain tissue response under traumatic loading."

    "abstract": "As the semiconductor industry progresses toward Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), traditional failure analysis techniques are increasingly challenged to address subtle resistive failure mechanisms such as transition faults, bridging defects, and slow-to-rise/fall anomalies. Nano-probing (NP), an advanced technique combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with nanoscale electrical probing, has emerged to overcome these limitations. Among NP methodologies, Electron Beam Absorbed Current (EBAC) is widely employed for path-level local fault isolation, while Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (C-AFM) enables transistor-level fault localization. Stuck-at faults (SAFs), a dominant contributor to yield loss in modern semiconductor manufacturing, become increasingly critical as integrated circuits (ICs) grow in logical complexity and physical scale. Although SAF localization is typically achieved through Design-for-Testability (DFT) diagnostic tools, these tools only provide probabilistic identification of suspected nets and cells. This paper demonstrates the application of NP technology to SAF diagnosis through three case studies, highlighting its superior spatial resolution, quantitative defect characterization capability, and compatibility with DFT-guided workflows."

In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets in terms of classification accuracy and for regression, high <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex>-score and low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Furthermore, we evaluate the dual kernel model on both ideal and noisy quantum backends using the IBM Qiskit toolkit. Under ideal conditions, the dual kernel method consistently maintains superior performance compared to purely classical or quantum kernels. While the presence of noise may affect performance, the dual kernel still achieves results that are competitive with the best individual kernels, underscoring its robustness and practical viability in real-world applications."

Starting from simple Josephson circuits and progressing to full multimode qubit-cavity systems, we show how time-dependent modulation maps the dynamics to Mathieu-type equations, revealing thresholds for parametric resonances. Perturbative corrections capture effects like higher harmonics and weak nonlinearities. Simulations validate these predictions and expose sensitivity to fabrication parameters. These findings inform thresholds for readout fidelity, amplifier gain, and multi-qubit gate stability."

The effectiveness of the EKF method is tested in three scenarios, pulses of current and constant discharge.

Traditional detection approaches often fall short when it comes to handling diverse forgery types and lack the ability to provide meaningful interpretation of results. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive detection framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Multi-Frequency Feature Analysis and a Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection mechanism. The CNN component is responsible for identifying fine-grained texture anomalies, while the transformer architecture captures broader contextual inconsistencies across the image. A novel Multi-Frequency Feature Module (MFFM) is designed to harness both spatial and frequency domain information, improving sensitivity to subtle alterations. To enhance the system’s adaptability, especially to unseen forgeries, a Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection (SSAD) module is integrated to model natural image distributions without the need for extensive labeled data. Experimental evaluation on multiple publicly available datasets—such as DeepFake, FaceForensics++, and GAN-generated samples—shows that the proposed method outperforms existing solutions in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Additionally, the framework supports interpretability, making it highly suitable for practical deployment in detecting synthetic media content."

    "abstract": "Current sample preparation methods for decapsulation are limited to single-sided access. When the back side is decapsulation and sealed with a compound, it cannot be reopened for further analysis, posing challenges when both front side probing and back side electrical fault analysis (EFA) are required. Dual-sided decapsulation is necessary to address these cases. However, direct front side decapsulation after die pad removal leaves the die suspended, supported only by bond wires, which significantly increases the risk of sample preparation failure and may compromise the analysis. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes a specialized gel (Epoxy Bond 110) to stabilize the die during front side decapsulation, preventing structural risks. The gel is also transparent to infrared (IR) light, enabling circuit observation from the back side, facilitating dual-sided decapsulation. Despite the advantages, challenges arise during the gel application due to the need for heating. Improper temperature control or the presence of air bubbles within the gel can lead to uneven distribution, resulting in image distortion due to varying refractive indices. To address this, we propose applying the gel to a minimal area or outside the observation zone, ensuring die stabilization while minimizing imaging artifacts. This method reduces the risk of missing critical details and maintains imaging quality even in the presence of air bubbles."

    "abstract": "Conventional cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) signal identification frameworks require centralized aggregation of all subjects’ data for feature extraction, which inherently poses substantial risks of data privacy breaches. In response to this critical issue, the present study delves into the classification of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals with an emphasis on data privacy preservation. First, we design a federated learning framework (FedGF) consisting of a central server and multiple clients, where the server generates global features and coordinates distributed training across clients, while retaining subject-specific raw data locally to ensure privacy protection. Then, to enhance model generalizability, FedGF employs data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) to achieve knowledge transfer across clients through global feature learning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (Dataset 1 ‘session01’ and 2 ‘session02’) and one private dataset (Dataset 3) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline approaches, achieving performance improvements of 0.52%, 0.65%, and 0.53%, respectively. Finally, we develop a novel smart soft gripper with thermochromic capabilities and seamlessly integrate it with the trained network, demonstrating robust performance in daily grasping tasks.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has led to unprecedented data generation, necessitating a shift from traditional centralized computing to more decentralized approaches. To address the challenges of data processing closer to the source, the paradigm of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged. It facilitates task offloading to nearby edge servers, thereby reducing delay and enhancing privacy. However, limited computation resources at the edge necessitate intelligent resource allocation through effective scheduling to maintain Quality of Service (QoS). Typically, a task comprises multiple subtasks with inherent dependencies, some of which are locally dependent and unsuitable for offloading. In subtask scheduling, one must account for both inter-subtask and local dependencies, deploying different subtask types to near-optimal computing devices, whether edge servers or User Equipment (UEs). This requirement presents significant challenges to scheduling strategies. Furthermore, since task offloading requests are inherently online, without prior task information before their arrival, improper scheduling can result in resource wastage and increased delays. To tackle these challenges, we formulate the Online Multi-DAG task Scheduling with Dependency awareness (OMSD) problem within a DAG-MEC framework. This problem is modeled as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and proven to be NP-hard. We propose a Dynamic Priority List Scheduling (DPLS) algorithm to address this problem effectively. Our algorithm strategically determines subtask execution order by evaluating upward and downward ranks, task volume, and contention levels. Simulation results demonstrate that DPLS significantly outperforms existing benchmark algorithms regarding mean task completion time, server load balance, and maximum task completion time, offering a robust solution to the OMSD challenge in MEC environments."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel disturbance observer-based sliding mode control scheme with fixed-time convergence mechanism is proposed to regulate the output voltage of dc-dc buck converters. Firstly, to assure that the convergence time of the voltage tracking process is independent of the initial state, a new varying exponential coefficient fixed-time sliding mode controller (VECFxTSMC) is proposed in the outer loop of dc-dc buck converters. The designed varying exponential coefficient increases when the system trajectory is distant from the origin to improve the convergence speed and decreases when the system trajectory is near the origin to assure the robustness. Compared with conventional fixed-time sliding mode controllers (FxTSMC), the proposed one not only assures a fixed-time convergence of system trajectory but also further enhances the robustness and dynamic performance of the system without increasing chattering, thus the performance of buck converters can be further enhanced. Then, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FxTDO) is designed in combination with the proposed VECFxTSMC to estimate the unknown lumped disturbances and enhance the disturbance rejection ability of buck converters. Finally, a set of comparative experiments between conventional methods and the proposed method are implemented based on dc-dc buck converters, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy."

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence has shown great success in visual content synthesis such that humans struggle to distinguish between real and synthesized images. Forensic research seeks to reveal artifacts in such generated images, ensuring information security or improving generation capability. In this regard, the robustness and interpretability are important for the trustworthy purpose of forensic tasks. However, typical forensic models and their underlying data representations rely on empirical learning algorithms, which cannot effectively handle the high robustness and interpretability requirements beyond experience. As an effective solution, we extend the classical geometric invariants to the forensic research of large-scale generated images. Invariants are handcrafted representations with robust and interpretable geometric principles. However, their discriminability is far from the large scale of today’s forensic tasks. We boost the discriminability by extending the classical invariants to the hierarchical architecture of convolutional neural networks. The resulting overcompleteness allows for an automatic selection of task-discriminative features, while retaining the previous advantages of robustness and interpretability. From generative adversarial networks to diffusion models, the forensic with our boosted invariants demonstrates state-of-the-art discriminability against large-scale content diversity. It also exhibits high efficiency on training examples, intrinsic invariance to geometric variations, and better interpretability of the forensic process."

By prioritizing smaller, energy-efficient models for confident queries, HYBRIDSERVE reduces reliance on giant model replicas while preserving accuracy. A dataflow planner further optimizes model placement and replication to maximize throughput. Experiments show that HYBRIDSERVE reduces energy consumption by up to $19.8 \\times$ over state-of-the-art serving systems, while achieving the same accuracy as the largest model alone."

We consider PCA under the assumption that the high-dimensional data points are equipped with Gaussian uncertainty. Several approaches to such uncertainty-aware PCA have been developed recently in the visualization community. Since PCA is a discontinuous map, a small uncertainty in the data points can result in a huge uncertainty in the projected points. We show that the uncertainty of the data points also creates uncertainty in the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that defines the PCA projection. We present a closed-form expression to quantify eigenvector uncertainty. Based on this, we propose a 3D glyph that supports the decision whether existing solutions for uncertainty-aware PCA are sufficient, or whether a more expensive sampling-based approach is required. We apply our approach to several test data sets."

It will show why the greatest returns on AI investment come not from the models themselves, but from the maturity of the underlying software delivery system. We will explore a real-world transformation, using the journey of Unico IDTech https://unico.io as a prime example. This story demonstrates how creating a robust and consistent engineering structure Dev Prime coupled with a radical shift to user-centric monitoring SLOs and reliability engineering created the necessary high-quality Platform foundation. When this foundation is present-characterized by clear governance, healthy data ecosystems, and foundational practices-AI's benefits such as throughput and organizational performance gains are dramatically amplified.

    "abstract": "There is a growing concern about the limited integration of laboratory animal models in academic training programs in biomedicine and biotechnology, particularly in countries like Colombia. Understanding how animal models are used in research training is essential to ensure scientific advancement while upholding ethical standards and promoting animal welfare. This study employed the PRISMA methodology to conduct a rigorous and reproducible literature review on the use of rats and mice in research-oriented educational processes. A total of 105 scientific articles from 36 countries were identified, primarily published between 2022 and 2025, with the United States and Europe contributing the most. The literature revealed five thematic trends: the application of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement); the importance of robust experimental design; bioethical oversight through institutional committees; practices for ensuring laboratory animal welfare; and the role of educational training. Findings also show that animal models are indispensable in biomedical fields such as physiology, immunology, pharmacology, and behavioral science. However, their integration into academic curricula, especially in South America, remains uneven, with Brazil leading regional contributions and Colombia lagging. Less than 10% of studies proposed alternative models such as artificial intelligence, which remains a topic of ongoing debate. The review highlights significant disparities in educational curricula, both geographically and across disciplines. It concludes that while virtual tools offer complementary support, hands-on experience with animal models remains essential in health sciences education. There is a pressing need for curriculum reform and policy development to standardize the ethical and effective use of laboratory animals in academic settings. Ensuring alignment with international standards and preparing competent professionals with ethical awareness, experimental design knowledge, and practical skills will strengthen future research, improve public health responses, and address emerging biomedical challenges responsibly and sustainably."

To support the study, various learning theories were employed, such as Bandura's social learning theory and self-efficacy, Piaget's experiential learning, and the theory of mind proposed by Cohen, Leslie, and Frith. These provided a robust, multidimensional theoretical framework guiding method selection, addressing both processes of observation and imitation and the importance of self-efficacy and emotional interpretation in inclusive educational contexts. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, integrating qualitative and quantitative techniques to obtain a comprehensive, detailed view of the phenomenon. Data collection included semistructured interviews with two teachers specialized in basic education. Additionally, surveys were applied to 34 adolescents aged 14 and 15, of whom 3 have ASD. The study's results revealed that negative peer attitudes—shaped by lack of knowledge, stereotypes, scarcity of resources, and limited personalized support—constitute the most significant risk factors for school discrimination. It is concluded that immediate intervention strategies must be implemented through collaborative methodologies and teacher training programs to foster an inclusive and respectful school environment."

However, the large size of rPPG-based video data presents significant challenges in storage and bandwidth, especially when using standard compression algorithms like H.264, which often degrade the fidelity of physiological signals and visual quality. This paper introduces a saliency-guided preprocessing approach that strategically applies Gaussian blur to non-essential video regions while preserving critical areas for heart rate estimation. The proposed method enhances the effectiveness of H. 264 compression, achieving an average file size reduction of $24.9 \\%$ compared to unpreprocessed videos while maintaining high video quality, as evidenced by minimal differences in PSNR and SSIM values. Notably, the method preserved heart rate estimation accuracy based on rPPG signals, achieving an average accuracy of $96.48 \\%$, closely matching the performance of uncompressed videos $(96.56 \\%)$. These findings demonstrate the proposed method’s ability to balance compression efficiency with the preservation of critical physiological data and video quality, offering a practical and promising solution for efficient video storage and transmission in medical applications."

Problem-Based Learning (PBL) has emerged as an effective pedagogy for fostering critical thinking, creativity, and interdisciplinary collaboration. With the rise of Industry 4.0 technologies, including automation, data analytics, and IoT. There is growing interest in enhancing PBL by integrating these digital tools. However, the impact of such integration on learner engagement and preparedness remains underexplored. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from studies published between 2020 and 2025, drawn from academic databases including IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, Crossref, and Scopus. It examines how the incorporation of Industry 4.0 technologies into PBL frameworks affects engineering students' engagement, motivation, and technological problem-solving abilities. The central research question is: How does integrating Industry 4.0 tools into PBL curricula influence student engagement and preparedness compared to traditional PBL models? Findings indicate that embedding Industry 4.0 tools in PBL significantly boosts student engagement by enhancing the authenticity, interactivity, and industrial relevance of learning experiences. Students exposed to these technologies demonstrate improved confidence, advanced problem-solving skills, and greater readiness for contemporary engineering challenges. The review also identifies best practices, common barriers, and contextual factors affecting implementation. This study points out the transformative value of technologyaugmented PBL in engineering education. It calls for the development of adaptive, digitally enriched PBL models to equip future engineers with the competencies needed to drive innovation and address complex global problems. We discuss the implications for educators and policymakers."

    "abstract": "This report chronicles an education leadership conference to promote precollege quantum information science and technology (QIST) education in U.S. high schools during the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology in 2025. The goal of the conference was to inform K-12 school leaders about quantum ideas, the research landscape in the field, QIST curricular development, and the need for QIST education and workforce preparation strategies to meet the needs of emerging quantum industries. The conference was attended by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N=154$</tex> school district leaders, educational partners, and Stony Brook University faculty, researchers, and leadership. A sample of school district participants (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N=45$</tex>) reported strong interest in implementing QIST learning opportunities for their students but also reported a lack of resources to do this on their own. They valued higher education QIST expertise in providing professional development for teachers and informal outreach experiences for secondary students. Qualitative data from interviewed participants provided insights on short-term school district challenges in implementing QIST instruction, suggesting that research universities should take a more prominent role in designing and providing QIST outreach activities for precollege students and teachers."

    "abstract": "Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) has emerged as a promising approach for leveraging quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate classical parameterefficient fine-tuning (PEFT) parameters, enabling quantum enhanced fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). However, the practical implementation of QPA is hindered by the need for an extremely large number of quantum measurement shots, posing a significant challenge in realworld quantum computing environments. To address this issue, this work introduces Generative Interpolation (GI), a method inspired by frame generation in video data, where missing measurement probabilities are interpolated using a neural network-based generative model. By treating quantum measurement probabilities as analogous to video frames, GI estimates unmeasured basis state probabilities, significantly reducing the required quantum measurements. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating GI into QPA reduces the quantum measurement shot requirement to just 2.5 % of the original count while achieving superior fine-tuning performance. This method not only enhances QPA efficiency but also establishes a broader connection between classical deep learning techniques and quantum measurement reconstruction. The proposed generative framework has the potential to extend to variational quantum algorithms, offering a pathway toward reducing quantum measurement overhead in hybrid quantum-classical computing paradigms."

The study includes a comparative analysis of various hardware architectures with the example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, a central class of combinatorial optimization. It highlights what steps are necessary to run real-world applications on quantum hardware, showcases how the providers and various technologies differ and presents results in the relative efficiency of exemplary quantum algorithms on neutral atom-based, ion trap and superconducting hardware, the latter including both gate-based and annealing devices.

Classical benchmark problems, including cavity flow, Kovasznay flow, and the Taylor-Green vortex, were used as test cases. The results confirm that integrating LBM terms into the PINN loss function improves prediction accuracy and training stability compared to conventional PINNs.

This study proposes a machine learning framework for predicting potability of water using its physicochemical properties, allowing rapid and scalable assessment of water quality attributes. Pre-processing of the Kaggle water potability dataset, made up of 3,276 samples with 9 inputs, was done through mean imputation and Min–Max normalization as a strategy to address missing values and standardized features. The five supervised models, consisting of Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB), were explored and evaluated. The experimental results showed that GB was the finest, attaining an accuracy of 86%, significantly more than other models, and better than previously claimed. This machine learning framework set forth will be beneficial for automated and data-driven water quality monitoring. However, the practical challenges of an imbalanced dataset and not using any microbiological characteristics were recognized and would be planned for in future work by conducting further experimentation on expanded dataset sample sizes and evolving to hybrid models with complex features."

Although effective in theory, their practical impact on system-level performance, energy consumption, and memory subsystem behavior is complex and interdependent. This paper presents a performance/energy trade-off analysis of the aforementioned techniques through an empirical case study. We benchmark a diverse suite of six models, including a direct comparison of DistilBERT (conventional) and ALBERT (parameter-sharing) on a multi-GPU NVIDIA A100 platform. Our analysis across FP32, TF32, and mixed BF16 precisions reveals two key findings. First, contrary to its smaller parameter count, ALBERT is empirically up to 2.2× slower and triggers up to ~ 3× higher GPU memory footprint than DistilBERT; an effect that we attribute to its deep conceptual unrolling that led to many memory activations and thereby incurs an important overhead. Second, while mixed BF16 precision provides an average training speed-up of ~ 2.1×, the benefits are strongly model-dependent. Using an empirical Throughput-per-Watt (Samples/Joule) efficiency metric, we show that compute-bound models like TinyLlama are more energy efficient, whereas CNNs show marginal improvements, which we link to implicit TF32 acceleration in their FP32 baseline via the cuDNN library."

In this work, we introduce SHARP, a rule-based static analysis framework designed for OpenQASM that decouples hardware-specific constraints from the validation engine. By employing a rule-based approach, SHARP allows quantum computing services to validate programs against evolving instruction set architectures (ISAs) without having to modify the core analysis engine. SHARP achieves this by ingesting ISA descriptions as standalone data, making the validation engine resilient to hardware updates. Furthermore, the framework employs an analysis-driven validation mechanism that enables multi-stage validation, simplifying rule construction and enhancing extensibility. We demonstrate how SHARP supports hardware-specific validation tasks and discuss its impact on quantum software development, including language decoupling, program-level constraint validation, and feature access control. Our findings suggest that SHARP provides a path toward a scalable and maintainable programming interface for quantum computing."

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged to address these challenges, with lattice-based cryptography (LBC) being a prominent candidate. LBC, underpinned by hard mathematical problems like Learning with Errors (LWE) and Ring-LWE (RLWE), offers robust security against quantum and classical adversaries. In parallel, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CPABE) has become a critical tool for enabling fine-grained access control in data-sharing scenarios, such as secure cloud storage and IoT. While existing CP-ABE implementations rely on bilinear pairings vulnerable to quantum attacks, lattice-based CPABE schemes provide a quantum-resistant alternative. Despite their potential, these schemes face challenges in computational efficiency, collusion resistance, and implementation correctness. Our contributions include a detailed mathematical breakdown of one of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) lattice-based CP-ABE schemes and a novel correctness proof for the same scheme."

The airline companies are forced to invest in new technology, training of pilots, general maintenance, and observing safety standards. On the one hand, they also strongly need to reduce expenses and stay profitable in a rapidly growing market. This discussion examines how airline companies play the balancing game between safety rules and economic requirements. It examines the difference in attitudes towards safety in full-service and budget airlines, and how the attitude towards finances influences safety procedures. The review also discussed recent cases when the cost-cutting measures could have led to safety shortcomings. The results indicate that all airlines to which one can travel obey the rules, but some can be compromised when they run out of money. Another ethical issue in the essay is whether saving money is always more important than saving lives. These developments are not running as subtly, and as we become increasingly aware of the same, our analysis has served to indicate that there is a necessity to have more innovative policies and long-term investments that keep adding value to the economy and safety."

Consequently, many devices with vulnerabilities are being introduced into these contexts. Within this ecosystem, the MQTT communication protocol stands out, with the broker playing a crucial role in managing communication and data exchange between connected devices. A broker acts as an intermediary between devices that publish and consume data, making it an ideal target for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the behavior of some of the most widely used MQTT brokers in scenarios involving denial-of-service attacks. Three MQTT brokers were analyzed: EMQX, Mosquitto, and VerneMQ. The evaluation was conducted using specific metrics such as response time, CPU usage, and RAM usage. The brokers were subjected to DoS attacks, including Flooding CONNECT, PayloadBased Flooding, and QoS-Based Flooding. The results indicated that the Mosquitto broker presented the best average CPU and memory performance and better response time metrics for Payload-Based Flooding and QoS-Based Flooding attacks in most requests. Conversely, EMQX exhibited better performance in response time metrics during the Flooding CONNECT attack."

This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trappedion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trappedion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information.

    "abstract": "Microservices have transformed software architecture through the creation of modular and independent services. However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Prior works on fault localisation within microservice architectures have seen the use of causal inference to infer dependencies between microservices during a fault. However, they scale poorly to real world deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. Furthermore, such approaches often rely on the onset of a fault being known, or on anomaly detection approaches that do not consider the dependencies between microservices. In this paper we explore the use of functional connectivity to efficiently infer statistical relationships between microservice metrics at runtime and to detect changes within microservice deployments. We demonstrate that such structural changes can be indicative of faults which in turn can be used to locate candidates for root cause analysis without incurring the significant overheads of causal inference approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localisation performance."

    "abstract": "Runoff prediction is critical for urban flood control, water resource optimization, and disaster risk management. To improve prediction accuracy, this study proposes a daily runoff prediction method integrating improved adaptive noise-complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (ICEEMDAN), permutation entropy (PE) screening, and wavelet hard threshold denoising. First, ICEEMDAN decomposes the original runoff series into multiple intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, effectively addressing modal aliasing in traditional decomposition methods and achieving precise multi-scale decomposition. Next, permutation entropy quantifies each component's complexity, enabling wavelet hard threshold denoising of noise-dominated components to suppress high-frequency noise while preserving key hydrological features. The processed data then feeds into an ICEEMDAN-CNN-LSTM hybrid model, which uses IMF components and residual data from the previous year as input. This architecture combines CNN's spatial feature extraction with LSTM's long-term temporal dependency capture, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy for non-stationary runoff series. Experimental results from Lanzhou and Malong stations show the model's superior performance over traditional LSTM and CNN-LSTM models, achieving Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (NSE) of 0.9809 and 0.9856, respectively, with significant reductions in MAPE, RMSE, and MAE. This study demonstrates that the proposed model not only enhances prediction accuracy but also shows excellent cross-site applicability, offering reliable technical support for flood control and water resource management in complex basins."

    "abstract": "Quantum computers are susceptible to noise or errors, and it is critical to quantify the impact of noise acting on a quantum circuit. The density matrix-based fidelity, referred to as DM Fidelity, aka Uhlmann fidelity, provides a measure that quantifies the closeness between a noise-free density matrix and its noisy density matrix. However, DM Fidelity is computationally expensive, since density matrices require full-state tomography, and also necessitates noise-free results. Consequently, different metrics have been proposed to estimate the noise impact of a quantum circuit. In this paper, we study the commonly used metrics, including Hellinger Fidelity, Total Variational Distance (TVD), Estimated Success Probability (ESP), Probability of Successful Trials (PST), Clifford-based Fidelity Estimation, purity measure using either CSWAP or Classical Shadows, and Shadow Overlap, and show how well these metrics correlate to DM Fidelity. We also identify certain regions and conditions where one metric correlates with DM Fidelity better than others. The metrics are computed with a noise simulator using noise models derived from IBMQ quantum computers on the SupermarQ benchmarks. Among the aforementioned metrics, our results show that ESP and PST have the highest correlation with DM Fidelity: ESP has a Spearman correlation of 0.88, signifying a positive nonlinear correlation, while PST has a Pearson correlation of 0.92, signifying a positive linear correlation. Accurate fidelity estimation has many applications. In our paper, we present an application in quantum error mitigation. We show that using fidelity metrics that correlate well with DM Fidelity is more effective than using other metrics. In particular, our results on real IBM Quantum hardware show that Reliability Based Zero Noise Extrapolation (RZNE), using ESP/PST achieves a fidelity (Hellinger) improvement of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7.44 x / 7.83 x$</tex> over the baseline without error-mitigation. Using other metrics like Clifford fidelity which has a Spearman Correlation of 0.73 to DM Fidelity, would be less effective: RZNE with Clifford fidelity shows a fidelity improvement gain of 4.31x."

    "abstract": "The success of quantum circuits in providing reliable outcomes for a given problem depends on the gate count and depth in near-term noisy quantum computers. A circuit (that implements a given function) with a low gate count and short depth is more likely to give a correct solution than the circuit variant with a higher gate count and depth. As such, quantum circuit compilers that decompose high-level gates to native gates of the hardware and optimize the circuit play a key role in quantum computing. However, the quality and time complexity of the optimization process can vary significantly especially for practically relevant large-scale quantum circuits. As a result, third-party (often less-trusted/untrusted/unreliable) compilers have emerged, claiming to provide better and faster optimization of complex quantum circuits than so-called trusted compilers. However, untrusted compilers, with their varying adversarial motives ranging from semi-honest to malicious can pose severe security risks such as counterfeiting the sensitive intellectual property (IP) embedded within the quantum circuit. We propose an obfuscation technique for quantum circuits using randomized reversible gates to protect them from such attacks during compilation. The idea is to insert a small random circuit into the original circuit and send it to the untrusted compiler. Since the circuit function is corrupted, the adversary (i.e., an untrusted compiler) may get incorrect IP. However, the user may also get incorrect output post-compilation (even though highly optimized). To circumvent this issue, we concatenate the inverse of the random circuit in the compiled circuit to recover the original functionality. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by conducting exhaustive experiments on a set of benchmark circuits and measuring the quality of obfuscation by calculating the Total Variation Distance (TVD) and Degree of Functional Corruption (DFC) metrics. Our method achieves TVD of up to 1.92, indicating substantial functional corruption, and performs at least <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 x$</tex> better than a previously reported obfuscation method. We also attained a DFC as low as −0.75, approaching the −1 score that represents maximal functional corruption, further ensuring the robustness of our proposed method against counterfeiting. We also propose a novel adversarial reverse engineering (RE) approach and show that the proposed obfuscation is resilient against RE attacks. The proposed technique introduces minimal degradation in fidelity (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 1 \\%$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 3 \\%$</tex> on average)."

Still, traditional deep literacy models, including Convolutional Neural Networks( CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks( DNNs), face critical challenges related to data Privacy, computational costs, and Representation Learning across different datasets. To address these issues, this study introduces Federated Contrastive Pretraining(FCP), a new approach that integrates Federated Learning(FL) with Contrastive Learning to enhance Privacy- conserving medical AI. FCP enables AI models to be trained across multiple hospitals without participating in raw case data, icing compliance with GDPR and HIPAA regulations. Using SimCLR and MoCo-grounded Contrastive Learning, FCP reduces Hospital-specific impulses and improves model Representation Learning. Experimental results demonstrate that FCP significantly enhances individual delicacy( from 85 to 95% and 95 to 98%) while reducing computational costs and icing strong Privacy protection. Likewise, Explainable AI(XAI) ways, similar to Grad-CAM, give interpretability, allowing medical professionals to validate AI predictions effectively. The proposed approach presents a scalable and Privacy-conserving result for AI-driven medical diagnostics, particularly in brain excrescence and Alzheimer’s disease discovery."

    "abstract": "In motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, a major challenge in classifying EEG signals independently of individuals is the significant inter-subject variability, which causes models trained for one person to perform poorly for others. These differences stem from physiological and structural characteristics of the brain, as well as behavioral and cognitive factors such as concentration and fatigue. This study aims to design a model capable of effectively classifying EEG signals from new subjects without requiring retraining. To achieve this, the model utilizes data from multiple subjects (source domain) to classify EEG signals for new subjects (target domain) by identifying and transferring shared features across individuals. To address this challenge, a comprehensive framework is proposed that maps data from both domains to a common space. This mapping is achieved through domain-specific transformations that align the domains in a latent space. To enhance the transfer process, an algorithm for selecting and weighting key samples is introduced, utilizing graphs and geometric relationships between samples. This method amplifies the influence of important samples while reducing the effect of less significant ones. The proposed algorithm first extracts features using the RCSP method and maps the data to the shared space. Finally, the model is trained using a support vector machine (SVM) and achieves an accuracy of $84.43 \\%$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach."

    "abstract": "Distributed quantum networks require robust protocols for high-capacity, noise-resilient communication between spatially separated nodes. Superdense coding, which leverages shared entanglement to transmit two classical bits per qubit, is a key primitive for benchmarking such networks. However, entanglement degradation from channel noise and decoherence poses major challenges for achieving scalable throughput in practical environments. We introduce a testbed protocol for adaptive superdense coding in distributed quantum networks (DQNs), integrating the five-qubit error correction code with a global, feedback-driven purification routine. By continuously monitoring quantum discord (QD) and entanglement of formation (EoF) via dedicated pilot pairs, our protocol dynamically tunes purification parameters to counteract amplitude and phase damping, while avoiding the loss of entangled pairs inherent to traditional schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that this hybrid quantum-classical approach enhances channel fidelity and throughput under realistic noise, providing a scalable testbed for distributed quantum error correction strategies and hybrid control in next-generation quantum networks."

To enhance the atom-light interaction and increase the fidelity of state preparation, we will utilize a high optical depth (OD) ensemble along with shot noise-limited polarimetry. We are currently working on increasing the OD by increasing the optical power for laser cooling and trapping by introducing a tapered amplifier into the setup. We expect that this platform will enable efficient generation of spin squeezing in a large atomic ensemble."

Our DGGN consists of two modules: the GPSone module is responsible for analyzing the discourse dependency structure between dialogues, and the GPStwo module is responsible for analyzing the dependency structure between speakers, and then fusing the two information through the interaction module. The experimental results on MELD, DailyDialog, and EmoryNLP datasets show that DGGN outperforms the existing best baseline in terms of performance. In addition, this method greatly reduces the training time, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the model."

    "abstract": "High-speed train fault diagnosis systems face significant challenges in achieving both rapid response and reliable detection under computational and communication constraints. While cloud computing offers substantial computational resources, the limited communication bandwidth and potential instability of train-to-ground networks make it impractical to continuously transmit all sensor data to remote servers. Conversely, edge computing alone is restricted by the computational resources available on-board. This paper proposes an efficient fault diagnosis method based on cloudedge collaboration leveraging dynamic neural inference. The proposed approach features a dynamic inference mechanism that intelligently allocates computational tasks between edge and cloud resources based on sample complexity, along with TernP Networks, a lightweight architecture specifically designed for multi-channel sensor signals through positional normalization, partial convolution, and point-wise convolution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves improved accuracy and reduced latency while significantly reducing data transmission requirements, with the majority of cases being successfully processed at the edge. The dynamic framework demonstrates significant potential for realworld deployment in high-speed rail systems where reliable, real-time fault diagnosis is essential for operational safety."

    "abstract": "An optimized workflow is presented for two common failure types occurring in Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with failures in the Memory Built-in SelfTest (MBIST). The first involves failures in single bits, adjacent bits, or clusters of bits. These defects usually originate at the physical locations of the failed bit-cells and can be effectively analyzed through bitmap diagnosis and standard Electrical Failure Analysis (EFA) techniques, such as Photon Emission Microscopy (PEM) and Dynamic Analysis by Laser Stimulation (DALS). The second category includes failures affecting one or more bit lines or word lines, often implicating multiple suspected blocks in the upstream or downstream circuitry of the bit-cell array. In such cases, PEM and DALS may not provide sufficient resolution to accurately identify the failure location or mode (e.g., stuck-at, slow edge, or delay faults), potentially resulting in inconclusive Physical Failure Analysis (PFA) outcomes. Because of the difficulty in localizing this second type, an additional technique of Electro-Optical Probing (EOP) can be employed for further isolation. This study demonstrated that a customized test pattern may be necessary in EOP due to the limited test-loop length which occurs in test patterns converted from Automated Test Equipment (ATE) systems."

Therefore, to ensure the dependability and ongoing operation of HoT electronics devices, it is essential to identify anomaly data properly. Similar studies that have previously been conducted either employ semisupervised strategies to improve detection performance by leveraging the minimal amount of labelled data or unsupervised ways to learn from unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose an organizational structure to identify such attacks to address these problems. A stacked autoencoder (SAE) system was used to create false occurrences of minority class data. To improve the model's generalizability and handle a variety of attack scenarios, the constructed classes correct for data imbalances. When several machine learning (ML) techniques were examined, the Random Forest (RF) model continuously produced better results, with an accuracy of 100%. Particularly vulnerable to dimensionality improvements were conventional techniques like Logistic Regression (LR), which saw an F1-score decline of 60% when its primary features were same. This study demonstrates the significance of comprehending two datasets, data features, and algorithmic performance, and how they may affect ML effectiveness. By emphasizing the vital necessity of thorough ML model hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, especially for models susceptible to dimensionality reduction, this investigation will improve cybersecurity in IIoTs."

An extensive data of tea leaf images was assembled that includes both disease and healthy samples of some common tea plant diseases including blister blight, gray blight, red rust and algal leaf spot. The EfficientNet-B5 is a model which relies on transfer learning to achieve better result through fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Bone tumors are abnormal cell growths within bone tissue and may be benign or malignant, with the latter capable of rapid progression and metastasis. Early and accurate detection significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on radiographic imaging such as X-rays and MRI, which are manually interpreted by radiologists—a process that can be time-consuming and prone to error. This study presents a fully automated bone tumor detection system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which learn complex visual patterns directly from medical images without manual feature engineering. The proposed model preprocesses X-ray images, extracts relevant features, and classifies them as tumor or non-tumor. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-based system achieves high diagnostic accuracy, significantly reduces interpretation time, and enhances early detection capabilities. These outcomes underscore the model’s potential as a robust clinical decision support tool, contributing to faster diagnosis, more precise treatment planning, and improved patient care."

    "abstract": "The development of detailed fascial tissue models is an essential aspect in research of medical suture failure. These models can be created on the basis of tensile test data and require accurate deformation measurement. Typically, this is done by applying colored dots or a speckle pattern to simplify the tracking with digital image correlation (DIC). This method leads to time-consuming preparation of the test objects and a computationally intensive analysis. This paper presents an alternative approach to automated strain analysis, using opensource tracking algorithms to measure the deformation of natural textures on fascial tissue. As part of the evaluation, a straindependent error in the displacement of individual tracking points was identified using artificial videos of idealized stretched fascial textures. By automating and simplifying the deformation measurement, the described approach enables researchers to easily investigate various different fascial tissue samples in order to generate more characteristic data and improve existing models."

Therefore, the detection of AI comments has become important. Traditional AI text detection methods are mainly applied to long texts like academic writings. To make up for this deficiency, our study focuses on comments, which are relatively short texts. We propose two BERT-based models with Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy neural network (TSK FNN) to detect AI-generated comments on social media platforms. The first model is just a TSK FNN (BERT-TSK for short), which uses BERT features extracted from the hidden layers and the sentiment value of each comment (obtained by the sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face) as inputs, and the second is a BERT-TSK hybrid model (BERT-TSK-H for short), which embeds TSK FNN into BERT hidden layers for jointly training. The study compares the performance of our proposed two models with the fine-tuned BERT model on Chinese and English comment datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model BERT-TSK-H outperforms BERT-TSK and the fine-tuned BERT model in terms of most of the metrics, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score on the two datasets."

    "abstract": "This study aims to solve the problem of the multilingual sentiment perception and content generation in cross-border e-commerce and proposes a new cross-lingual generation framework TASG (Translation-Aware Sentiment Generation) that integrates language perception and sentiment control. The model consists of four core modules: multilingual sentiment alignment embedding module (MSAE), cross-lingual consistency loss function, sentiment control generation module, and adversarial optimization mechanism. The MSAE module aligns the sentiment semantic features of the source language and the target language through a joint embedding mechanism. This operation can ensure cross-lingual sentiment consistency. The sentiment control module adopts a dynamic gating mechanism to achieve hierarchical injection in the decoding stage. This operation enhances the continuity and context adaptability of sentiment expression. The adversarial mechanism introduces a language discriminator to obtain a language-independent but sentiment-preserving shared representation through game training. This module can improve cross-lingual generalization ability of the model. The effectiveness has not been verified. The model is tested on three datasets: Amazon multilingual reviews, WMT sentiment corpus, and EComm-CNJP e-commerce product descriptions. The evaluation indicators are evaluated from five dimensions: sentiment recognition accuracy (SA), translation quality (BLEU), sentiment consistency (EAS), marketing adaptability (MFS), and zero-shot transfer capability (CGR). The experimental results show that the average emotion recognition accuracy of the TASG model in the English-German, English-French and Chinese-Japanese language pairs reaches 85.77%. In the multilingual emotion controllable generation task, the BLEU-4 score is improved by 11.4%, and the EAS score is improved by an average of 14.3%. This fully verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

This paper introduces a real-time, flexible, and lightweight network log analysis framework that uses unsupervised machine learning approaches to identify unusual activity, including zero-day. To extract important indicators, including flow duration, packet ratios, and time-based metrics, the suggested framework makes use of feature engineering and packet sniffing. Without the use of labelled datasets, an Isolation Forest model is trained to detect anomalies in this data. A React-based frontend dashboard is also integrated into the framework to visualize log traffic and threats in real time. Our technique provides an open-source, scalable, and user-friendly solution in contrast to current solutions that are either resource-intensive or lack intelligent detection capabilities. According to preliminary evaluations, the framework exhibits good accuracy and reactivity, making it appropriate for implementation in both business and educational settings. By integrating interactive analysis and intelligent anomaly detection in a real-time pipeline that respects privacy, our framework offers a workable substitute for signature-based detection methods."

To address these challenges, we propose CEDLog, a novel practical framework that integrates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for continual learning and implements distributed computing for scalable processing by integrating Apache Airflow and Dask. In CEDLog, anomalies are detected through the synthesis of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) using critical features present in event logs. Through comparisons with update strategies on large-scale datasets, we demonstrate the strengths of CEDLog, showcasing efficient updates and low false positives."

Under FL, only model parameters are transmitted to a central server in charge of building the global model. As a result, the privacy of the users is preserved. However, the practical deployment of FL poses a number of challenges. In particular, the large dimensions of FL models, along with the complex operations it employs, result in communication bottlenecks and high energy consumption. One way to reduce communication and energy costs is via user selection. In this context, we design a multi-criteria selection framework for user selection in a heterogeneous and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data environment. The proposed framework involves three selection criteria, including the achievable data rates of devices, their energy consumption, and their statistical data distribution. Our experimental results show that the multicriteria selection framework saves around $60 \\%$ of the consumed energy when compared to a selection based on data rate only, and $30 \\%$ when compared to a selection scheme that minimizes the energy only."

Efficient ND is required for efficient resource allocation (RA), which is one of the significant challenges of C-V2X communication. Efficient ND can be performed by efficient device discovery (DD) to classify the cellular and vehicle users in the C-V2X environment as optimal or non-optimal. Hence, only optimal users with strong signals, high throughput, and low interference can participate in the RA process, improving the system’s overall throughput and sum rate. We compare the average sum rate achieved by the NEAT algorithm and state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we perform a comparative assessment of the time complexity of NEAT in contrast to other state-of-the-art techniques employed for RA. These techniques confine the simple graph matching, brute force, and Hungarian algorithm. Our results show that NEAT achieves an average sum rate of $12.8 \\mathrm{bps} / \\mathrm{Hz}$, compared to $8.5 \\mathrm{bps} / \\mathrm{Hz}$ for random resource allocation (RRA), demonstrating a 50.6% improvement in throughput. Additionally, NEAT maintains an $O(N)$ time complexity, significantly outperforming brute force $O(N!)$ and the Hungarian algorithm $O\\left(N^{3}\\right)$, making it a scalable solution for large-scale V2X networks."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of short video platforms, the problem of user sentiment drift and cold start of new content has become a dual challenge that the recommendation system needs to solve urgently. In this work, we propose a short video recommendation system that integrates new measurable interpretations provided by a large language model (LLM). In specific, the proposed approach leverages the LLM for model enhancement and explanations generation on the basis of the existing “recall-sorting” recommendation framework. To this end, we make two contributions: (A) A multimodal-LLM recall module to address the cold-start recommendation problem of new videos. To overcome the absence of visual information available in the original KuaiRand dataset, we employ the cover image manually crawled from the Internet, extract the semantic vector of the image and text from the visual pre-training model CLIP to construct a Prompt or RAG input to LLM to rate the new video and achieve recommendation of the new content with zero user interaction. (B) To address the user sentiment drift challenge, we exploit the user feedback sequence provided by KuaiRand to map the 12dimensional behavioral feedback to an implicit emotional trajectory, and we incorporate the LLMRank Prompt module to sense the user's emotional trajectory during feedback, facilitating ranking of emotional sentiment of the candidate videos, while generating an explanation text. These two modules create an LLM interpretive recommendation system for content and emotion modeling, offering a new perspective to short video platforms toward the dual challenge of the cold start and sentiment drift issues across user behavior and associated content. The system outperformed existing approaches in terms of new video recall accuracy and user emotion-aware rearranging performance in experiments on the KuaiRand dataset."

    "abstract": "Inquiry-based learning (IBL) has been promoted in Japanese secondary education since 2021 to develop problemsolving skills. Uchino Junior High School (JHS) started IBL in 2023, but challenges arose in fostering student agency and supporting teachers in adopting a facilitative teaching role, attributed to a lack of “empathy” in the design thinking process as a key factor impeding the effective “definition” of inquiry issues. The program was revised in 2024, integrating an engineering approach and enhancing external collaborations to promote empathy and proactive student engagement. This study examines the effects of enhanced external collaboration and the integration of an engineering approach in the 2024 IBL program at the JHS. The analysis focuses on two core objectives: (1) fostering students' sense of agency to actively participate in IBL, and (2) empowering teachers to effectively facilitate the inquiry process. Additionally, the study explores the factors that influenced success or difficulties in meeting these objectives. The results of this study highlighted the effect of integrating an engineering approach and engaging experts early in the IBL process to enhance students' empathy and improve their ability to define inquiry topics. Additionally, early expert involvement stimulated inquiry activities and enabled teachers to act as colearners alongside students. On the other hand, the findings of this study also pointed out a limitation whereby students' selfgenerated questions were not sufficiently internalized as personal issues, resulting in inquiry outcomes that remained at the level of general information compilation. To address this challenge, the study further proposed key findings for the successful implementation of engineering approach-integrated IBL. The study also emphasizes adopting a systematic, engineering-based problem-solving approach to help traditionally trained teachers advance IBL practices."

This paper evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs for two tasks: generating firewall datasets with anomalies and detecting those anomalies. Although these models are built for general-purpose reasoning, they struggle with the structured logic required in firewall management. Future work should focus on adapting their reasoning capabilities to fit real-world firewall tasks."

    "abstract": "Under the nearing error-corrected era of quantum computing, it is necessary to understand the suitability of certain post-NISQ algorithms for practical problems. One of the most promising, applicable and yet difficult to implement in practical terms is the Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for linear systems of equations. An enormous number of problems can be expressed as linear systems of equations, from Machine Learning to fluid dynamics. However, in most cases, HHL will not be able to provide a practical, reasonable solution to these problems. This paper's goal inquires about whether problems can be labeled using Machine Learning classifiers as suitable or unsuitable for HHL implementation when some numerical information about the problem is known beforehand. This work demonstrates that training on significantly representative data distributions is critical to achieve good classifications of the problems based on the numerical properties of the matrix representing the system of equations. Accurate classification is possible through Multi-Layer Perceptrons, although with careful design of the training data distribution and classifier parameters."

    "abstract": "Temporal interactions form the crux of numerous real-world scenarios, thus necessitating effective modeling in temporal graph representation learning. Despite extensive research within this domain, we identify a significant oversight in current methodologies: the temporal-spatial dynamics in graphs, encompassing both structural and temporal coherence, remain largely unaddressed. In an effort to bridge this research gap, we present a novel framework termed Graph Representation learning enhanced by Periodic and Community Interactions (GRPCI). GRPCI consists of two primary mechanisms devised explicitly to tackle the aforementioned challenge. Firstly, to utilize latent temporal dynamics, we propose a novel periodicity-based neighborhood aggregation mechanism that underscores neighbors engaged in a periodic interaction pattern. This mechanism seamlessly integrates the element of periodicity into the model. Secondly, to exploit structural dynamics, we design a novel contrastive-based local community representation learning mechanism. This mechanism features a heuristic dynamic contrastive pair sampling strategy aimed at enhancing the modeling of the latent distribution of local com munities within the graphs. Through the incorporation of these two mechanisms, GRPCI markedly augments the performance of graph networks. Empirical evaluations, conducted via a temporal link prediction task across five real-life datasets, attest to the superior performance of GRPCI in comparison to existing state of-the-art methodologies. The results of this study validate the efficacy of GRPCI, thereby establishing a new benchmark for future research in the field of temporal graph representation learning. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both temporal and structural consistency in temporal graph learning, and advocate for further exploration of this paradigm."

    "abstract": "Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology can achieve charging for devices on the move, like automated guided vehicles, which can dramatically improve their working efficiency. In this paper, the generalized state-space averaging (GSSA) model of the DWPT system is established, where the state equations are derived in accordance with the equivalent circuit, and then all state variables are separated into sine and cosine items using the Fourier series. The established model reveals that the maximum efficiency points of the DWPT system are correlated with the phase differences between currents of two adjacent transmitting coils at different mutual inductance conditions. As a result, the system's efficiency can be optimized by adjusting the phase differences of transmitting currents. Finally, numerous simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the GSSA model. The results prove the high accuracy of the model, and the efficiency calculation errors are less than 0.21% and 2.38% when the phase differences are 0 and -89 degrees, respectively. The model exhibits only a one-degree error in tracking the maximum efficiency point when the receiver is located 5 cm away from the reference position. Additionally, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the efficiency optimization is achieved by tuning the Tx current's phase."

The analysis is carried out for Ka-band operation at 26.5 GHz, assuming a transmission-oriented link with single linear polarization under a narrowband array factor model. Various array geometries are evaluated, positioned on different surfaces with varying inter-element and inter-layer spacing. A design algorithm is proposed to optimize directivity, Side-Lobe Levels (SLL), and Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) while maintaining a fixed number of antenna elements. By strategically placing conformal arrays at the cube’s corners, rather than using a single-surface configuration, the communication window between LEO and GEO satellites is extended by up to 45.6%, while significantly reducing the SLL and enhancing the Field Of View (FOV). Additionally, the study examines the impact of inter-element and inter-layer spacing on beam sharpness and directivity. The methodology and findings are generalizable to smaller LEO satellite platforms, where element placement and conformal integration would be scaled accordingly. The findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to enhance ISL efficiency, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for future satellite constellations while enabling adaptive beamforming for dynamic space environments."

Specifically, with the aid of RIS, a transmitter Alice is to sense the potential existence of a target, and she is also probabilistically trying to send information to a receiver Bob covertly (i.e., trying to hide her transmissions from a warden Willie). Meanwhile, Willie is to detect whether Alice is sensing the target only or conducting ISACC. We consider two RIS operation modes, i.e., a non-adaptive mode, where RIS employs a common beamforming vector regardless of whether Alice performs sensing-only or ISACC transmissions, and an adaptive mode, where RIS dynamically switches between two beamforming vectors tailored to the transmission type. For each mode, we formulate and solve an optimization problem that jointly determines Alice’s power allocation fraction <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ρ</i> for covert information signals and RIS beamforming vectors to maximize the effective covert communication throughput, while satisfying sensing and covertness constraints. Our examination shows that in the non-adaptive mode, the optimal <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ρ</i> decreases with the blocklength <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>, the number of RIS elements <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>, or Alice’s transmit power <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>, reflecting a stronger trade-off between covert throughput and sensing reliability.

Numerical results further demonstrate a significant covert communication throughput gain of the adaptive mode over the non-adaptive mode, which increases with both <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>, highlighting the importance of RIS adaptivity in the ISACC systems."

    "abstract": "Device authentication protocols based on a strong physical unclonable function (PUF) show promise for enhancing Internet of Things security. However, a strong PUF is vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. This paper proposes a Feistel structure sequential obfuscation-based PUF (Feistel-PUF) to resist ML attacks. When the PUF is obfuscated by the Feistel structure, the challenge-response relationship resembles that of sequential logic circuits. Specifically, each response depends on both current and historical challenges, thereby significantly increasing the complexity of the challenge-response mapping. Experimental results showed that even with 1 million collected challenge response pairs, the prediction accuracies of ML attacks on Feistel-PUF remained at approximately 50%. Notably, the obfuscation process excluded response data, thereby preserving the randomness, reliability, and uniqueness of PUF with negligible performance degradation. The Feistel structure was iteratively reused for sequential obfuscation processing, maintaining constant and minimal hardware overhead. We propose a novel approach that combines the Feistel-PUF with an authentication protocol. This system synchronizes obfuscation parameters during the initial registration phase and implements dynamic updates throughout the authentication process. This approach allows the obfuscation structure to be made public, thereby overcoming the reliance on structure or algorithm secrecy in traditional dynamic challenge obfuscation schemes. The security of the protocol was confirmed by subjecting it to ProVerif verification and security analysis."

    "abstract": "An important question in data-driven control is how to obtain an informative dataset. In this work, we consider the problem of effective data acquisition of an unknown linear system with bounded disturbance for both open-loop and closed-loop stages. The learning objective is to minimize the volume of the set of admissible systems. First, a performance measure based on historical data and the input sequence is introduced to characterize the upper bound of the volume of the set of admissible systems. On the basis of this performance measure, an open-loop active learning strategy is proposed to minimize the volume by actively designing inputs during the open-loop stage. For the closed-loop stage, a closed-loop active learning strategy is designed to select and learn from informative closed-loop data. The efficiency of the proposed closed-loop active learning strategy is proved by showing that the unselected data cannot benefit the learning performance. Furthermore, an adaptive predictive controller is designed in accordance with the proposed data acquisition approach. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the controller are proved by analyzing the effect of the closed-loop active learning strategy. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed data acquisition strategy."

Robust secret image sharing (RSIS) schemes have been proposed to address this issue, yet existing methods often suffer significant degradation in reconstruction quality as the attack strength increases, revealing limitations in their robustness. To address these issues, we propose an RSIS scheme against malicious shadow images by Reusing Polynomial Coefficients with hash function (RSIS-RPC), which provides both malicious shadow detection and error correction capabilities. The correction capability improves with the degree of coefficient reuse, where greater reuse provides stronger resilience to pixel corruption. However, as more coefficients are reused, the size of the generated shadow images increases correspondingly, resulting in higher storage requirements. This trade-off between robustness and efficiency makes the proposed scheme adaptable to diverse application scenarios requiring secure and resilient image sharing. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior robustness compared to existing schemes."

An angle estimation method of the RCJ system based on the joint-transmit-and-receive-beam synthesis and complex-monopulse-ratio vector (JTRBS-CMRV) is proposed. First, the effect of the two-element RCJ system on the monopulse phased array-radar (MPAR) is analyzed, the result indicates that the consistent phase responses of the transmit-and-receive-beam on the two jamming paths induce a large angle estimation error in MPAR. Second, based on the flexibility of forming transmit and receive beams with various weights in digital array radar, a joint transmit-and-receive-beam weight synthesis problem is formulated to counteract the phase shift caused by RCJ, such that the jamming signals are effectively accumulated in the sum beam and cancelled out in the difference beam, and the angle estimation error is mitigated. The transmit-and-receive-beam weights of JTRBS CMRV are solved via the interior-point method. Finally, utiliz ing the sparsity characteristic of the RCJ parameters, the RCJ angle is estimated using the CMRV obtained from simultaneously formed monopulse beams steering at different directions. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of JTRBS CMRV. JTRBS-CMRV effectively mitigates the monopulse angle measurement error induced by RCJ via joint-transmit-and-receive beamsynthesis, and estimates the RCJ angle precisely under various geometric relationships between DAR and RCJ."

However, severe transmission attenuation and dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) requirements often lead to energy imbalance and waste issues in WPUSNs. To address the challenges, we introduce a recycling mechanism that enables nodes to harvest energy from each other, thereby proposing the recycling WPUSN. Under this framework, the time allocation strategy is key to balancing energy harvesting and transmission performance. We take time slot as the optimization variable and formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem under heterogeneous QoS constraints. To solve this nonconcave fractional programming problem, we develop a Quadratic Transform-based Projected (QTP) Algorithm, which iteratively applies Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and projection operations to approximate the optimal solution. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves energy efficiency performance by 17.454% and converges 70 times faster compared with the commercial optimization solvers. The proposed recycling WPUSN opens up new prospects for sustainable underground environmental monitoring."

In particular, this work focus on systems that support text-based interaction where the system detects the user's emotion and responds accordingly. We have scouted over 6000 articles for this review, selecting 74 of them and reviewing them to identify datasets, methods, evaluation techniques, and challenges in the area. Our analysis points out an overwhelming bias toward researching these problems in English and Chinese, with few to no resources for other languages. Although several methodologies are proposed in the literature, including Seq2Seq and Conditional Variational Autoencoders, more recent research has been focused on the Transformer architecture. It is recognized that there are manual metrics that do not have an equivalent to automatic metrics, and there are variations in human evaluation results in comparison to modern automated metrics. With this paper, we aim to summarize the state-of-the-art of deep learning techniques for emotional response generation while identifying open research questions."

    "abstract": "This work considers a non-terrestrial network where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate with a base station (BS) via a high-altitude platform (HAP)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In such configurations, the existence of obstacles blocking the direct link (DiL) between the UAV and BS depends on the positions of the HAP and UAV, which can vary over time. Therefore, the existence of the DiL is random. If the DiL exists, the large structures in urban areas may reflect the transmitted signals, forming a strong DiL. Due to the difference in distances, UAV-HAP-BS and UAV-BS, the signals from the two links may arrive at the receiver with different time delays, introducing intersymbol interference (ISI). Therefore, this work evaluates the impact of ISI on RIS-assisted UAV communications, where an analytical framework is developed to characterize the effects of ISI on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and outage probability. Monte Carlo simulation results validate the analytical results, revealing that a strong DiL can reduce the performance gains provided by RISs, especially with a limited number of reflectors. Consequently, integrating ISI mitigation techniques with RIS deployment is crucial to avoid performance degradation."

In this design, the UAV’s long-term transmit power is minimized by jointly adjusting the transmission rate and power across XP-HARQ transmissions. To solve the optimization problem under stringent URLLC constraints, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The performance metrics, including average transmit power, achievable throughput, and energy efficiency, are analytically characterized over time-varying UAV-to-UAV channels. Simulation results corroborate the superiority of the proposed system using XP-HARQ over conventional ARQ/HARQ schemes in FSO systems and quantify the transmit power required under different URLLC demands. Finally, we investigate the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI) on system performance, highlighting practical design considerations."

    "abstract": "To mitigate the barren plateau problem, effective parameter initialization is crucial for optimizing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in the near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Prior physicsdriven approaches leveraged the optimal parameter concentration phenomenon, utilizing medium values of previously optimized QAOA parameters stored in databases as initialization for new graphs. However, this medium-value-based strategy lacks generalization capability. Conversely, prior computer-sciencebased approaches employed graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on previously optimized QAOA parameters to predict initialization values for new graphs. However, these approaches neglect key physics-informed QAOA principles, such as parameter concentration, symmetry, and adiabatic evolution, resulting in suboptimal parameter predictions and limited performance improvements. Furthermore, no existing GNN-based methods support parameter initialization for QAOA circuits with variable depths or for solving weighted Max-Cut problems. This paper introduces QSeer, a quantum-inspired GNN designed for accurate QAOA parameter prediction. First, we propose a quantum-inspired input data normalization technique to ensure a consistent input scale and mitigate the influence of varying feature magnitudes. By integrating key physics-informed QAOA principles, such as parameter concentration, symmetry, and adiabatic evolution, this approach enhances QSeer's training stability and convergence. Second, we encode Max-Cut edge weights as edge attributes in QSeer's GNN framework, enabling parameter prediction for QAOA circuits solving both unweighted and weighted Max-Cut problems. Third, we incorporate the circuit depth <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$p$</tex> as an input, allowing QSeer to generalize parameter predictions across different QAOA depths.

While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of Noè et al. [1], who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set [2], thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our using parallel annealing grants it a speed-up of almost 70% compared to regular annealing-based BM execution."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has made significant advancements in the last years in both hardware and software. Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise. Many optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects thereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling quantum applications from currently considered small research examples to industrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum circuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic qubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits already for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that reduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is essential. This raises the question, whether we need to start from scratch, or whether current state-of-the-art optimization techniques can be used as a basis for this. To approach this question, this work investigates the effects of different optimization passes on a representative selection of quantum circuits. Since hardly any tools to automatically design and evaluate FTQC quantum circuits exist yet, we utilize resource estimation to compare the (potential) benefits gained by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization to estimated FTQC resource requirements. The Results indicate that, indeed, the estimated resource requirements for FTQC can be improved by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization techniques. At the same time, more detailed investigations show what techniques lead to more benefits for FTQC compared to others, providing guidelines for the transfer of NISQ optimization techniques to the FTQC era."

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is of great significance in fields such as autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised algorithms rely on convolutional neural networks or fixed structured Transformers, leaving room for improvement in feature capture flexibility and multi-scale fusion effectiveness. This paper proposes an unsupervised algorithm based on an adaptive pyramid Transformer and a dynamic cascaded fusion network: the encoder adopts an adaptive pyramid Transformer, which generates multi-scale features through the progressive contraction pyramid structure of PVT, and combines adaptive windows and dynamic transfer windows self-attention to flexibly capture local and global information, addressing the issue of insufficient adaptability of fixed windows to complex scenes; the decoder is a dynamic cascaded fusion network, which enhances detail recovery ability through deformable upsampling, strengthens global integration with a progressive feature fusion pyramid module, and improves feature processing specificity through dynamic convolution. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that this method, while maintaining a relatively small parameter scale, outperforms mainstream unsupervised algorithms in terms of accuracy, especially in the clarity of object boundaries and the recognition of small targets, verifying the effectiveness of the adaptive feature extraction and dynamic fusion mechanism."

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in worldwide that necessitates the early and accurate detection model. Traditional detection techniques have the issues in capturing complex tissue structures and diverse visual characteristics of gastric lesions. The advancements in medical imaging and deep learning make the automated diagnostic systems with enhanced outcomes. Thus, in this research, a novel gastric cancer detection framework is proposed with data acquisition from publicly available datasets. The acquired images are fed into the pre-processing using Wavelet-Guided Filter for removing noise by preserving features like edges and textures. Finally, the disease detection is employed using the XceptionRecurrent-based Swin Transformer (XR-STNet) model. The proposed XR-STNet approach replaces the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer with a hybrid XceptionRecurrent module. The XceptionRecurrent module integrates depth-wise separable convolutions of Xception for efficient spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for capturing sequential dependencies for enhancing the feature representation. Thus, the proposed XR-STNet architecture significantly improves the model’s ability to detect finer patterns associated with gastric cancer."

With the emergence of quantum computing, quantum machine learning (QML) presents a paradigm-shifting opportunity to improve malware detection, though its application in this domain remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate two hybrid quantumclassical models - a Quantum Multilayer Perceptron (QMLP) and a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), for malware classification. Both models utilize angle embedding to encode malware features into quantum states. QMLP captures complex patterns through full qubit measurement and data reuploading, while QCNN achieves faster training via quantum convolution and pooling layers that reduce active qubits. We evaluate both models on five widely used malware datasets -API-Graph, EMBER-Domain, EMBER-Class, AZ-Domain, and AZ-Class, across binary and multiclass classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Entanglement distribution in power grids can enable distributed quantum sensing and entanglement-based quantum key distribution, resulting in improved fault detection, real time diagnostics, provable security, etc. To distribute entanglements between remote endpoints, intermediate nodes also contribute by performing entanglement swapping to establish entangled states between these endpoints. In a power-grid network, existing routes may vary in performance over time due to unexpected traffic loads and changes in link quality. These conditions threaten the throughput of network-wide entanglement distribution. To maintain the throughput of entangled states, a quantum-enabled network needs to select ideal entanglement routes with high success rates for distribution while minimizing latency. To achieve this goal, we propose a software-defined networking (SDN) architecture that separates the data plane (responsible for entanglement distribution) from the control plane (responsible for route selection), enabling centralized monitoring and control of the quantum network. The control plane collects real-time metrics, including node resources (e.g., available qubits) and link conditions (e.g., noise levels and throughput rates). Leveraging this global network view, we implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent within the SDN control plane to dynamically identify optimal entanglement distribution paths. Simulation results on the IEEE-14 bus power grid demonstrate that our RL-based routing strategy achieved a 100 % success rate in fulfilling entanglement distribution requests."

Traditional diagnosis would be tedious and waste a lot of time depending on clinical skills, and there is bound to be delay in resource- constrained settings. The paper in question proposes a machine learning-hybrid model that could be the beginning of predicting heart disease at its very early stages on information provided by clinical decisions. The algorithm means the complex data preprocessing, characterization of features by a repetitive elimination process, and testing multiple constrained models like a Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and a Thomson bunched amalgamation. The UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Data performs cross-validation with 10-fold validation of performance. Of all the individual models, the accuracy of the stacked ensemble was larger 91.4 percent and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 95.0 percent. Explainable AI (XAI) approaches (e.g. SHAP and LIME) are added to make the process of the model decisions more transparent and to make the decisions explainable by the clinicians. The proposed framework can be useful in a clinical setting by making accurate, scalable, and interpretable predictions of risks of dealing with heart diseases."

In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route to emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and interpretative clarity."

It is found that for n-type transistors, the TDDB lifetime is lower than that in the DC condition at low frequencies AC, as the frequency increases, the lifetime exceeds the DC condition. For p-type transistors, the inflection point of the TDDB lifetime-frequency curve appears at a lower frequency. The reason is that when the stress signal frequency is low and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{a}+\\text{Vg}$</tex> bias is applied to the gate, holes are trapped in the interface layer (IL), which continuously damages the IL and causes the TDDB lifetime of NMOS transistors to be lower than the DC state at low frequencies. After the frequency increases, due to the shortening of the stress time (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{T}_{\\text{stress}}$</tex>) and the relaxation time (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$T_{\\text{relex}}$</tex>), the charging and discharging process of the oxide is inhibited, and the number of holes trapped in the IL layer decreases.

    "abstract": "Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question. The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage."

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of microservices architecture in modern distributed systems, anomaly detection and diagnosis have become key research challenges. Traditional anomaly detection methods typically rely on unimodal data, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex interactions and dynamic dependencies between service instances. On the other hand, graph-based anomaly detection methods have shown great potential in modeling complex networks and capturing system evolution patterns. However, their practical applicability is constrained by the lack of predefined graph structure data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal data anomaly detection method (VTMAD) that combines Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE) and Transformer. The method first maps the multimodal data into a unified representation of feature matrices and adjacency matrices, then captures the system's complex feature representations using VGAE. The Transformer is utilized to enhance the modeling of global dependencies and multimodal interactions. Finally, anomaly detection is performed by identifying reconstruction errors based on the adjacency matrix to locate potential system anomalies. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that the method achieves an average F1 score of 0.974, validating its outstanding performance in multimodal data anomaly detection."

These gradient-related issues can severely impact the trainability of VQCs. In this work, we propose a strategy that regularizes model parameters with prior knowledge of the training data and Gaussian noise diffusion. We conduct ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our strategy across four public datasets and demonstrate that our method can improve the trainability of VQCs against the above-mentioned gradient issues."

    "abstract": "Before quantum networks can scale up to practical sizes, there are many deployment and configuration tasks that must be automated. Currently, quantum networking testbeds are largely manually configured: network nodes are constructed out of a combination of free-space and fiber optics before being connected to shared single-photon detectors, time-todigital converters, and optical switches. Information about these connections must be tracked manually; mislabeling may result in experimental failure and protracted debugging sessions. In this paper, we propose protocols and algorithms to automate two such manual processes. First, we address the problem of automatically identifying connections between quantum network nodes and time-to-digital converters. Then, we turn to the more complex challenge of identifying the nodes attached to a quantum network's optical switches. Implementation of these protocols will help enable the development of other protocols necessary for quantum networks, such as network topology discovery, link quality monitoring, resource naming, and routing. We intend for this paper to serve as a roadmap for near-term implementation."

SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate how to craft properties of interest for its analysis. We show how to use SPAQ to find lower bounds of time to failure information, hidden node dependencies, and parameter threshold values and use that information to improve simulated quantum system availability through calibration scheme adjustments."

    "abstract": "The histopathological diagnosis of breast cancer based on imaging is one of the most important and yet most demanding tasks since the similarity between classes is high and the structure of tumor areas varies. Such common convolutional frameworks and current self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches are unable to pick up fine-grained morphological details in order to distinctly segment and classify. This article introduces a new two-phase system where a Context-Aware Dilated U-Net (CAD-U-Net) model is proposed along with a Structure-Preserving Self-Supervised Learning (SP-SSL) direction which are applied to breast histopathology issues. The proposed CAD-U-Net has replaced residual fusion block with dilation and an attention mechanism to bear greater sensitivity of boundary and be able to represent multi-scale feature. At the same time, SP-SSL likewise implements a new pretext task of patch-wise geometric restoration to pretrain the encoder without any manual labels. Manually-collated experiments on a subsample of breakhis data show that it has greatly outperformed U-Nets and contrastive SSL baselines in segmentation accuracy (Dice score: 0.912) and classification capability (F1-score: 0.938). The architecture under consideration has a strong generalization over magnification levels, and reduces false positives by 17 %. These findings emphasise the superiority of the dual-phase learning method to enhance diagnostic accuracy in the actual clinics."

This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation—also a valid metric—is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study."

    "abstract": "With the rapid digitalization of public services, privacy concerns in smart governance ecosystems have escalated, necessitating robust and interpretable risk assessment frameworks. This paper presents PrivacyX-Net, an AI-augmented architecture designed for automated multi-dimensional privacy risk evaluation from policy documents. The framework begins by encoding annotated clauses using a fine-tuned Privacy-Bert, which captures domain-specific contextual semantics. These representations are structured into a hierarchical graph, where a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) models inter-clause relationships. A Risk-Aware Attention Layer fuses outputs from both the semantic and graph-based streams to amplify high-risk contexts. Finally, a multi-label classifier predicts granular privacy risk scores across dimensions such as data collection, information sharing, data retention, and user control. The model was validated on the OPA-PolicyPrivacy dataset, achieving an F1-score of 0.89 and a Hamming loss of 0.061, outperforming existing baselines such as LSTM (F1 = 0.81) and GCN+BERT (F1 = 0.86). Extensive ablation studies and efficiency evaluations confirmed the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed architecture. Additionally, the model offers interpretability through attention visualization, supporting transparency in governance-driven decision-making. PrivacyX-Net thus enables automated, modular, and explainable privacy risk assessment, contributing significantly to the development of accountable digital infrastructures."

As opposed to traditional standalone solutions, these ecosystems are intended to facilitate everyday tasks, increase user engagement, and provide seamless integration, all of which ensure a steady stream of revenue and dedicated customer base. This analysis provides an overview of the many ecosystem models that are now transforming the technology industry. An examination of ecosystems that help businesses maintain long-term revenue sustainability and high customer retention rates is provided by the model analysis, along with insights into how ecosystems may enhance user experience by being more connected, straightforward, and user-friendly. Technology ecosystems’ quantitative effects are lacking, which makes it difficult to comprehend how they affect long-term revenue sustainability and customer retention. It is challenging to understand how technological ecosystems impact long-term revenue sustainability and customer retention due to the lack of measurable consequences. Through the use of multiple linear regression, this study illustrates the ecosystem business models’ long-term revenue and customer retention. The study visualized the relationships of the technology ecosystem with an accuracy of 90-99%. This shows how to measure ecosystem impact and gives firms data-driven insights to improve their ecosystem initiatives."

To our knowledge, our proof is the first for this protocol that is both general (in that it can handle arbitrary, asymmetric channels), and also the first that derives a bound on the quantum min entropy for general attacks, without relying on post selection techniques or the asymptotic equipartition property. Because of this, our new result shows that far more optimistic key-rates are possible for a low number of signals, even in general channels. Furthermore, our proof methods may be broadly applicable to other protocols relying on multiple measurement bases and we prove several technical lemmas that may have independent interest. We evaluate our new bound and compare to prior work, showing that higher key-rates are possible in several operating scenarios. We also show some interesting behavior of the protocol when faced with asymmetric noise."

Traditional generation methods, which typically rely on dense camera arrays or large-scale image acquisition, incur high costs, limited flexibility, inefficient workflows, and poor detail reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for converting planar images into light field images. Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to synthesize dense multi-view video sequences from sparse inputs (e.g., two images). These sequences are reconstructed into a high-fidelity 3D scenes via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), followed by shear-based rendering to extract continuous dynamic views. Finally, the rendered sequences are encoded into light field images for glasses-free 3D displays. Experimental results show that with only two input images, our method achieves SSIM <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.809$</tex> and PSNR <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=27.92$</tex>-comparable to 3DGS, while surpassing INGP-Base by 20.72% (SSIM) and 7.71% (PSNR), and exceeding M-NeRF360 by 2.27% in SSIM. This demonstrates our approach's ability to generate high-quality light field content from sparse inputs, significantly reducing acquisition time and costs while preserving fine details. The proposed framework offers a scalable solution for 3D content generation and advances practical applications of autostereoscopic displays."

While systems have advanced over the last decade, much work remains to scale quantum computers to fault-tolerance. Providing scalable light delivery is one key challenge. Current systems utilize engineered bulk- and fiber-optic-based light delivery systems, external to the vacuum chamber, to deliver arrays of beams to ions. However, fundamental optical limitations preclude the use of such systems when scaling beyond thousands of qubits. Integrated photonic-based beam delivery offers a potential solution, with encouraging proof-of-concept demonstrations from the photonics and quantum communities [2]–[5]. Quantinuum and Sandia National Labs have partnered to accelerate the development of integrated photonics for trapped-ion quantum computing applications, working towards photonic components supporting high-fidelity operations. Here, we present development of photonic integrated components designed to deliver laser light to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{Ba}^{+}$</tex> qubits, utilizing a low-loss, high-confinement, trap-integrable PECVD SiN platform. In order to demonstrate two-qubit gates at 532 nm, we developed low loss, tight bend waveguides, efficient edge couplers, and asymmetric multimode interference (MMI) splitters, along with beam-forming grating out-couplers delivering gaussian beams at the ion plane.

Building on recent advances in calibration measures, we propose two new measures: the generalized uncertainty calibration error and its normalized version. These measures unify and extend the concepts of estimator credibility and regression calibration to multivariate settings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the characteristics of credibility and calibration measures, including the proposed measures, and their applicability to regression models."

While modern teaching methods are gradually being adopted to improve accessibility, rural schools continue to face significant hurdles, including limited infrastructure and a shortage of qualified teachers. These challenges often undermine the effectiveness of traditional educational approaches. Although digital tools have enhanced engagement and teaching quality in urban settings, rural areas still struggle with access and implementation. To bridge this gap, the current research proposes a cost-effective adaptive learning framework that integrates reinforcement learning and Explainable AI (XAI). This system is designed to support personalized learning, increase accessibility, and enhance instructional efficiency, even in resource-constrained environments. By offering AI-driven learning paths, offline access, and intelligent teacher support features, the framework aims to make education more inclusive and impactful for rural students.

Pearson’s heat map was used to understand the correlation between the process parameters and the strength. The results emphasize that weld time dictates the Tensile Strength (Mpa) and Yield Strength (Mpa) predominantly followed by marginal impact created by other two parameters. However, it is imperative to optimize these parameters in order to arrive at requisite strength and quality as per the acceptable standards.

This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a comprehensive, user-driven framework for the development of integrated evaluation tools. We illustrate this framework through the case study of the development of the eXtended User Experience Questionnaire (X-UEQ), a novel 12-item module. Its six dimensions-perceived realism, agency, sensory engagement, interface quality, active exploration, and selfevaluation of performance-are theoretically grounded in established presence models and empirically derived from a qualitative study with 25 participants. The main contribution is twofold: a replicable, user-centered methodology and the resulting validation-ready tool that provides a necessary bridge between traditional usability evaluation and immersive presence evaluation."

    "abstract": "Quantum networks will enable long-distance entanglement distribution through repeater nodes capable of both generating external Bell pairs with their neighbors—independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with probability p—and performing internal Bell State Measurements (BSMs), which succeed with probability q. These probabilities depend on the specific experimental parameters of the network. While global link state knowledge can maximize entanglement generation rates between any two consumers, it is often impractical due to the network's dynamic nature. This work evaluates a multipath routing protocol based on local link state knowledge, designed for time-multiplexed repeaters that can perform BSMs across different time steps. We employ simulations across various network topologies to characterize how consumer placement and network topology influence the utility of dynamic and static routing strategies. Results show that increasing the time multiplexing block length, k, enhances the average entanglement generation rate, though at the cost of higher initial latency. When a step-function memory decoherence model is introduced—where qubits are stored in quantum memory for a time that follows an exponential distribution—an optimal k emerges. As p decreases or the average memory lifetime increases, this optimal k grows, reflecting a trade-off where the advantages of time multiplexing must be balanced against the heightened risk of losing previously established entangled pairs."

    "abstract": "Surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based acoustofluidics has shown great potential for manipulating micro- and nanoparticles, enabling applications such as acoustic centrifugation and particle patterning. However, conventional SAW devices fabricated through photolithography and metal deposition suffer from long processing times and lack structural tunability after fabrication. In this study, a functionally tunable acoustofluidic device based on a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) is proposed. By mechanically clamping interdigital electrodes (IDEs) on the FPCB to a piezoelectric substrate and incorporating an impedance-matching network, efficient SAW excitation is achieved. The device enables rapid enrichment of polystyrene (PS) particles ranging from 500 nm to 5 μm. Moreover, controlled patterning of 10 μm particles is realized using a magnetically attached rotating fixture, which adjusts the acoustic wave propagation direction on the substrate to excite different acoustic modes. This modular and reconfigurable FPCB-SAW device offers an adaptable platform for rapid functional validation of SAW systems and facilitates broader applications of acoustofluidic technology."

This is underscored by the United Nations� proclamation of 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, with the stated aim “to use the occasion of 100 years of quantum mechanics in 2025 to help raise public awareness of the importance and impact of quantum science and applications on all aspects of life.” To mark this occasion, the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre brought together a consortium of fifteen institutions to showcase quantum science and technology research and innovation from across the UK. This consortium came together to develop public engagement demonstrations for 'The Quantum Zone' exhibit at the Royal Society's Summer Science Exhibition 2025. These demos showcased quantum concepts and components, as well as quantum technologies and examples of their applications. By taking a collaborative approach to the exhibit, the group was able to take part in a large-scale public engagement activity, allowing resource requirements to be shared across multiple institutions. It also enabled over 160 quantum researchers and professionals to access quantum-specific public engagement training, laying the groundwork for the establishment of a quantum outreach community of practice in the UK. Over the course of six days, the exhibit enabled 7871 “meaningful interactions” with members of the UK public visiting the Summer Science exhibition. This talk will discuss the process of planning, managing, delivering and evaluating the Quantum Zone exhibit. We will share our key findings on best practices, lessons learned and future work in this area."

    "abstract": "Fluid antennas (FAs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems owing to their flexible antenna positions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of FA-enabled ISAC for showcasing the significant potential of FAs in enhancing ISAC systems. On this basis, we propose an innovative air-ground collaborative framework that incorporates FAs to tackle complex tasks involving sensing for data acquisition, communication for information exchange, and computation for data processing. In this framework, the collaboration relationship between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and an FA-equipped remote base station (BS) is explored to complete the complex tasks. Specifically, multiple UAVs sense ground targets by transmitting radar signals. Upon receiving radar echoes, each UAV processes sensing data in collaboration with the BS by offloading a part of the sensing data to the BS. To facilitate cooperation, we utilize the radar estimation rate to characterize sensing performance and design a synergistic algorithm to coordinate the positions of FAs, the receive beamforming of the BS, computation resource allocation, task offloading ratios, and UAV deployment to minimize the average task completion delay in data processing, subject to sensing performance requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms several baselines in terms of the average task completion delay."

    "abstract": "This work presents an enhancement-mode (E-mode) p-GaN HEMT that significantly improves gate reliability and breakdown voltage through a post-annealing-free oxygen plasma treatment (GOPT). This method forms a GaOxN1x interfacial layer beneath the gate metal, increasing the gate breakdown voltage from 13.8 V to 24.8 V and reducing the gate leakage current by three orders of magnitude at VGS=8 V, compared to conventional Schottky p-GaN gates. Time-dependent gate breakdown (TDGB) testing predicts a maximum safe operating gate voltage of 9.2 V for a 10-year lifetime with a 63% failure probability. The fabricated GOPT p-GaN HEMTs show excellent off-state drain breakdown performance, with a voltage of up to 2940 V at a gate-to-drain distance of 28 5m. This approach offers a simplified fabrication process with superior performance in both gate reliability and high-voltage capability, establishing GOPT p-GaN HEMTs as a promising candidate for highperformance, high-reliability power electronics."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing pre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system to generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, agentQ implements the mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum circuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 4, 0 0 0}$</tex> quantum circuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show superior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and better parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic workflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in quantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware."

    "abstract": "Stress has become a prevalent issue in daily life, often arising from challenging situations that can adversely affect mental health and lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney failure. As a natural response, stress encourages us to confront various threats or obstacles, however, our coping mechanisms significantly influence our overall health and well-being, making effective stress management essential for a balanced life. Recent advancements in stress detection have highlighted photoplethysmography (PPG) as an effective non-invasive method. The Dataset containing physiological signals data such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and galvanic skin response data, alongside self-reported stress levels. The collected data underwent preprocessing to structure it for analysis, followed by feature extraction to identify key physiological patterns relevant to stress classification. A multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier was then applied to categorize stress levels based on these features, achieved an impressive accuracy of $99.21 \\%$ in stress classification. These findings underscore the significance of these metrics in predicting stress."

The system is constructed on the Arduino platform and can combine and stream real-time data on a locally available reader. Correlations of PTT with robust negative data above 0.85 in systolic, 0.72 in diastolic, and 0.81 in mean arterial blood pressure were confirmed in 25 subjects and thus pointed on the validity of the regression-based blood pressure estimates regression model. Their temperature recording registered <0.5 percent error concerning a digital thermometer, and the heart rate was within acceptable deviation ranges. Its low price (~4400 INR), modular design, and future possibilities (cloud connectivity and AI-based diagnostics) make the device a relevant breakthrough in the field of personal health monitoring in general and poor rural communities in particular. These results prove the potential of the system to lower the number of visits to hospitals, facilitate the detection of health abnormalities at an early stage, and facilitate telemedicine applications that can be scaled."

    "abstract": "The underrepresentation of women and girls in STEM is a global issue influenced by various social, cultural, and institutional factors, including gender stereotypes, limited engagement opportunities, and insufficient support from educators. Early interventions are essential, and teachers require effective tools and strategies for delivering STEM education that is both enjoyable and inclusive. The TechLARP Erasmus+ project aims to upskill prospective and current STEM educators in genderinclusive and arts-based approaches to deliver engaging STEM education to children and youth. This paper presents the results of good practices currently in place to engage children and young students in STEM through arts-based approaches. We identified various interventions, their contributions, requirements, and challenges they address. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in implementing technology-related interventions using arts-based approaches, most of which were run in European countries. We analyzed the interviews to identify the main themes that could inspire the design of future interventions. The research offers preliminary insights into key characteristics to consider when designing engaging and inclusive STEM experiences. The study revealed diverse, creative approaches-such as design thinking, role-playing, embodied learning, and maker spaces-that effectively engage young learners. It also highlighted common factors in scalability, replicability, skill development, and collaboration between stakeholders. These findings address two key issues: the need for teacher training in gender-inclusive STEM education and the development of strategies to boost girls' interest and skills in STEM. Future steps of this research will include an in-depth analysis of the results in comparison to the relevant literature on current practices. These will help design extensive guidelines to support educators in implementing arts-based practices."

In this work, we introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures, with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era."

The analysis relied on an openly available dataset containing information about the different crops, states, years, area, and production. The data was cleaned, and featurization was performed before classifying the crop yields into \"High\" or \"Low\". The models were trained on the dataset and evaluated using common classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The empirical results showed that logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 99.82% which was higher than the Random Forest Classifier, achieving 99.47%. Although their accuracy is displayed as being different, the Logistic Regression provides a better tradeoff between the precision and recall, being both effective and interpretable enough for use in the real world. Therefore, machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forest provide a considerable potential for reliable crop yield forecasts, and thus improved agricultural planning and decision-making."

The study aims to address this gap by conducting a comparative analysis between the Durban University of Technology (DUT) in South Africa and the University of Ibadan (UI) in Nigeria. This analysis aims to enhance ethics governance and deliberative strategies for experimental engineering research. The comparative analysis will provide valuable insights for improving ethical practices and decision-making processes in both institutions. The study employs a qualitative methodology based on ethics committee reports, faculty interviews, and curriculum audits from both institutions. Findings reveal that ethical risk is often overlooked in experimental work involving engineered materials, prototype testing, energy systems, and environmental interventions. The absence of formal ethical review for such research not only exposes institutions to reputational risk but also limits the development of ethically conscious engineers."

Our results demonstrate that these optimizations enable the successful execution of the quantum regression algorithm on current hardware. Furthermore, the techniques presented are broadly applicable to other quantum circuits requiring arbitrary real-valued state preparation, advancing the practical implementation of quantum algorithms."

    "abstract": "Predicting loan eligibility with high accuracy remains a significant challenge in the finance sector. Accurate predictions enable financial institutions to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and effectively adapt services to meet customer needs. However, the complexity and the highdimensional nature of financial data have always posed significant challenges to achieving this level of precision. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that employs Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for Loan Eligibility Prediction using Quantum Neural Networks (LEP-QNN). Our innovative approach achieves an accuracy of 98 % in predicting loan eligibility from a single, comprehensive dataset. This performance boost is attributed to the strategic implementation of a dropout mechanism within the quantum circuit, aimed at minimizing overfitting and thereby improving the model's predictive reliability. In addition, our exploration of various optimizers leads to identifying the most efficient setup for our LEPQNN framework, optimizing its performance. We also rigorously evaluate the resilience of LEP-QNN under different quantum noise scenarios, ensuring its robustness and dependability for quantum computing environments. This research showcases the potential of QML in financial predictions and establishes a foundational guide for advancing QML technologies, marking a step towards developing advanced, quantum-driven financial decision-making tools."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, making it crucial for privacy-sensitive applications. However, optimizing the tradeoff between communication rounds and local rounds poses a challenge, especially in industrial scenarios with a limited number of clients. Unlike conventional FL setups with many participants, industrial FL often involves only a few clients, requiring an efficient balance between CRs and LRs to maximize model performance within a fixed training budget. This study systematically evaluates the impact of varying CRs and LRs while keeping the total number of training iterations constant. Using the CIFAR100 dataset and DenseNet-121, we compare FL training from scratch against pre-trained models initialized with ImageNet weights. Our results reveal that FL can achieve comparable accuracy across varying CR-to-LR ratios when the total number of training iterations is fixed. Specifically, non-pretrained models achieved a peak accuracy of $\\mathbf{5 4. 6 1 \\%}$, whereas pre-trained models reached $83.67 \\%$, surpassing centralized DenseNet-121 training without augmentation $(82.62 \\%)$. Furthermore, we examine the influence of non-IID client data distributions, highlighting that strategic class allocation improves FL performance in industrial applications. These insights provide practical guidelines for configuring FL systems under resource constraints."

    "abstract": "The integration of the Internet of Things with Wireless Sensor Networks introduces complex challenges related to energy efficiency and data security, particularly in the context of emerging quantum threats. This paper proposes the Quantum-Enhanced Nature-Inspired Routing Algorithm (QENI-RA), a secure and energy-aware routing framework designed for large-scale IoT-WSNs. QENI-RA leverages a hybrid optimization strategy that combines quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization, chaotic Lévy flight exploration, and Sobol sequence-based initialization to dynamically select energy-optimal cluster heads and multi-hop paths. Security is reinforced through a dual-layer cryptographic scheme that integrates BB84-based quantum key distribution for key exchange and Kyber lattice-based encryption for data confidentiality, offering resilience against both classical and quantum adversaries. Extensive simulations conducted using NS-3 across network sizes ranging from 50 to 5,000 nodes demonstrate that QENI-RA reduces average energy consumption by 17.6%, extends network lifetime (time to first node death) by 24.3%, and improves the packet delivery ratio by 9.8%, compared to state-of-the-art quantum-inspired protocols such as QBER and QPSOFL. Furthermore, the proposed framework incurs only a 3.4% throughput overhead while maintaining high levels of security. These findings position QENI-RA as a robust and scalable solution for secure, sustainable routing in next-generation IoT sensor networks."

Conventional systems are prone to tampering in the election process due to poor identity verification and the inability to prevent duplicate votes. In this electronic voting system, fingerprint authentication is carried out using the ESP32 microcontroller to limit voting to registered voters, ensuring that every voter can vote only once and cannot impersonate another voter. Votes are locally buffered in EEPROM and sent using a web API to Google Sheets in the cloud, where they can be tracked remotely. The LCD screen provides instant feedback, and the automation of the Blynk IoT platform enables remote tracking of vote counting, member registration, and system data reset."

In this context, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling solution for privacy-preserving model training across distributed edge devices. However, the effectiveness of FL in real-world scenarios remains limited due to the lack of user participation incentives and inefficient device selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel FL framework that combines a one-sided matching theory-based incentive mechanism to encourage active user engagement by aligning user preferences and system rewards. The main significance of the work is to enhance learning efficiency under volatile communication conditions, we introduce device-to-device (D2D) collaboration and channel state prediction using Echo State Networks (ESNs) to anticipate and mitigate poor network links. For model optimization, we adopt a lightweight DenseNet-based architecture that runs locally on user devices, offering efficient feature extraction while maintaining high predictive accuracy and low computational overhead. This setup significantly reduces the training time and energy footprint, making it suitable for latency-sensitive, resource-constrained 6G environments. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior convergence time reduction and energy consumption savings compared to traditional FL schemes, while also ensuring fair utility distribution among users."

    "abstract": "Residential smart meters data is essential for load flow analysis and demand-supply balance in smart grids. However, centralized load forecasting methods compromise consumer privacy and lead to high communication overhead due to the transmission of sensitive data. Federated learning (FL) addresses these concerns by enabling decentralized model training. However, traditional FL models rely on computationally intensive architectures, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are not suitable for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, a single global FL model fails to account for diverse household consumption patterns, resulting in suboptimal forecasting performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel federated averaging (FedAvg) approach based on integrate-and-fire (IF) spiking neurons for short-term load forecasting (STLF). Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide event-driven, energy-efficient processing, reducing computational complexity and communication costs. In addition, we introduce a parameter-based clustering mechanism that leverages the statistical properties of model updates to group households with similar consumption patterns. Our method enhances model aggregation and effectively captures user-specific consumption patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of 18 homes demonstrate that our FedAvg-IF model reduces RMSE by approximately $74 \\%$ and MAE by $82 \\%$ compared to the FedAvgLSTM model. The introduction of the clustering mechanism (FedAvg-IF-C) further decreases communication costs by about $89 \\%$ and computational time by $61 \\%$, respectively."

    "abstract": "Active teaching methods and adaptive learning are used in engineering education to encourage competency development. Although learning analysis must be based on competencies to monitor the progress of each student, little is known about the relationship between active methods and competency development. Since it is difficult to track active methods that guide students and teachers through the teaching-learning process, we aimed at creating an educational approach to map and correlate competencies, providing recommendations for learning objects, enabling adaptive learning through artificial intelligence. We hypothesized it is possible to track the active methods used and the related competencies based on the recommendation of learning objects. First, we defined the analysis of competencybased learning as its theme, exploring the relationship between competencies, active methods and learning objects. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to map competencies, as it clarifies which active methods develop which competencies. The Open University dataset was used to train AI models. A learning object recommendation strategy was proposed, making it possible to trace the competencies and active methods used. The AI-based recommendation guides adaptive learning by course, class, or student. The use of the AHP method was promising, simplifying the recommendation system. The performance of the AI models was efficient, predicting learning objects in an adaptive way according to student profile. This is the first study that focused on competencies and traceability according to teaching method. Real data from universities can further improve our model that has been validated by research data."

Traditional quantum error correction (QEC) is effective but resource-intensive, requiring several extra qubits and operations beyond the reach of near-term devices. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) offers a complementary path by reducing the impact of error prior to full correction. We present an adaptive pulse-level QEM using genetic algorithms to dynamically adjust control pulses in real-time, improving algorithm fidelity without modifying the logic structure of a quantum circuit. By targeting pulse parameters directly, this method reduces the impact of various noise sources, improving algorithm resilience in quantum circuits. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we apply our protocol to five key quantum algorithms, including Bernstein-Vazirani, DeutschJozsa, Grover's search, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), and its inverse (IQFT). Experimental results show that our pulse-level optimization strategy provides a flexible and efficient solution for increasing fidelity during the noisy execution of quantum circuits.

However, existing GrC frameworks often suffer from limited feature extraction capabilities and struggle to efficiently process high dimensional data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an innovative unified computational framework that seamlessly integrates autoencoders with GrC methods, aiming to enhance high-dimensional data classification. The proposed framework comprises three core layers: an autoencoder layer, a hyperspherical layer, and a classifier layer. The autoencoder layer reduces the dimensionality of high-dimensional inputs by learning low-dimensional latent representations through an encoding-decoding mechanism, preserving essential nonlinear features. The hyperspherical layer introduces a hyperspherical information granulation mechanism, guided by a multi-granularity loss function to further organize and refine the data representation. Finally, the structured data is classified using a fully connected classifier. This end-to-end framework enables joint training of feature extraction, granulation, and classification components, significantly boosting classification performance and effectively addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, while also ensuring strong adaptability across diverse data environments and maintaining robust generalization to unseen or complex classification tasks."

These quantum algorithms, expressed as quantum circuits, need to be translated to a set of instructions from a defined quantum instruction-set architecture (ISA), which are executed by the control hardware. These translations can be done by a compiler, targeting different qubit technologies. Specifically for diamond NV centers, no compiler exists to perform this translation. Therefore, in this paper we present a compiler designed for quantum computers utilizing diamond NV center specific instructions, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps, to reduce execution times and gate count. Additionally, our compiler adds on top of general compilers by allowing classical instructions to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations. The output of the compiler is tested in a diamond NV center specific simulator. Comparing a general compiler output with the diamond NV center specific output of our compiler while applying decoherence and depolarization noise showed reduced noise effects due to diamond specific decomposition. The compiler was also tested to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations, which showed to be functional. Our results show that we have successfully created a compiler with integrated classical and quantum instructions support, which can improve circuit execution fidelity by utilizing diamond specific optimizations."

    "abstract": "Binary optimization problems are emerging as potential candidates for useful applications of quantum computing. Among quantum algorithms, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is currently considered the most promising method to obtain a quantum advantage for such problems. The QAOA method uses a classical counterpart to perform optimization in a hybrid approach. In this paper, we show that the recently introduced method called quantum circuit evolutionary (QCE) also has potential for applications in binary optimization problems. This methodology is classical optimizer-free, but, for some scenarios, may have convergence stagnation as a consequence of smooth circuit modifications at each generation. To avoid this drawback and accelerate the convergence capabilities of QCE, we introduce a framework using an adaptive cost function (ACF), which varies dynamically with the circuit evolution. This procedure accelerates the convergence of the method. Applying this new approach to instances of the set partitioning problem, we show that QCE-ACF achieves convergence performance identical to QAOA but with a shorter execution time. Finally, experiments in the presence of induced noise show that this framework is quite suitable for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era."

The AXI bus provides an openstandard, on-chip interconnect specification that enables efficient IP reuse, flexibility, compatibility, high bandwidth, and low latency [8]. It defines a point-to-point protocol between two interfaces: a manager and a subordinate. In our SoC product, Logic Build in Self-Test (LBIST) was implemented on both the manager and subordinate sides respectively[9], with corresponding AXI LBIST pattern executed on Automated Test Equipment (ATE). Diagnosis analysis could localize failed FIFO cell in manager or subordinate when a failure was detected by LBIST pattern. This paper presents AXI bus LBIST hardware structure and test sequence, outlines the diagnosis flow for AXI LBIST failures, and demonstrates diagnosis accuracy through two real cases. Establishing AXI LBIST diagnosis capability in FA lab significantly improved Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): success rate increased from 50% to nearly 100% and analysis time was reduced from 90 days to 45 days. Built in SelfTest (BIST) structure and diagnosis enabled quick and easy root cause isolation for failed FIFO cells compared to traditional SoC functional analysis. However, now it must still be performed manually, and current AXI LBIST diagnosis was limited in narrowing down suspicions for controlling signals in AXI bus."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is considered to be one of the most lethal malignancies, and the protection and individual approach to the treatment are the key clinical issues. The recent development in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) has shown the potential of revolution in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), radiomics, and genomics are all techniques that allow automated extraction of features on imaging and molecular data, and allow earlier detection, precise risk stratification and personalized treatment plans. Uses of AI in medicine are in computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection, biomarkers discovery, treatment response prediction, and clinical decision support. In spite of these developments, issues of model interpretability, privacy of data, cross-population validation and ethical factors have limited clinical use on a large scale. This paper will survey existing AI-based approaches to detecting and treating lung cancer and its clinical implications, limitations in practice, and future opportunities. The combination of multimodal data, explainable AI, and federated learning can be used to build better precision in oncology in the future and make AI a dependable instrument in the improvement of lung cancer outcomes."

    "abstract": "Surface ion traps have lithographically defined electrode geometries that can be accurately simulated to calculate the voltages needed to store and transport ions, an enabling capability for trapped-ion quantum computing. While these voltage waveforms can be described explicitly as a voltage for each time step, they can be represented more compactly using cubic splines with coefficients calculated from the explicit target waveform. An FPGA would then calculate voltages on-the-fly based on these coefficients with a simple addition loop, sending these values as the input to digital-to-analog converters. Using cubic spline interpolation also increases the flexibility of the control system by simplifying the calibration offsets and time-scaling of waveforms without requiring additional explicit samples. In this paper we show that a single RF system-on-chip can be used to control 100 DAC channels, and propose a system-level architecture that uses scatter gather direct memory access and a highly compact custom data structure to store and generate voltage control waveforms in real-time."

While many studies focus on RAT infection methods and inherent capabilities, post-exploitation activities that occur after the initial infection and command and control are seldom discussed due to difficulties of observation. This paper presents a dedicated analysis environment designed for the long-term observation of RAT post-exploitations within a simulated multi-host enterprise network. Our environment imposes no time constraints on RAT execution and supports on-demand collection of diverse artifacts, enabling detailed monitoring from initial C2 connection to termination of activity. We conducted experiments using 41 samples from 7 RAT families collected over six-months and analyzed the observed post-exploitations in terms of tactics, techniques, and corresponding artifacts, as well as C2 communications. The contributions of this paper include the design of a long-term analysis environment and empirical insights into contemporary RAT post-exploitations."

    "abstract": "Modern distributed systems generate fragmented, heterogeneous logs that challenge traditional anomaly detection methods relying solely on event counts or sequential patterns. We propose LogWF, a novel workflow graph-based approach that addresses these limitations by explicitly modeling spatiotemporal relationships in distributed system execution. Our method first extracts structured event templates and constructs a three-dimensional tensor (time × host × template) through FastText embeddings and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting, followed by tensor decomposition for dimensionality reduction. By mining temporal invariants via Linear Temporal Logic and model checking with McScM, we build node-specific workflow graphs that capture event transition probabilities. These subgraphs are unified through adjacency matrix fusion and breadth-first traversal to form a comprehensive system-wide workflow graph. A Graph Convolutional Neural Network with self-attention pooling then performs wholegraph anomaly detection, preserving structural patterns while emphasizing critical nodes. The framework shows exceptional robustness against log noise (maintaining $\\gt0.988 \\mathrm{~F} 1$ at $30 \\%$ duplication/loss) and scalability (0.935 F1 with 500-node graphs), significantly reducing false positives through explicit modeling of distributed system execution paths. This work advances log analysis by transforming fragmented logs into interpretable workflow graphs that simultaneously encode temporal, spatial, and semantic relationships for precise diagnosis of anomalies."

    "abstract": "Air handwriting recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential in enabling natural and contactless human-computer interaction. However, challenges such as real-time processing, multi-character composition, and segmentation of continuous gestures remain unresolved. This paper introduces a novel framework for real-time air handwriting recognition, leveraging dynamic hand gesture segmentation and a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Utilizing the MediaPipe framework for hand tracking and the EMNIST dataset for training, our system captures finger trajectories, processes them into normalized 2D arrays, and predicts characters with high accuracy. A unique feature of our approach is the use of hand-closing gestures (e.g., forming a fist) as a dynamic segmentation mechanism, enabling seamless word formation without the need for artificial constraints like virtual boxes. Empirical results demonstrate 95% training accuracy and 91% test accuracy on the EMNIST dataset, with a real-time latency of 0.72 seconds. Furthermore, our system dynamically caches recognized characters, allowing users to compose words naturally until a termination gesture or button press is detected. Despite these advancements, challenges such as skewed inputs from various writing tools highlight the need for adaptive preprocessing techniques. This work bridges the gap between single-character recognition and practical word-level applications, offering valuable insights for future HCI systems. The proposed framework not only enhances the accuracy and usability of air handwriting recognition but also provides a robust foundation for real-world deployment in diverse environments."

We established a controlled simulations involving various numbers of malicious clients and MPC nodes. Our result showed that Semi2k offers limited protection against min-max attacks, showing no advantage over non-MPC setups in short training runs. However, it significantly improves accuracy under label-flipping attacks at 500 iterations, though overall accuracy declines with more malicious clients. Longer training improves resilience to label-flipping but increases communication overhead. Communication costs grow linearly with participants, highlighting a trade-off between scalability and efficiency."

Most HQC algorithms involve iterative exchanges of data between quantum and classical processors, causing system bottlenecks and leading to high latency in applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies quantum and reconfigurable resources for HQC algorithms, to mitigate system bottlenecks and latency. The proposed framework integrates Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with quantum processing units (QPUs) for deploying HQC algorithms. Classical subroutines of the algorithms are accelerated on FPGA fabric using a high-throughput processing pipeline, while quantum subroutines are executed on QPUs. High-level software is used to seamlessly facilitate workload distribution and data exchange between classical and quantum processors. To evaluate the proposed framework, an HQC algorithm, namely variational quantum classification and MNIST dataset are used as a test case. The results demonstrate that the FPGA pipeline achieves up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8 \\times$</tex> improvement in runtime compared to the baseline of a state-of-the-art quantum software framework running on a server-grade CPU."

    "abstract": "Flip chip technology, as an important innovation in the field of semiconductor packaging, has received extensive attention and application in recent years. Currently, flip chip pull-off test is one of the methods for evaluating the reliability of flip chip technology. However, during the testing process, there is a phenomenon of substrate bending, which leads to a decrease in the reliability of the test. To address this issue, this paper explores an innovative method to effectively improve the substrate bending phenomenon. By comparing the test results of two test approaches before and after improvement using samples of the same batch and model, and by using the COMSOL model constructed, the changes in substrate stress during the testing process of the two test approaches before and after improvement can be determined. Due to the consistency between the simulation results and the test results, the accuracy and reliability of the improved approach are verified. Therefore, this approach is a more advantageous flip chip pull-off test approach."

    "abstract": "These days, satellite remote sensing data is employed for different drone applications. The main goal is to provide imaginary information about electromagnetic locations and patterns of geolocations insight into Earth. The Internet of Drone Things (IoDT) exploits remote sensing data to deliver medicine from source to destination. However, many existing medicine delivery systems based on drones need longer execution times and more efficiency in delivering medicine to the right destinations. This paper presents transfer learning, which empowers a spatiotemporal remote sensing data training system for medicine delivery in edge cloud networks based on IoDT applications. The objective is to deliver the medicine to the original destination with the highest score and process all drone tasks based on their given deadlines. We present the offloading spatiotemporal training and scheduling (OSPTS) algorithm methodology that completes the data collection process and medicine delivery in different locations. Therefore, we solve the problem as a combinatorial problem and find the optimal solution based on searching and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Transfer learning and convolutional neural networks are sub-schemes of the OSPTS that train the remote sensing data on edge nodes and point clouds for optimal medicine delivery. Simulation results show that the OSPTS obtained the highest score for medicine delivery in the correct position with less processing time than existing systems."

    "abstract": "Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) provide crucial support for ubiquitous connectivity, whereas the inherent openness poses significant security threats. Covert communication that achieves intrinsic protection by concealing transmission behavior has become an ideal solution. This work studies a downlink covert satellite communication scenario under signal overlay. Existing research mostly carries out optimizations in the power domain. However, since waveforms serve as the physical carriers of information, their design critically impacts the covert communication performance via different adjustability to channel state information (CSI). Specifically, blindly enhancing demodulation reliability does not necessarily lead to better covert capacity and may even be counterproductive. OFDM is vulnerable to carrier frequency offset, while OTFS lacks the flexibility to accommodate CSI, resulting in difficulties applying existing candidate waveforms. In light of this, we propose a nimble waveform named orthogonal fractional dual index multiplexing (OFDIM) tolerant of fractional delay and Doppler. It enables common modulation schemes through integer indices and creates a fractional domain resilient to CSI. The closed-forms of the maximum covert transmit power, reliability, and spectral efficiency are derived. Fractional indices are optimized to improve the performance based on CSI. Simulations validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the benefits of the fractional domain in covert communication. Additionally, OFDIM incorporates a complementary security mechanism where the indices can act as dynamic ciphers and guarantee certain security even if the communication behavior is exposed."

    "abstract": "Equal angular interval sampling (EAISP) is currently one of the primary approaches used for bearing fault diagnosis under variable-speed conditions. Accurate acquisition of rotational speed is a prerequisite for this method. Hardware-based speed measurement and algorithm-based speed estimation are the two most commonly employed approaches. The former requires high-precision sensors such as encoders, which are costly and sensitive to environmental factors. The latter relies on a specific algorithm model and requires high data quality, resulting in limited generality and scalability. This study explores a hybrid approach that combines hardware-based measurement with algorithmic speed estimation. In this method, a single Hall sensor with low accuracy but low cost and strong environmental adaptability is used to initially perform a rough measurement of rotational speed. Then, a method named kurtosis-based spectral index guided Polynomial Approximation (KSIGPA) is proposed to achieve an accurate estimation of the rotational speed. Simulation and experiment verify that this strategy is between the existing hardware-based speed measurement and algorithm-based speed estimation, and it has a good application prospect in the scenarios where only rough speed can be obtained and it is impossible or inconvenient to install high-precision sensors."

In this study, we propose a hybrid demodulation scheme-enabled ISAC beamforming design to enhance sensing capabilities. Our study delves into the combined effects of diverse users’ demodulation schemes and sensing power constraints on the design of transmit beamforming for multi-user communication and multi-target sensing. We formulate three optimization problems for beamforming design which tackle user-target discrimination, user-target overlap, and a general hybrid scenario. In particular, in the hybrid scenario, we incorporate the type of communication receivers as an optimized variable and introduce additional sensing power constraints to enhance sensing performance in terms of beampattern and time waveform without compromising communication performance. To effectively tackle these optimization challenges, we introduce a hierarchical convex relaxation framework considering user-target pairing. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed beamforming approach improves sensing performance while maintaining communication performance, surpassing traditional designs under different user-target directional distributions."

    "abstract": "Accurate crop field boundary extraction from high resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for agricultural management. However, fragmented boundaries and limited model transferability, particularly in areas with complex terrain and smallholder farming, remain major challenges. This study introduces SEV-Field, a framework combining semantic segmentation, edge detection, and boundary post-processing to address these issues. The framework uses a Swin Transformer model for semantic segmentation to delineate field extents and the EDTER model for edge detection. A Vector Boundary Connection and Extent Filtering (VBC-EF) method is then applied to reconnect fragmented boundaries and enhance connectivity. Evaluated on high-resolution Jilin-1 satellite imagery in Yibin, China, SEV-Field achieved a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.92 for field extent and 0.83 for boundary. Additionally, the framework demonstrated a 10% improvement in boundary connectivity, measured by average path length similarity (APLS), after post-processing. Cross-regional validation across multiple Chinese provinces and satellite sources (Jilin-1, Sentinel-2) confirmed the framework ' s strong transferability, achieving an mIoU of 0.90 in Meishan (Sichuan) and 0.86 in Yulin (Shaanxi) without retraining. SEV-Field effectively addresses boundary discontinuity and generalizes across diverse geographical and imaging conditions, offering a scalable solution for precision agriculture."

To investigate the memory characteristics of discrete second-order memristors and their influence on chaotic maps, a new discrete second-order memristor is proposed, and its memory characteristics are investigated. Subsequently, a novel four-dimensional hyperchaotic mapping(4D-HM) is obtained by coupling it with the traditional chaotic mapping. Then, the chaotic characteristics of hyperchaotic map is investigated by the Bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and the phase diagram of the 4D-HM. It is worth mentioning that the phenomenon of coexistence of attractors has been discovered in the 4D-HM. This feature makes the 4D-HM more suitable for many chaotic based engineering applications. Therefore, the 4D-HM is applied to the field of image encryption. To demonstrate the security and reliability of the encryption scheme, the simulation results of the scheme are analyzed. Finally, the process of theoretical analysis of the 4D-HM is demonstrated by DSP implementation. Because of its complex dynamical characteristics, the 4D-HM has great potential application value."

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of GPS-equipped edge devices, huge trajectory data are generated and accumulated in various domains, driving numerous urban applications. However, due to the limited data acquisition capabilities of edge devices, many trajectories are often recorded at low sampling rates, reducing the effectiveness of these applications. To address this issue, we aim to recover high-sample-rate trajectories from low-sample-rate ones enhancing the usability of trajectory data. Recent approaches to trajectory recovery often assume centralized data storage, which can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. This not only poses privacy risks but also degrades performance in decentralized settings where data streams into the system incrementally.

To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose an intra-domain knowledge distillation module. Additionally, LightTR+ features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme, which reduces communication costs between the server and clients, further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of LightTR+."

    "abstract": "Convolution is fundamental in digital signal processing across many applications. Existing works enable N-point linear convolution via N-point right-angle circular convolution (RCC) based on weighted transforms, effectively removing the need for zero padding. However, these methods are constrained by their choice of weights, which impacts the complexity of weight-related multiplications at the start of the transform and the end of the inverse transform. This limitation leads to either reduced accuracy or increased complexity in weighted Fourier transform (WFT)-based convolution, as well as restricted transform lengths in weighted Fermat number transform (WFNT)-based convolution. In this work, we address these challenges by merging the multiplications by weights into the butterfly structures with arbitrary power-of-2 radix for both WFT and WFNT. We also propose an extraction method to accommodate negative and complex numbers. Our work ensures that weights do not increase complexity, thereby improving accuracy and reducing complexity in WFT-based convolution, while allowing for a broader range of transform lengths in WFNT-based convolution."

    "abstract": "Differential Dermal Potential (DDP) signals are being used recently with significant success for monitoring and evaluating various human conditions like restfulness, hypertension, posture change and also cognitive load. Hence, innovative models of this signal can be used with advantage in further studies. It is known that Kalman Filter (KF) models have been successfully used to represent various time-series signals including biosignals like speech, ECG and EEG signals. This paper proposes a new variant of the KF model termed as the finite difference based KF (KF-FD) model. Its novelty lies primarily in the formulation of the underlying finite difference based state space (FD-SS) model derived from the stochastic polynomial form of the time-series signals obtained in the pre-established stochastic autocorrelation function-zero crossing lag (ACF-ZCL) model. In this paper, the proposed KF-FD model of DDP signals is compared with the conventional Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPC) based KF model (KF-LPC) of these signals. Restfulness is a crucial yet often overlooked component of overall well-being, influencing cognitive function, emotional stability, and physical health. This study further explores the assessment of restfulness of human subjects based on the characteristics of the estimated parameters from both KF models of the DDP signals. The results demonstrate that while the parameters of the KF-LPC model can identify the initial shift to restfulness of a subject, the parameters of the proposed KF-FD model can reliably and quantifiably differentiate the stages of rest."

    "abstract": "Optimal routing is a fundamental challenge in quantum networking, with several approaches proposed to identify the most efficient path for end-to-end (e2e) entanglement generation between pairs of nodes. In this paper, we show that prior entanglements - entanglements generated in a previous network cycle but not yet utilized - are an important consideration in optimal path selection due to the dynamic nature of quantum networks. Specifically, we investigate whether a longer path with pre-existing entanglements can outperform a shorter path that starts from scratch. We account for key quantum constraints, including noisy entanglement generation and swapping, fidelity decay, probabilistic operations, and link discarding upon swap failure. Simulations reveal that longer paths with prior entanglements can establish e2e entanglement faster than shorter paths under certain conditions. We further introduce the notion of entanglement diversity, where multiple paths can be used to improve performance - either by selecting the first successful path to minimize time or using both paths to enhance fidelity through distillation. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating prior entanglements into path selection strategies for optimizing quantum communication networks."

    "abstract": "The liver tumour is one of the prelevant cancers in the world. Computed Tomography (CT) images are essential for the automatic detection of liver tumors. It serves as a useful substitute for time-consuming manual procedures and guarantees the presentation of precise and trustworthy clinical evaluation. However, a major obstacle in segmenting liver tumours is their intrinsic disparity, which is further complicated by the hazy boundaries in imaging features. The medical diagnosis of liver cancer depends on the precise segmentation of liver tumours, which could help doctors in choosing the most appropriate action while assessing the success of the operation. However, the high sensitivity and low precision of deep learning make diagnosis more difficult because of higher false-positive rates. The inability of detection algorithms to properly comprehend the anatomy from a broader viewpoint leads to the incorrect identification of lesions, resulting in false positives. Therefore, it is necessary to address the variety of issues like high-intensity levels raised by the standard liver tumour diagnosis paradigm. Hence, an efficient deep learning–based liver tumor diagnosis framework is implemented in this work. Firstly, necessary images required for the observation are collected from the standard database. subsequently, Transformer-Cascaded Unet++ (T-CasUNet++) is used for performing segmentation in the collected images. This helps in extracting essential long-range dependencies in the images, enabling it to accomplish superior segmentation accuracy, especially for slight structures and unreliable object shapes in clinical images. Once, the images are segmented, they it is subjected to the lung tumour diagnosis phase. In this phase, Generative Adversarial Network with Attention Mechanism (GAN-AM) is used to execute liver tumour diagnosis by focusing on significant tumor characteristics like fine structures and texture details, which helps in better diagnosis. Finally, a liver tumour diagnosis outcome is obtained from GAN-AM. Later, multiple validations is implemented in the suggested liver tumor diagnosis model over classical methods to validate its effectualness in different validation conditions. And the outcomes disclose that the designed model gained an accuracy of 96 %, leading to rapid and improved diagnosis of liver tumours."

    "abstract": "Breast density is a significant risk factor for breast cancer, with higher fibroglandular tissue (FGT) ratios correlating to increased cancer risk. Traditional mammography has limited sensitivity in dense breasts, prompting the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a supplemental tool due to its higher sensitivity and three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities. While 3D deep learning models are often employed for breast density assessment, they are computationally expensive, requiring specialized and costly hardware. To address these challenges, this study proposes a lightweight two-dimensional (2D) hybrid deep learning model, ViT-ResNet, for efficient breast density classification using MRI, with improved performance. The proposed model combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which excel at extracting local features, with vision transformers (ViTs), which capture global contextual information, achieving a balance of computational efficiency and robust performance. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 654 MRI scans, using the 40th, 50th, and 60th percentile slices to represent diagnostically relevant regions. It achieved an average accuracy of $81.7 \\%$ across ten iterations, with precision, recall, F1 score, and Cohen’s kappa of $86.1 \\%, 78.3 \\%, 80.8 \\%$, and 0.738, respectively. In the iteration with the highest accuracy, the model achieved an accuracy of $84.8 \\%$, a precision of $89.2 \\%$, a recall of $81.5 \\%$, an $F 1$ score of $84.1 \\%$, and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.784. Compared to prior studies utilizing 3D approaches that required multiple GPUs, this work demonstrates improved performance and computational efficiency, achieving effective results with a single GPU and showcasing the potential of a 2D strategy for breast density classification using MRI."

    "abstract": "Generating realistic map images from satellite imagery is a challenging task in computer vision. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages an attention-based U-Net architecture within a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework. Spatial and channel-wise attention blocks are integrated within a U-Net architecture to selectively focus the network on translating geospatially salient features. Extensive experiments on the Pix2Pix dataset of satellite and map image pairs demonstrate that our attention-enhanced cGAN model synthesizes maps that are more accurate and realistic than baseline cGAN approaches. Quantitative results show that our model achieves a PSNR of more than 2 dB and a 0.05 higher SSIM compared to cGAN. Furthermore, the FID score is reduced by 15% over the baseline, indicating the enhanced realism of the generated maps. This work provides both quantitative and qualitative results which highlight the merits of using attention to guide the image translation process."

    "abstract": "As engineering education continues to grow, integrating emerging technologies into the learning process is paramount to meet the demands of modern industries. This paper developed an Educational Cyber-Physical System (ECPS) designed to link the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in future engineering education. The proposed system supports a wide range of engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, civil, and computer engineering, allowing for multidisciplinary applications. By combining artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and the internet of things (IoT), students can investigate different engineering systems in a dynamic yet regulated setting. The ECPS framework enables real-time feedback, personalized learning paths, and collaborative problem-solving, fostering a deeper connection between theory and practice. The proposed work is that an AI-powered computer assistant will automatically oversee every step of the student education process, enabling prompt modifications in response to the student's development. The assistant's capacity to gather thorough data on every student activity within the programme is essential to this procedure, especially when it comes to monitoring pedagogical actions in real-time and making any necessary adjustments. This makes efficient use of ECPS to accumulate all pertinent records and extract pertinent information. This article looks at a particular instance of real-world work where students from two different places work together in a combined learning setting."

We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates distributional value estimation with continuous control under formal safety constraints. By incorporating Implicit Quantile Networks into an actor-critic architecture, our method captures uncertainty over return distributions while generating stochastic policies in continuous spaces. Safety is enforced through differentiable control barrier functions embedded into the critic's objective, and multiobjective training stability is achieved via conflict-averse gradient descent. Experiments in simulated marine scenarios demonstrate improved safety compliance and competitive performance relative to baseline methods, offering a generalizable paradigm for riskaware decision-making in real-time navigation systems."

    "abstract": "The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy. The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by aligning all the “sharp” wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii) magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%. Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.3° in a real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications."

    "abstract": "Students currently enrolled in higher education programs in this technological era need a learning framework that boosts their motivation and promotes creative thinking, allowing them to develop disciplinary and interdisciplinary competencies throughout their courses. For Computer Science students, cultivating problem-solving competency is essential through enhancing mathematical and algorithmic thinking rather than merely learning a programming language. The most effective way to acquire this competency is through practice. Computer Science students should be motivated by a learning strategy that enhances their potential and encourages active engagement in the learning process through appropriate activities. Gamification involves integrating game design elements and principles into non-game environments to boost user engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. By incorporating game-like features into students' activities, gamification seeks to transform tasks into enjoyable and rewarding experiences. Active learning is an instructional approach that actively involves students in their educational journey. Instead of passively absorbing information, students are encouraged to engage directly with the material. This method fosters collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, empowering learners to take charge of their education. Generative AI functions as an intelligent tutor, enhancing courses by enabling students to consult and support one another in their learning journey. This collaborative approach fosters a more interactive and enriching educational experience. Competitive programming empowers students to tackle problem-solving challenges using advanced programming algorithms, all within a motivating environment. During competitions, participants encounter real-world problems that enable them to apply their learning in a practical setting. This experience reinforces their existing knowledge and encourages them to explore deeper solutions as they strive to solve problems as effectively as possible. The integration of these approaches offers students a dynamic, well-rounded learning experience. It equips them with essential tools to thrive in academic and professional environments, ensuring long-term success. This study aims to evaluate the learning outcomes of integrating active learning, gamification, generative AI, and competitive programming as a cohesive approach to developing computer science students' skills."

Our method systematically separates compression into three modular stages: Entropy coding, event prediction, and adaptive event filtering. Both entropy coding and event prediction are lossless, ensuring exact signal reconstruction, while controlled, application-adaptive filtering introduces targeted lossiness only when necessary. A dynamic backpressure mechanism adjusts the filtering based on real-time bandwidth constraints, event stream complexity or application feedback. We demonstrate a prototypical software implementation, proving the framework's effectiveness on a publicly available event dataset, achieving lossless compression ratios exceeding <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 \\times$</tex> with minimal latency and complexity.

The device integrates two core modules: real-time obstacle detection and emergency response. In the first module, ultrasonic sensors detect obstructions within a 5–35 cm range, with an ATmega328 microcontroller activating a buzzer for immediate alerts. Additional awareness is provided through a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) that monitors ambient brightness and a moisture sensor that detects slippery surfaces, while an RF transmitter–receiver pair aids in locating misplaced sticks. The second module, developed using an ESP32 microcontroller, enables rapid emergency communication by combining a GPS unit, a push button for manual activation, and a MAX30102 heart rate sensor for continuous BPM monitoring. Each device is uniquely registered and transmits real-time BPM and GPS coordinates to a remote server, which relays critical information to caregivers and hospitals when required. Experimental results confirm reliable obstacle detection, effective environmental sensing, and robust emergency data transmission. By integrating embedded sensing, IoT-based communication, and health monitoring, the proposed system delivers a cost-effective assistive solution and provides a foundation for future advancements in intelligent mobility aids."

However, quantum computers will be able to break RSA encryption and make these messages readable once again. This creates a personal connection to quantum computing and its progress, as users are led to imagine a future when their messages can finally be accessed.

    "abstract": "The increasing diversity and availability of electric vehicles (EVs) have made the decision-making process for prospective buyers more complex. Conventional recommendation systems often rely on numerical ratings or structured data, failing to leverage the full context of user-generated reviews. Existing systems struggle to understand the underlying sentiment, intent, and opinion nuances expressed in natural language feedback. Additionally, static content-based or collaborative filtering models are limited in the ability to capture dynamic and contextual features from unstructured textual data. These limitations result in suboptimal recommendations and reduce the relevance of suggestions provided to end-users. To address these challenges, this work presents a sentiment-aware EV recommendation framework that leverages a BERT-based transformer model to extract deep contextual representations from user reviews. The system processes unstructured text to classify sentiment and integrates this output with a recommendation module for generating personalized EV suggestions. The methodology combines textual understanding with preference mapping, thereby improving recommendation precision. Preprocessing techniques ensure clean and normalized input, while the architecture is optimized through fine-tuning of transformer layers and application of dropout for generalization. Key features of this work include the use of pre-trained deep language models for sentiment mining, integration of review-level sentiment into recommendation logic, and application of robust evaluation metrics such as F1-score and RMSE. The proposed system provides meaningful and relevant EV suggestions that reflect user sentiments and real-world experiences."

Sorting trash into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories requires a lot of time and effort; otherwise, errors occur frequently when done manually. This research paper provides a hybrid deep learning system which combines Modified LinkNet and Enhanced SegNet and a transfer learning approach to achieve the goal of automated waste classification using high accuracy. The improved SegNet has the ability to clearly differentiate garbage objects on complex backgrounds, unlike the modified LinkNet that uses EfficientNet/MobileNet transfer learning techniques to classify objects. A trained and tested model was trained using over 2,500 labelled images consisting of the TrashNet and TACO datasets. The data was supplemented to strengthen it. Based on the experiment findings, this model is 98 per cent accurate, 97 per cent precise, 96 per cent recall, and 98 per cent specific, which is greater compared to the standard CNN, VGG-16, and ResNet-50 architectures. The analysis conducted by ROC indicated that the AUC equals 0.98, and it is a good indicator that the model is very well able to distinguish between various types of data. The training-validation curves indicated that overfitting was not taking place too much. Being able to leverage the advanced method in relation to smart waste systems that can make the use of rubbish sorting scalable, sustainable, and efficient in real time is a promising idea. The future research will be done on the improvement of categorizing different types of waste and real-time usage optimization on edge devices."

    "abstract": "The evolution of manufacturing toward Smart Factories has highlighted critical challenges in equipment maintenance, particularly the reliance on numerous contact sensors for anomaly detection, resulting in escalating sensor and computational costs. This study investigates the application of quantum kernels to enhance anomaly detection using non-contact sensors. We hypothesized that quantum computing's expressive power could effectively discriminate among multiple anomaly types using fewer sensors. Our experimental setup involved detecting and classifying anomalies from two distinct manufacturing equipment: a conveyor and a chain belt machine using a single directional microphone positioned at varying distances (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0-3 ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>). Audio data was processed through Autoregressive (AR) models to extract coefficient features, which were then mapped into quantum feature space using quantum kernels for one-class SVM classification. Results demonstrated that quantum kernel implementations maintained near-perfect accuracy and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F} 1$</tex>-scores (consistently <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{&gt; 0. 9 2}$</tex>) across all distances, while classical approaches showed significant performance degradation beyond the 0 m position. Feature space visualization revealed that quantum kernels effectively separated different anomaly types into distinct quadrants within a two-dimensional representation, enabling not only detection but also classification of multiple equipment failures. Specifically, under the third and fourth features space, conveyor anomalies consistently appeared in the second quadrant, while chain belt anomalies clustered in the fourth quadrant. This study demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enable significant anomaly detection in noisy factory environments using fewer non-contact sensors, representing an important step toward realizing quantum-enhanced smart factories with reduced infrastructure requirements and improved maintenance efficiency."

    "abstract": "Heart dysfunction can be very dangerous and directly associated with the risk of fatality. Therefore, automatic heart rate monitoring is important for detecting a heart abnormality early and providing timely intervention. The development of advanced sensor technology allows continuous tracking of the heart rate, as well as providing more health-related data sources, which could further improve the forecasting performance. In this study, we investigate the use of recent heart rate values and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) data in the last 20s to predict the next 10s of heart rate. Data were collected from 20 participants performing different activities. We examine the forecasting by using only a heart rate sensor (uni-modality) and by using heart rate sensor and UWB together (multi-modality). Three levels of activity were included in the study: resting (rest), lying after doing exercises (lying-abnormal) and lying after full recovery (lying-normal). A multi-modality Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model has a 10-percent quantile losses of 5.20 for rest activity, 4.92 for lying-abnormal activity, and 4.24 for lying-normal activity. With the lowest loss, Seq2Seq outperforms Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Error Trend and Seasonality (ETS), Transformer and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) in forecasting heart rate in the three activity levels. Our results point to a new direction in multimodal prediction of heart rate to assist healthcare, using deep learning approaches."

    "abstract": "During failure analysis, probing the inner circuit is a method used for fault localization. There exists a passivation layer above the metal trace, which blocks the probe needle from landing on the metal trace. Passivation removal is a key process before performing the probe analysis. Common methods include using a Reactive Ion Etcher (RIE) or a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) to expose the metal trace and make Pt deposition. Using RIE will etch the entire passivation layer on the die surface, making further circuit edits inconvenient. Using FIB will result in longer analysis times. To address this, green/UV laser could be a better way to remove passivation in certain areas. Using a laser could reduce the analysis time and allow for localized circuit edits. This paper will discuss how to remove passivation using green/UV laser and the benefits compared to other methods."

Our approach decomposes the target graph into a set of matchings, where a matching is a collection of disjoint edges that can be implemented exactly using multi-controlled rotation gates. The overall CTQW evolution is then approximated via Trotterization over these matchings. We validate our approach through comprehensive comparison with Pauli decomposition methods across all connected isomorphic 8-vertex graphs, demonstrating comparable accuracy across all test cases. Our matching decomposition achieves reduced gate counts compared to Pauli decomposition for approximately 33% of all connected 8-vertex graphs, with particular advantages for graphs that decompose into small numbers of matchings or contain many disjoint edges. Our matching decomposition provides a valuable alternative pathway for implementing CTQW-based algorithms on near-term gate-based quantum devices while maintaining the fundamental quantum advantages of walk-based computation."

Traditional testing techniques, while effective in controlled settings, often fall short in capturing the dynamic behavior that lead to latent faults in real-world deployments. This paper presents Tricorder, a novel software reliability approach for failure forecasting, based on continuous observation of resource utilization during software execution. Tricorder collects resource usage profiles and analyzes them by applying unsupervised clustering based on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD), which groups data sets, allowing for highlighting anomalous behaviors. The approach is fully black-box, generalizable across platforms, and applicable to distinct domains. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach can forecast failures by identifying hidden faults under diverse runtime conditions, supporting automated, low-overhead reliability monitoring during post-deployment and maintenance activity."

To address low-cost remote and automatic irrigation practices, we present GreenSphere, an automatic plant watering system that incorporates Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML) to make irrigation decisions in real-time. Utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, GreenSphere deployed sensor readings of the environmental conditions, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light, and water levels. A Random Forest model was trained, producing a 99.8% accuracy rating for optimal irrigation time, while periodic rule-based decisions received. In regard to pump operation, tests showed the accuracy of timing was within ±3%, and that the pump was consuming nominal energy. With respect to farmer adoption, GreenSphere demonstrated feasible use in small-scale farms, urban gardening, and as an educational platform for students. The sustainability attributes of GreenSphere provide low-cost, modular, and sustainable attributes to contribute towards more efficient resource use and help to align with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals."

In phase two, a causal graphical model organizes multiple pretrained Transformers to capture inter-metric dependencies and propagate adjustment effects.

    "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer that spreads quickly. When it first appears, it typically presents as small facial lesions that are easily overlooked or may even seem like harmless patches of skin. Many cases are not detected until they reach more advanced stages, which is why dermatological care is often overlooked and can be difficult to cure. This research presents a simple, web-based system that can detect facial melanoma in real-time using standard photos captured by smartphones and webcams. The technology is lightweight and user-friendly. It uses the precision-detecting You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) system to identify moles and also has a compact Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) that classifies each mole as either benign or malignant. This system's success is due to its ability to handle everyday, non-clinical photos, unlike many other systems that rely on clinic-based dermoscopic images. Using 1,500 labeled images of facial moles, the tests achieved an accuracy of 99.3%, with precision and recall scores that exceeded 93%. Mobile devices can display the model at roughly 25 frames per second, making it a viable option for screening in real-time. Moreover, the site provides information on warning signs of melanoma to boost awareness and promote early medical consultation. With its exceptional accuracy, speed, and accessibility, it offers a useful way to detect early stages of melanoma well before clinical trials, far beyond the typical open clinic setting."

However, conventional AI-based dermatological systems depend on centralized image storage, raising serious concerns over data security, patient privacy, and compliance with regulations such as GDPR. This work presents a privacy-focused diagnostic framework leveraging federated deep learning on mobile devices, enabling local training of lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically MobileNetV3, without transferring raw images to a central server. Privacy is further reinforced through the integration of differential privacy and secure aggregation, ensuring that sensitive health data remains confined to user devices. The HAM10000 dataset, containing over 10,000 dermatoscopic images, is partitioned under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) conditions to simulate real-world variability. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 87.2%, F1-score of 0.85, and AUC of 0.91, while reducing communication bandwidth by approximately 35% compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the feasibility of delivering secure, accurate, and communication-efficient dermatological diagnosis on smartphones. The proposed federated learning paradigm offers a scalable and regulation-compliant mobile health (mHealth) solution, paving the way for equitable access to dermatological care, especially in resource-limited or remote settings."

The study aims to address this gap by conducting a comparative analysis between the Durban University of Technology (DUT) in South Africa and the University of Ibadan (UI) in Nigeria. This analysis aims to enhance ethics governance and deliberative strategies for experimental engineering research. The comparative analysis will provide valuable insights for improving ethical practices and decision-making processes in both institutions. The study employs a qualitative methodology based on ethics committee reports, faculty interviews, and curriculum audits from both institutions. Findings reveal that ethical risk is often overlooked in experimental work involving engineered materials, prototype testing, energy systems, and environmental interventions. The absence of formal ethical review for such research not only exposes institutions to reputational risk but also limits the development of ethically conscious engineers."

    "abstract": "The effective management of the vast amounts of data processed or required by modern cloud and edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This paper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be stored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional data layer enhances the “quality” of the object’s version, albeit at the cost of increased memory usage. This layered approach is advantageous in various scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding, future virtual reality gaming, and layered neural network models, where additional data layers improve quality/inference accuracy. In systems where users or devices request different versions of a data object, layered representations provide the flexibility needed for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates, i.e., delivering the specific representations required by users. This paper investigates the performance of the Least Recently Used (LRU) caching policy in the context of layered representation for data, referred to as Layered LRU (LLRU). To this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for LLRU. We analyze how LLRU’s performance is influenced by factors such as the number of layers, as well as the popularity and size of an object’s layers. For example, our results demonstrate that, in the case of LLRU, adding more layers does not always enhance performance. Instead, the effectiveness of LLRU depends intricately on the popularity distribution and size characteristics of the layers."

We first show that determining lower/upper bound communication complexity is closely related to the number of machines whose qubit capacity becomes full at different stages of QFT. Subsequently, we provide lower and upper bounds on the number of full machines during the execution of distributed QFT. These bounds help us determine the lower bound of the number of nonlocal operations that should be performed during distribution of QFT on clique networks. We initially analyze the lower bound on communication complexity for the case where machines have capacity two; i.e., each quantum machine can hold at most two qubits. We show that, in this case, the lower bound is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Omega\\left(n^{2}\\right)$</tex>, where <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n$</tex> denotes the number of input qubits. Considering the existing quadratic upper bound in related work, our lower bound result implies that the existing upper bound is actually tight when machine capacity is two. This is a significant theoretical boundary for developers of distribution compilers. We also show that if machine capacity <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$c&gt;2$</tex> is a fixed fraction of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n$</tex>, then the lower bound becomes linear."

    "abstract": "Student-Centered Learning (SCL) approaches have significantly enhanced educational outcomes. In engineering undergraduate programs within Washington Accord member countries, incorporating SCL methodologies into Teaching and Learning is mandatory to meet accreditation standards and achieve course learning outcomes. However, implementing SCL in engineering curricula presents notable challenges, particularly for educators accustomed to traditional lecture-based teaching who lack the necessary knowledge, skills, and pedagogical beliefs. This study, part of a broader effort to improve engineering education in Indonesia, investigates the effects of two online active learning workshops featuring 116 engineering educators from two universities in Central Java, conducted over three half-day sessions. The workshop design drew on Needham's Constructivist instructional model, including interactive, thought-provoking activities and practical sessions. Participants documented their learning experiences in online journals, which were thematically analyzed. Four main themes emerged regarding the effectiveness of the workshop: learning content, instructional design, facilitation support, and engagement experience. The participants' shift toward SCL, as evaluated using Mezirow's Transformative Learning Theory, indicated that they had reached the first six of ten transformative learning phases. The findings suggest that the workshops effectively promoted the adoption of SCL and enhanced participants' knowledge and confidence in applying active learning strategies in their classrooms."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed for real-time perception tasks such as surveillance and tracking. However, the captured images often suffer from motion blur due to platform instability and high-speed movement, significantly degrading the performance of downstream vision algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight and effective deblur-detect pipeline for UAV scenarios. Specifically, we enhance the MIMO-UNet deblurring backbone by replacing its Shallow Convolutional Module (SCM) with a Ghost module-inspired GhostSCM block, improving feature representation efficiency while reducing model complexity. The modified deblurring model is followed by YOLO11n for object detection. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on a motion-blurred version of the VisDrone dataset under varying blur intensities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality deblurring performance, achieving excellent PSNR and SSIM scores across various blur levels. Moreover, our deblur-detect pipeline yields the highest detection accuracy with minimal computational overhead, achieving a favorable balance between accuracy and speed. These results highlight the potential of lightweight deblurring modules to improve robustness in UAV vision systems operating under real-world motion degradation."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Despite recent developments in image steganography, many steganography techniques continue to rely heavily on bit manipulation or deep learning models alongside cover images, making them vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as steganalysis and noise-induced distortions. These methods often suffer from robustness limitations because slight modifications to the cover images—such as compression, scaling, or noise addition—can easily corrupt the hidden message. Additionally, these techniques generally require high computational resources due to the complexity of deep learning models, making them less practical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. In the proposed approach, a fixed definition model and new open-source tools of stable diffusion, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient model adaptation and ControlNet for structural guidance, are used to ensure greater control over image generation while maintaining high fidelity to the hidden data. These technologies provide additional control and diversity in container image production, which improves the overall system. Recent advances have used text prompts as keys in Coverless Image Steganography (CIS) via diffusion models; nevertheless, this technique has drawbacks, such as vulnerability when private prompts are guessed, difficulty in supplying semantically different public prompts, and the possibility of prompt leakage during transmission. This paradigm solves the key drawbacks of existing cover-based techniques, resulting in considerable improvements in security, robustness, and control, all without requiring model retraining."

    "abstract": "Solving problems related to planning and operations of large-scale power systems is challenging on classical computers due to their inherent nature as mixed-integer and nonlinear problems. Quantum computing provides new avenues to approach these problems. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the Unit Commitment (UC) problem in power systems which aims at minimizing the total cost while optimally allocating generating units to meet the hourly demand of the power loads. The hybrid algorithm combines a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with a classical Benders-type heuristic. The resulting algorithm computes approximate solutions to UC in three stages: i) a collection of UC vectors capable meeting the power demand with lowest possible operating costs is generated based on VQA; ii) a classical sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) routine is leveraged to find the optimal power level corresponding to a predetermined number of candidate vectors; iii) in the last stage, the approximate solution of UC along with generating units power level combination is given. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method, three different systems with 3 generating units, 10 generating units, and 26 generating units were tested for different time periods. In addition, convergence of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for select time periods is proven out on IonQ's Forte system."

While LEO satellites offer inherent resilience against physical attacks, their reliance on wireless backhaul links and centralized network infrastructure introduces vulnerabilities to disruptions, particularly during targeted attacks or infrastructure failures. To address this, we propose 6G-DTAuth (6G Distributed Tokenbased Authentication), a distributed authentication framework that enables secure and reliable User Equipment (UE) communication even in the absence of the serving network (SN), home network (HN), or centralized control. 6G-DTAuth encapsulates UE-related context in a secure token generated during standard authentication with the HN. This token allows decentralized reauthentication and context recovery at the SN and base station (BS) during network disruptions. We implement and evaluate 6G-DTAuth using UERANSIM and free5GC, demonstrating its effectiveness, minimal overhead, and strong security properties. Our result shows that 6G-DTAuth can maintain service continuity and defend against MITM, replay, DoS, and token manipulation attacks, offering a practical path toward resilient 6G satelliteintegrated networks."

This study investigates the impact of cross-cultural collaboration on student learning outcomes in joint capstone design projects comprising students from two universities: one based in Canada and the other in China. The research focuses on how in-person team bonding activities enhance collaboration effectiveness and project performance. Students worked in mixed teams to complete real-world engineering design challenges (in the areas of robotics, automation, and thermo-fluids among other), involving concept development, engineering analysis, prototyping, and presentations. While most collaboration occurred virtually through digital platforms, students from the Canadian university traveled to visit students in the Chinese university during the Fall semester for face-to-face interaction with teammates and mentors. Similarly, Chinese students traveled to Canada at the end of the Winter term. Surveys and performance metrics were collected before and after the in-person visit to assess changes in collaboration quality and learning experience. Results indicate that virtual-only interactions, though convenient, limit rapport and communication depth. In contrast, in-person engagement significantly improved team cohesion, reduced communication-related anxiety, and enhanced participation. Notably, student team academic performance as measured by progress presentation scores improved relative to the class average following the in-person visit. The findings offer practical insights for global engineering educators, demonstrating the value of blending virtual tools with in-person experiences to enhance teamwork and project outcomes."

Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers the potential for a quadratic speedup over classical methods used to estimate metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, numerous limitations remain in efficiently scaling the implementation of quantum circuits that solve these estimation problems. One of the main challenges is the use of costly and restrictive arithmetic that must be implemented within the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose using Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) to significantly reduce the cost of implementing the state preparation operator, which underlies QAE for credit risk analysis. We also present an end-to-end code implementation and the results of a simulation study to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its benefits."

This project aims to combine discourse semantics and student interaction behavior in developing a strong dual-modality system to reliably infer cognitive presence. The proposed method employs a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to simulate sequential patterns of behavior that are learned from discrete clickstream data. The Community of Inquiry model categorizes asynchronous forum discussion into cognitive presence stages by applying a BERT-based transformer model. To output an overall, time-varying cognitive presence profile, a Bayesian fusion method combines the probability of semantic classes with stages of behavior across time. To confirm the experiment, a Massive open online course (MOOC) was adopted, which contained over 1.2 million click activities and 15,000 message in the forum. The approach outperforms both baseline and unimodal methods, obtaining a macro-F1 measure of 96.2% and a stable correlation with academic performance (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.81).

Several problems in machine learning, including dynamic pricing and dynamic model pruning are conceptualized as pure-exploration dynamic assignment problems constrained by budgets. Given a high-dimensional action space and exploration budget, CluE operates by first discretizing the action space into a manageable set of discrete actions and then clustering these actions. The algorithm proceeds in phases, selectively sampling from the most promising cluster and refining choices to the optimal action within that cluster. Suboptimal clusters are eliminated at the end of each phase based on confidence bounds estimates. We have conducted extensive testing in federated learning and logistics, demonstrating that CluE substantially lowers the misidentification probability compared to leading elimination-based algorithms in pure-exploration settings."

This approach employs a dual-mode optimization of unit cache optimality and unit energy optimality to refine the paging structure subject to fine-tuning, freeze a fraction of weights at a fine granularity, and devises an adaptive pipeline parallel method tailored to the big.LITTLE architecture of edge devices. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively and stably updates weights within the end-side hardware under limited memory and power supply conditions, thus presenting a viable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large models on edge devices with a video memory of merely 4 GB or less."

Principal Component Analysis and SHAP-based feature ranking were applied to produce subsets of 30, 20, 15, 10, 5, and 3 features from the original 41. For each subset, models were optimized using Optuna and evaluated on training time, prediction latency, accuracy, and weighted F1 score. Results indicate that XGBoost sustains the greatest robustness under aggressive reduction: an F1 of 0.9962 with all features and 0.9700 with only three features, while achieving approximately a 70 percent reduction in training time at extreme reduction levels. Decision Tree exhibited the lowest inference latency but experienced larger performance loss below ten features. Random Forest maintained competitive F1 values but incurred substantially higher training overhead at moderate to high dimensions. These findings provide guidance for deploying intrusion-detection models in resource-constrained settings, highlighting trade-offs between detection fidelity and computational burden and informing choices for real-time monitoring applications."

A model predictive control strategy is then designed based on this linear predictor. The Koopman-based framework enables eigenvalue analysis of the lifted state matrix, providing deeper insights into system behavior. Simulation results show that the proposed controller achieves effective regulation compared to a nonlinear controller, while reducing computational effort."

To address this limitation, this paper proposes a high-precision inverse design model, MMFR-Net. By integrating image data and numerical data, the model leverages a cross-modal attention mechanism and gated multimodal units to achieve effective information fusion, thereby significantly reducing errors. Experimental results demonstrate that MMFR-Net outperforms conventional methods in prediction accuracy, with the average error controlled below 5%. Four sets of simulation validations further confirm the model' s effectiveness and physical feasibility. In conclusion, MMFR-Net markedly improves the precision of metamaterial inverse design through multimodal fusion, providing an efficient and accurate modeling approach for the intelligent design of metamaterials."

    "abstract": "Portfolio optimization is one of the most studied optimization problems at the intersection of quantum computing and finance. In this work, we develop the first quantum formulation for a portfolio optimization problem with higherorder moments, skewness and kurtosis. Including higher-order moments leads to more detailed modeling of portfolio return distributions. Portfolio optimization with higher-order moments has been studied in classical portfolio optimization approaches but with limited exploration within quantum formulations. In the context of quantum optimization, higher-order moments generate higher-order terms in the cost Hamiltonian. Thus, instead of obtaining a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, we obtain a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which has a natural formulation as a parametrized circuit. Additionally, we employ realistic integer variable encoding and a capital-based budget constraint. We consider the classical continuous variable solution with integer programming-based discretization to be the computationally efficient classical baseline for the problem. Our extensive experimental evaluation of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0}$</tex> portfolio optimization problems shows that the solutions to the HUBO formulation often correspond to better portfolio allocations than the classical baseline. This is a promising result for those who want to perform computationally challenging portfolio optimization on quantum hardware, as portfolio optimization with higher moments is classically complex. Moreover, the experimental evaluation studies QAOA's performance with higher-order terms in this practically relevant problem."

    "abstract": "Integrating neural rendering with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has shown great promise for achieving high-precision localization and photorealistic scene reconstruction. However, the dynamic perspectives of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), compounded by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal interference and the accumulation of localization errors, pose significant challenges to existing monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods in complex environments. To address these limitations, we propose LD3DGS-SLAM, a novel framework that integrates monocular SLAM, GNSS, and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) [1] to enhance UAV-based localization and mapping. The system integrates traditional geometric feature-based localization with the multiview synthesis capability of 3D Gaussian rendering, achieving a breakthrough in accuracy while enhancing robustness. First, we construct a multisensor fusion graph optimization model that tightly integrates GNSS and monocular vision data, effectively mitigating the cumulative drift typical of traditional SLAM pipelines. Afterward, we introduce a 3D Gaussian-based mapping strategy that incrementally refines a dense scene representation using SLAM-generated point clouds, fusing geometric and texture information to reconstruct highly accurate and detailed maps. To further enhance localization performance in GNSS-denied scenarios, we develop a dynamic frame interpolation and tracking approach based on 3D Gaussian rendering. By synthesizing novel viewpoints, this method improves observation matching and strengthens loop closure detection, enabling robust relocalization in large-scale environments. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we implement a UAV test system and evaluate its performance on both the publicly available TUM [2] dataset and a self-collected aerial dataset spanning several kilometers. Experimental results show that LD3DGS-SLAM achieves a state-of-the-art average localization error of only 0.8 meters using just a monocular camera, even during long-range flight missions exceeding tens of kilometers and altitudes up to 500 meters. Overall, LD3DGS-SLAM effectively addresses the limitations of monocular SLAM in aerial scenarios, providing a robust, accurate, and cost-effective localization solution for urban air mobility and aerial Internet of Things (IoT) applications."

    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are gaining attention as versatile models for quantum machine learning, but training them effectively remains a challenge. Most existing approaches, such as quantum multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), use fidelity-based cost functions. While well-suited for pure states, these measures are less reliable when inputs and outputs are mixed states—a situation common in learning quantum channels. In this work, we introduce a training framework built on a relative entropyinspired cost function. By quantifying the directional divergence between learned and target states, relative entropy provides a more informative and principled measure than linear fidelity, naturally capturing both spectral and eigenvector differences in mixed states. This approach preserves the completely positive (CP) structure of the network, supports efficient back-propagation in layered QNN configurations, and achieves improved accuracy and convergence over fidelity-based training. These results highlight entropy-based optimization as a promising path toward scalable, robust, and noise-resilient quantum learning."

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of the Internet of Drones (IoD) in sectors such as logistics, power, and agriculture, its impact is steadily extending to economic, social, and technological domains, thereby accelerating the development of the low-altitude economy and low-altitude networking. However, in these application scenarios, a large volume of sensitive data must be transmitted over open or insecure wireless channels, exposing IoD to severe security and privacy threats, including key leakage, identity forgery, and physical tampering attacks. Moreover, the inherent limitations of drones in terms of computational and communication resources render conventional security mechanisms based on computationally expensive public-key cryptography impractical for low-altitude networking environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and efficient intra/inter-domain authentication scheme tailored for low-altitude networks. The proposed scheme integrates fractional-order Chebyshev chaotic maps, physically unclonable functions with error-correcting code, and hash functions to achieve mutual authentication and session key establishment within a domain. Furthermore, a proxy-based credential conversion mechanism is introduced to enhance inter-domain authentication efficiency while significantly reducing the storage burden on drones. Security analysis demonstrates that the scheme can withstand various common attacks, while performance evaluation further validates its advantages in reducing computational and communication overhead."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an optimized spoke-type interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor featuring a flux-concentrating rotor, which can be used to reduce leakage magnetic flux and increase efficiency. The output torque is increased by improved PM utilization ratio. Then, an improved Taguchi iterative optimization method coupled with finite element analysis (FEA) is applied to optimize structural parameters by rationally narrowing the range of variables. Compared to the initial spoke-type and U-type motors, the optimal flux-concentrating motor can obtain higher airgap flux-density in main flux path without additional magnet material usage. This is made possible by elevation of working point of the PMs and reduction of the PM leakage magnetic flux. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of the optimal motor, including open-circuit characteristics, load characteristics, temperature distribution, and mechanical integrity, has been carried out to validate the rationality of the optimal scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme can increase the output torque by up to 25% and the efficiency by 1% with a fairly small raise in torque ripple. Finally, two 3000r/min 10 kW prototypes are fabricated to validate the superiority of the proposed design."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly adopted in IoT systems for tasks such as resource allocation and control. However, in privacy-critical and resource-constrained environments, existing privacy-preserving RL schemes suffer from high computational cost, slow convergence, and limited scalability due to the use of homomorphic encryption or differential privacy. We propose a distributed privacy-preserving Q-learning framework that enables secure and efficient policy updates across multiple clients. Each client independently trains a local Q-table and encrypts it using a sparse matrix transformation combined with additive secret sharing of structured perturbations. The encrypted Q-tables are uploaded to a cloud server for aggregation and averaging without decryption. The encrypted global Q-table is then returned and decrypted locally using the inverse sparse matrix. Experimental results on four benchmark environments (CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, and LunarLander-v3) show that our scheme achieves up to 92% reduction in computation time compared to the FHE-based method, while maintaining comparable reward performance and faster convergence."

    "abstract": "An important family of codes for data storage systems, cryptography, consumer electronics, and network coding for error control in digital communications are the so-called cyclic codes. This kind of linear codes are also important due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Because of this, cyclic codes have been studied for many years, however their complete weight distributions are known only for a few cases. The complete weight distribution has a wide range of applications in many research fields as the information it contains is of vital use in practical applications. Unfortunately, obtaining these distributions is in general a very hard problem that normally involves the evaluation of sophisticated exponential sums, which leaves this problem open for most of the cyclic codes. In this paper we determine, for any finite field IF<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sub>q</sub></i>, the explicit factorization of any polynomial of the form <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>q</i>+1</sup>-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</i>, where <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</i> ∈ IF<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sub>q</sub></i>*. Then we use this result to obtain, without the need to evaluate any kind of exponential sum, the complete weight distributions of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two over any finite field. As an application of our findings, we employ the complete weight distributions of some irreducible cyclic codes presented here to construct systematic authentication codes, showing that they are optimal or almost optimal."

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations provide intuitive insights into AI model decisions by showing minimal changes needed to alter predictions. However, generating plausible counterfactuals for multivariate time series remains challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, inter-channel correlations, and the need to preserve physiologically realistic patterns, particularly in safety-critical domains like healthcare. This paper presents a novel framework for generating plausible counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classification, demonstrated on 12-lead ECG data. Our approach employs a hierarchical perturbation strategy guided by permutation-based feature importance, operating at both segment and channel levels to handle temporal dependencies and channel correlations inherent in time series. By anchoring counterfactuals to existing instances from the target class, we enrich plausibility while maintaining minimal modifications. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline method: 98% validity (vs. 65%), 43% reduction in required modifications, and 75% improvement in proximity to original instances. This work contributes: (I) a perturbation-based explanation approach combining instance-based and importance-guided generation for time series, (II) comprehensive evaluation metrics tailored for multivariate time series, and (III) empirical validation on medical data where interpretability is crucial for clinical adoption."

    "abstract": "With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and immense transitions to industry, it is important to regulate and establish standards for this fascinating technology. As a result, AI-powered applications need to be checked for compliance with AI regulations. Although compliance checks have been extensively discussed by the research community and industry, AI compliance checks and verification still need to be explored, and pitfalls need to be identified. This paper aims at automating the extraction of AI regulations using the knowledge graph and the ontology defined for legal documents. The paper first reports the initial effort to create knowledge graphs for legal documents (e.g., the EU AI Act) using different language models trained in general textual documents where general approaches in extracting Named-Entity Recognition (NER) are employed. Triplets in the form of <Subject-Predicate-Object> are extracted followed by enhancement achieved through augmenting NER tags by information captured using dependency parsers. The paper then presents a methodology called Co-Compliance Officer (CO2) where Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed to build knowledge graphs and NER which are solely for parsing and extracting legal documents. The LLM ontology is then used to create effective tags that are specifically designed to extract legal documents and the relationships between legal entities. The created knowledge graphs are then used to perform several verification analysis on legal documents, including inconsistency checks and violations. The results indicate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be helpful in compliance checking of legal documents, in particular, the documents created for AI compliance checking."

    "abstract": "The discovery of protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites is vital for exploring the principles of PPIs. Developing computational approaches to predict PPI sites can effectively compensate for biological experiments, which are mostly time-consuming and vulnerable-to-noise. In recent years, deep learning has been used to predict PPI sites, by considering the contextual information of target amino acid residues and using a local protein sequence to represent the targets. However, traditional deep-learning techniques, e.g., DNNs and CNNs, disregard important spatial hierarchies contained in the features of protein sequences, leading to their failure to effectively distinguish interaction sites from different residue regions. In this work, we design <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MSE-CapsPPISP</i>, a new deep-learning model to address PPI site prediction with spatial hierarchies. The key idea of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MSE-CapsPPISP</i> is to take into account the hierarchical relationships between the features of protein sequences. We characterize the hierarchical relationships by designing a tailored <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Capsule Network</i>, which is a novel type of neural network with vector neurons.

This systematic review synthesizes empirical research from 45 scholarly studies published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on the multifaceted nature of student wellbeing in engineering programs. Using the PRISMA 2020 framework, the review identifies five core dimensions of wellbeing namely, psychological, academic, emotional, social, and physical; and examines their antecedents (e.g., academic workload, institutional support), outcomes (e.g., academic performance, persistence), and mediating/moderating variables (e.g., self-efficacy, coping strategies, mindfulness, social support). Theoretical models including Self Determination theory, the Job Demands-Resources model, Conservation of Resources theory, Theory of Planned Behavior, and the Transactional Model of Stress underpin several studies, though nearly half articles lacked explicit theoretical grounding. The findings reveal critical gaps in longitudinal analysis, theoretical integration, and institutional policy assessment. A conceptual framework is proposed to guide future research and inform educational policy and practice. The review highlights the urgent need to integrate wellbeing into engineering education, aiming to support students' overall growth and academic success"

    "abstract": "Effective epidemic control is crucial for mitigating the spread of infectious diseases, particularly when pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines or treatments are limited. Nonpharmaceutical strategies, including mobility restrictions, are key in reducing transmission rates but require careful optimization to balance public health benefits and socioeconomic costs. Quantum computing is emerging as a powerful tool for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable for classical methods and can thus be leveraged to handle mobility restrictions. This article presents a new approach to optimizing epidemic control strategies using quantum computing techniques. We focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly mobility restriction, modeled as a discrete-time network epidemic process based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and sus-ceptible-infected-removed frameworks. The control problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization task, inherently NPhard due to the binary nature of intervention decisions. To tackle this computational complexity, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization representation of the control problem, enabling its efficient solution via quantum computing resources. Our methodology is validated through numerical simulations on realistic case studies, showcasing the potential of quantum algorithms for enhancing epidemic control strategies. These findings pave the way for leveraging quantum optimization in broader applications of networked dynamical systems, demonstrating its viability for complex decision-making processes in public health management."

This presents a significant barrier to entry for programmers who have not yet built up an intuition about quantum gate semantics, and it can prove to be tedious even for those who have. In this paper, we present Qwerty, a new quantum programming language that allows programmers to manipulate qubits more expressively than gates and trace programs without bra-ket notation. Due to its novel basis type and easy interoperability with Python, Qwerty is a powerful framework for high-level quantum-classical computation."

Anchoring biases forced up sales of high-priced products by $42 \\%$ - a perfect testimony of the influence of psychological cues. But this created issues of transparency and trust as potential ethical issues for commerce. Therefore, the studies bring out the need to increase the effectiveness of marketing as well as maintaining ethical practice. Specific suggestions are given on how to create relevant responsible and bias conscious campaigns and that they should avoid the misuse of psychological appeals when implementing digital marketing strategies."

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the promotion of hard and soft skills through curriculum planning for Materials Science, using the CDIO (Conceiving-Designing-Implementing-Operation Processes) as criteria. This planning has as a common denominator that engineering students, in their academic and professional training, must be able to operate authentic engineering project systems to connect what is discussed in the classroom with its connection to the specific needs of the external world. The Materials Science course plays a fundamental role in the development of new agro-industrial products for the aquaculture industry, taking the Panamanian context as a reference, for example. On the one hand, and on the other, there is a need to consider the growing focus on sustainability, so that students can research, develop, and propose new products that reduce the environmental impact of local and regional aquaculture. In this regard, this study presents the agro-industrial evaluation of mango (Mangifera indica) peels in the pellet production process for aquaculture. Pellets were used to feed Gray Tilapia (Oreocrhomis niloticus) fingerlings for over a month. It is worth noting that when discussing environmental issues in the classroom, we students were able to conduct tests and analyses, which was crucial to ensuring the safety and efficacy of the developed product. This also allowed us to assist in the optimization of production processes in the aquaculture industry, ranging from raw material selection to process design aimed at minimizing waste and maximizing efficiency. This participatory approach, which brings together the internal and external aspects of the classroom, allowed us to interact with potential project beneficiaries, as well as with other projects and research groups, such as the 2023 Ibero-American Researchers' Night organized by the Organization of Ibero-American States, where we were able to share the main findings, opportunities, and challenges with the participating community. In short, Materials Science provides a solid foundation for addressing challenges and opportunities, such as the aquaculture industry, giving students opportunity to contribute to the development of new, more efficient and sustainable agro-industrial products. Given the results obtained in the manufacturing process of this potential alternative feed for aquaculture species, and considering the maintenance of fry fed exclusively with the same feed, it is necessary to continue this project from a scalability and funding perspective."

The analysis reveals that effective ethical governance requires an integrated approach combining multiple frameworks: deontological principles establish boundaries, utilitarian considerations guide optimization within these constraints, and virtue ethics provides contextual wisdom for implementation. Through systematic evaluation across AI development, privacy protection, and platform governance, the research demonstrates that while individual frameworks offer valuable perspectives, an integrated approach better addresses complex technological challenges. This research provides practical guidelines for developing responsible AI systems and governance frameworks, emphasizing the importance of cultural sensitivity and adaptive implementation in technological ethics."

    "abstract": "Circuit cutting allows quantum circuits larger than the available hardware to be executed. Cutting techniques split circuits into smaller subcircuits, run them on the hardware, and recombine results through classical post-processing. Circuit cutting techniques have been extensively researched over the last five years and it been adopted by quantum companies, like IBM, as part of their scaling roadmap. We examine whether current circuit cutting techniques are practical for orchestrating executions on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We conduct a resource estimation-based benchmarking of important quantum applications and different types of circuit cutting techniques. Our applications include practically relevant algorithms such as Hamiltonian simulation, kernels such as quantum Fourier transform and more. To cut these applications, we use IBM's Qiskit cutting tool. We estimate resources for subcircuits using Microsoft's Azure Quantum Resource Estimator and develop models to determine qubit counts and the quantum and classical runtime needs of circuit cutting. We demonstrate that while circuit cutting works for small-scale systems, the exponential growth of the quantum excution runtime and the classical post-processing overhead as the qubit count increases renders it impractical for larger quantum systems with current implementation strategies. As we transition from noisy quantum hardware to fault-tolerance, our work provides useful guidance for the design of quantum software and runtime systems."

    "abstract": "Motorcycle or two-wheeler riders are mostly vulnerable to severe injuries during accidents as compared to four-wheeler users due to the lack of physical protection. The goal of this project is to create an integrated airbag system that will increase rider safety by quickly inflating an airbag when it detects a collision. In order to detect abrupt deceleration, skidding, or tipping, the system makes use of an MPU6050 sensor module, which continuously measures acceleration and angular velocity and also ultrasonic sensors to detect the object nearby. Sensor data is processed by the Arduino Uno microcontroller, which then compares it to the predetermined threshold. Within milliseconds of detecting a crash, the microprocessor sends a signal to a relay-controlled CO₂ inflator, which inflates the airbag and reduces impact injuries by acting as a cushion. A Li-Po battery powers the system, allowing it to function independently even when there are power outages. For powering Arduino we use a power adapter. The main objective of this project is to achieve a minimum severity during an accident of a two-wheeler."

Primary objective is to leverage edge computing to establish secure data mining, harness edge storage for swift responses, and minimize latency, particularly crucial for processing time-sensitive data. Through testing, we transferred 100 files to both cloud and edge devices, revealing superior performance by edge device. For instance, transfer time for a single file was a mere 0.004 seconds on edge compared to 1 second on cloud. Our work seamlessly integrates cloud, edge, and data creation components. Utilizing facial recognition data comprising 100 encrypted images stored on edge devices, our system efficiently processes user requests. End-to-end encrypted data transmission occurs, with the cloud handling search queries sent to the edge, which houses the encrypted data. Results are sent to clouds after decryption, guaranteeing improved technological progress through data security and search effectiveness.

There are several well-known design issues with CNNs: they are naturally prone to overfit and it is difficult to find good hyperparameters. Tackle these problems in NeuroFusion by utilizing CSO to fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, kernel size, dropout rates) via bio-inspired stochastic search State-Of-the-art accuracy (96.52%) on the ADNI dataset is reported for the model, surpassing the traditional CNNs (92%) and machine learning methods (e.g., SVM: 83%).

In this paper, we address a central bottleneck in such pipelines: the removal of infrared (IR) contamination from the RGB channels. The IR crosstalk leakage leads to colour degradation, desaturation, and hue shifts, especially under high IR illumination. We study the spatial characteristics of this crosstalk in controlled laboratory conditions across diverse illumination intensities, and introduce a lightweight U-Net-based convolutional model with a task-specific loss that prioritizes spatially challenging, IR-contaminated pixels. Building on the standard linear contamination hypothesis, our model predicts per-channel coefficients that can integrate with conventional ISP stages, while adapting the correction to spatial outliers such as radial vignetting and edge artefacts."

    "abstract": "Dental plague leads to several bacterial diseases which includes caries (tooth decay), periodontitis (Gum diseases), tooth erosion and oral cancer. Hence detection and classification of the dental plague is becoming prevalent to maintain the dental health among healthcare professional. Among multiple dental diseases, periodontal disease is increasing its attention due to its severity among multiple peoples. Traditionally, periodontal disease is identified manually by dental professional and it leads to several challenge time consuming procedures probing force and difference among examiner. However, accurate diagnosis and classification of the disease becomes mandatory. Thus many computer vision approaches using machine learning architecture has been employed but it leads to generalization issues. To combat those challenges, a new deep learning model entitled as transfer learning architecture using pre-trained ResNet 121 model is designed to detect and classify the periodontal diseases through skip connection is designed in this article. Model is training is carried out with periodontal X-ray images dataset. Initially dataset is preprocessed using noise filtering approach, normalization approach and contrast enhancement approach to enhance the image for detection and classification process. Preprocessed image is projected to graph cut segmentation approaches for disease segmentation. Segmented regions are processed in the different layer of the ResNetarchitecture. Especially transfer learning architecture incorporates residual connections to provide learned feature to the periodontal segmented images. Those learned features is projected to the periodontal segmented images to extract the hierarchical features and represents its outcomes in form feature map. Next, feature map is employed to the fully connected layer composed of the activation function to linearize the disease feature and Softmax function uses naïve bayes classifier for periodontitis disease detection and classification and loss function uses cross entropy to reduce over fitting and underfitting issues of the model. Experimental analysis of the proposed model is performed using training data of the benchmark dataset considered as periodontal x ray dataset which is classifies the disease into stages such as early periodontitis, mild periodontitis and severe periodontitis. Model exhibits better processing capabilities compared to the conventional approaches. Further performance analysis of the model is performed using test data of the dataset on establish confusion matrix to compute the model accuracy. On those analyses, it is proved that proposed model exhibits detection and classification accuracy of 98.2% which is considered to higher that conventional approaches."

This framework, developed previously, offers both a natural representation of uncertainty for robustness and does not require a dense discretization of the trajectory history near obstacles. Differing from the original implementation, this work develops a homotopic Bayesian solution to the same problem to avoid reliance on algorithmic convergence. The method is applied to a planar, spacecraft rendezvous scenario and shown to provide collision avoidant trajectories while retaining the smooth dynamical flow of the prior."

In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings."

This survey critically reviews machine learning (ML)-driven approaches for cybersecurity threat detection and mitigation, focusing on the limitations of current supervised and semi-supervised methods. While effective for known attacks, these models often fail to detect zero-day exploits, struggle with high-dimensional network data, and depend heavily on labeled datasets, which are often incomplete or insecure. To address these challenges, this review explores advanced unsupervised learning techniques such as deep clustering, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANS) that can extract hidden patterns from unlabeled traffic and improve anomaly detection. The paper’s key contribution lies in identifying research gaps and proposing a novel direction: integrating unsupervised learning with federated and reinforcement learning frameworks to build scalable, privacy-preserving, and adaptive security systems. This study highlights the potential of such integration to enable proactive and resilient cyber defense mechanisms, offering a significant advancement in intelligent cybersecurity solutions."

Specifically, we investigate how quantum-inspired techniques like Tensor Networks (TNs) such as the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) with Matrix Product States (MPS) can be utilized for the QELM algorithm. We applied the QELM technique to predict activity (ACT) values based on molecular descriptors from the Merck Molecular Activity Challenge (MMACD) dataset. Overall, the results show that TNs can balance performance and accuracy in simulating quantum dynamics, allowing the simulation of datasets with a high number of features.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing poses unique challenges for computer science students due to the field's reliance on mathematical formalism, abstract physical concepts, and unfamiliar notation. While computer science students are typically proficient in algorithmic thinking and systems design, they often lack the background in quantum mechanics and linear algebra necessary to navigate the field's conceptual landscape. This mismatch can result in a form of disciplinary dissonance, a ‘Quantum Babel', where understanding breaks down due to divergent cognitive and notational frameworks. This paper proposes a layered, analogy-driven pedagogical framework that re-contextualizes quantum concepts using metaphors and structures familiar to CS learners. Grounded in cognitive load theory and analogical reasoning, the approach aims to reduce extraneous cognitive load through metaphorical scaffolding. For example, the quantum Hamiltonian is recast as an operating system task scheduler, facilitating intuitive understanding of time evolution and energy landscapes in quantum systems. We present a series of conceptual mappings and illustrative examples that enable learners to build quantum intuition using analogies drawn from classical computing domains such as signal processing, debugging, and resource scheduling. Our goal is to foster quantum intuition in learners without requiring a deep background in physics, supporting the emergence of a new generation of quantum-literate computer scientists. This work contributes to the growing field of quantum software engineering education and lays the foundation for empirically validated, cross-disciplinary teaching tools."

    "abstract": "The rapid escalation of wireless data demand, fueled by the widespread adoption of smart devices and the surge in multimedia consumption, presents critical challenges to the scalability of current wireless network infrastructures—particularly regarding bandwidth limitations, storage constraints, and latency management. To address these issues, content caching and Device to Device (D2D) communication have gained traction as efficient methods for mitigating traffic congestion during network peak times. This study explores adaptive caching mechanisms by considering user mobility behaviors and content popularity trends to make informed caching decisions. A novel caching strategy based on Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) is introduced to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE), maintain data privacy, and reduce reliance on centralized systems and backhaul infrastructure. The proposed framework is empirically compared with three baseline methods: Collaborative Filtering with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and conventional Federated Learning (FL). Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the HFL based model delivers superior performance in terms of cache hit rate, latency reduction, and overall scalability making it a viable approach for next generation wireless networks such as 5G and beyond. The proposed HFL based framework achieved up to 15% higher cache hit rate and 12% lower latency compared to existing methods, demonstrating its potential for scalable and privacy preserving content delivery in 5G networks."

This research proposes a multilingual, open-domain conversational AI platform designed for Indian users that supports ten major languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, and English. The system operates upon Sarvam AI Services, and integrates Google Gemini Pro. As such the system allows for seamless engagement across text, voice, document analysis, web search, and live screen sharing. The platform keeps conversations culturally sensitive and contextually relevant, because it exhibits strong management of multi- faceted Indic scripts, code-mixing, plus regional accents. An audio system exhibited increased accuracy with more natural voice synthesis and experimental evaluations validate the OCR- based processing of documents consistently across varied real-world use cases. The main contribution of this work is its development of a scaling and culturally adaptive framework that is for multilingual AI, which will enable inclusive access to education, healthcare, governance, and business services in India for its extensive population and advance the design of conversational AI systems that are localized, multimodal, socially just in consideration to users, and bridge the digital language barrier."

As components of electronic devices become smaller, the impact of electron beam irradiation becomes more severe, and the use of low beam acceleration voltages coupled with low beam current is recommended to avoid transistor damage [1]–[2]. Necessity for lower beam current leads to much reduced nanoprobing imaging signals, and thus lower overall signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we describe the development of a novel pA noise-level amplifier for RCI and EBIC measurements of high impedance samples. A peak-to-peak noise level of 3 pA is shown here with this new amplifier. We compare experimental performance of this novel low noise amplifier to an established reference amplifier and illustrate the gained benefits and new limits for RCI measurements."

Conventional IDS (typically based on signature- or rule-based IDS) are usually poor performers against zero-day attacks and have to be frequently updated manually. The paper aims to compare machine learning (ML), ensemble learning and federated learning (FL) as the strategies to optimize IDS in scalability and data privacy limitations. Based on the Modern Secure Computing Anomaly Dataset (MSCAD), several supervised classifiers such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting were benchmarked with ensemble methods namely Bagging, Boosting and Stacking. Moreover, an FL framework that is privacy-prestanding was deployed to determine the effects of intrusion detection in a distributed environment using many nodes. Stacked ensembles models performed best with a given accuracy score of 96.3%, and FL model was also performing comparatively well with an accuracy score of 94.5%. The results reveal that federated approaches coupled with ensemble approaches can eventually achieve scalability, accuracy, and privacy-preserving IDS solutions which have practical potentials of application in IoT, industry, and multi-organizational networks."

The PPF-based method involves preprocessing point clouds, clustering objects, and matching through the calculation of PPF descriptors for each object and the target.

The design of cost-effective hybrid quantum-classical learning systems is therefore imperative for various applications, including biosignal processing in the healthcare sector. This motivates the investigation into the reduction of computational complexity of a hybrid quantumclassical neural network. We propose a new hybrid model combining a quantum neural network (QNN) with a binary neural network (BNN), known as quBNN, with the aim to reduce model complexity. For benchmarking, we consider a classical multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a standard nonbinarised version of quBNN that combines a QNN with an MLP, named as quilp. We evaluated all models on a multi-class dataset containing multimodal biosignals. We find that quMLP can outperform the classical MLP with minimal additional complexity, while quBNN maintains performance comparable with the classical MLP, with reduced computational complexity. We apply pruning and quantisation techniques to the QNN within the proposed quBNN model, aiming to further reduce its complexity. This compression yields substantial reductions in parameter and quantum gate count when compiled for quantum hardware, albeit with performance degradation."

In this paper, we extend this approach by exploring alternative distance metrics to more accurately capture the effect of gradient staleness. We integrate these metrics into the aggregation process and evaluate their impact on convergence speed, model performance, and training stability under heterogeneous clients and non-IID data settings. Our results demonstrate that certain metrics lead to more robust and efficient asynchronous FL training, offering a stronger foundation for practical deployment."

The proposed tool is divided into two main sections: advantage may happen based on by year or by hardware evolutions for a determined problem and hardware specification. In both sections, a user can select a set of input parameters to verify the resulting runtimes and costs of quantum and classical parts to determine if quantum advantage will be achievable. Our application demonstrates that, despite limited information from vendors, we can still obtain accurate predictions to determine the realization of quantum advantage."

The algorithm is improved based on YOLOv8n by first redesigning the convolution module using SCConv, and proposing a lighter C2f-SCConv convolution module to replace the C2f module in the YOLOv8 backbone, thus limiting feature redundancy and enhancing feature representation; In addition, the deformable attention mechanism DAttention is incorporated into the original algorithm to extract features with lower complexity; Finally the addition of the P2 detection head enhances the capture of fine-grained features. The experimental results show that the performance of the improved model is significantly improved compared to the commonly used models such as YOLOv5s, Faster R-CNN, and SSD. Relative to the base model mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively. The algorithm improves the performance while ensuring that the number of parameters does not increase additionally, to meet the accuracy and timeliness requirements of the task of detecting abnormal targets in the state of the guard plate."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is not just reshaping industries but also reshaping how we think and solve problems, profoundly influencing the fabric of human cognition. The psychological implications of convenience go far beyond just that, revealing an often-blighted double-edged sword. As AI liberates more potential by easing complicated jobs, increasing accuracy, and offering intelligent solutions, it develops some serious risks by suppressing critical thinking and worsening mental health issues. In this paper, we propose the AI-Human Cognition Framework; a model designed to redefine AI’s role as a cognitive enhancer rather than a replacement. Active participation comes through modular scaffolding for structured support, an adaptive interface for personalized engagement, and dynamic feedback loops for continuous cognitive refinement through two-way diagnostics. The paradigm guarantees that AI promotes intellectual resilience rather than passive dependence by being based on ethical concepts including transparency, user agency, and cognitive well-being. It is with this integration of AI and mutual learning that the approach envisions a future where AI enhances human reasoning, fosters mental resilience, and leads to an integrated and trusting human-technology partnership."

    "abstract": "Quantum combinatorial optimization algorithms typically face challenges owing to complex optimization landscapes featuring numerous local minima, exponentially scaling latent spaces, and susceptibility to quantum hardware noise. In this study, we introduce Direct Entanglement Ansatz Learning (DEAL), wherein we employ a direct mapping from quadratic unconstrained binary problem parameters to quantum ansatz for cost and mixer Hamiltonians, which improves the convergence rate towards the optimal solution. Our approach exploits a quantum entanglement-based ansatz to effectively explore intricate latent spaces and zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) to mitigate the randomness caused by crosstalk and coherence errors. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that DEAL increases the success rate compared to the classic quantum approximation optimization algorithm while controlling the error variance. In addition, we demonstrate the capability of DEAL to provide near-optimum ground energy solutions for traveling salesman, knapsack, and maxcut problems, which facilitates novel paradigms for solving relevant NPhard problems and extends the self-contained practical applicability of quantum optimization using noisy quantum hardware."

To address these challenges, an automatic segmentation algorithm specifically designed for point cloud data of cable laying areas in three-dimensional tunnel scenarios is proposed. The algorithm integrates multiple key steps, including the removal of tunnel inner wall point clouds to eliminate interference, precise segmentation of cable point clouds from complex backgrounds, and accurate extraction of the cable laying area for subsequent parameter analysis. Experimental results validate the high accuracy of the proposed method: in the three key processes of cable laying, the F1-scores for cable segmentation reach 0.961,0.972, and 0.955 respectively; for the four core parameters (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mu_{\\mathrm{i}}-\\mu_{4}$</tex>) of the laying area, the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{F}1$</tex>-scores range from 0.947 to 0.976.

However, it should be noted that in many real-world cases, the patterns are often mislabeled and not correct, which will negatively affect the effectiveness of wafer map defect detection. In this work, firstly, we use two types of noise, symmetric noise and pair noise to simulate the real-world mislabeling scenarios in the wafer map defect detection process. Then we propose a robust method for wafer map defect detection under mislabeled patterns, a pattern updating technique is used to rectify the mislabeled pattern. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments on a real-world wafer map dataset."

These networks are very important in areas like environmental monitoring, healthcare, military activities, and industrial systems. One major problem that exists in WSNs is locating the unknown nodes as efficiently as possible since the whole concept of these networks is to locate these unknown nodes with respect to known anchor nodes. The proposed research will emphasize secure localization, an important concern with the possibility of adversaries taking advantage of or compromising the satellites’ location, thus disturbing the integrity and the working of the network. The development of WSN is as a result of advancement in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), digital electronics, and wireless communication. This development made it possible to manufacture small, powerful, and efficient sensor nodes. In this paper, we analyze the currently available secure localization algorithms, point out the issues associated with them, and provide new solutions for these problems. This work seeks to increase the stability and dependability of WSNs by designing efficient approaches for secure node placement for their effective use in diverse modern systems. This study advances SDG Goals 11 and 13 by improving secure localization methods in wireless sensor networks, hence providing robust and dependable node placement for sustainable urban infrastructure and climate-adaptive smart cities."

Delamination was observed between the die and the underfill. It is suspected moisture penetrated through the underfill and substrate interface and caused this delamination during the HAST. However, there is no appropriate method to detect the moisture penetration path. It is because the diameter of the water moisture (H<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>O) molecule is about 2.8 angstrom.

To solve the above challenge, this work applied a deuterium oxide (D<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>O) isotope tracing method to investigate the moisture penetration path in the SoC package.

The results showed that that moisture penetrated through the underfill and substrate interface faster than that of underfill itself. It may be due to the gap between the underfill and substrate is bigger than underfill material itself. The work provided a directly way to find out the faster moisture penetration path and Engineers can improve the whole package's moisture resistance accordingly."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper proposes a QRLNAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search (QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its effectiveness and practical utility."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Dynamic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (DNMPC) algorithm for OMR, establishes the corresponding trajectory tracking error model, and designs a cost function that integrates both hard and soft constraints, along with practical system limitations. The optimization problem is solved online using a receding horizon strategy in model predictive control, formulated as a quadratic programming problem. Preliminary and advanced validations are conducted in MATLAB and Gazebo, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm ensures accurate trajectory tracking under low to moderate speeds (below 10 m/s), while satisfying various system constraints. This study provides technical support for the engineering application of OMR control in low- and medium-speed scenarios."

    "abstract": "Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is an effective technique for mitigating the severe dynamics of underwater acoustic (UWA) channels. However, its performance strongly relies on accurate channel state prediction, and prediction errors can cause significant performance degradation. Most existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain (TD) prediction, but the rapid variability of UWA channels makes long-term prediction highly challenging and limits their effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, we exploit the relative stability and sparsity of channel parameters in the delay–Doppler (DD) domain and propose a multi-scale convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) prediction framework. The DD-domain formulation reduces model complexity and supports multi-step forecasting, while the multi-scale architecture captures channel dynamics across different temporal scales and structural levels. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on real-world UWA measurements. The proposed framework achieves a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.0818 in the DD-domain, significantly lower than the 0.2196 NMSE of direct TD prediction. Compared to conventional predictors, the proposed framework consistently reduces NMSE by approximately 70% across multiple datasets, thereby enhancing the robustness and feasibility of long-horizon channel forecasting for AMC systems."

    "abstract": "Current markets of air conditioners are highly competitive, therefore the manufactures focus on comfort improvements and decreasing costs. The best practice in cost reduction is the exclusion of several circuits or parts in the device and the transfer of their functions to other parts and control algorithms. For example, the cost of air conditioners can be significantly decreased if lubricant preheaters, implemented as separate devices, are excluded and compressor oil is heated using motor windings as heaters. The main disadvantage of this approach is an increase in heating time, caused by the distant location of motor and oil. To overcome the abovementioned problem, this paper proposes dynamic heating of the lubricant oil, which significantly decreases the time required for preheating. Instead of conventional oil-sump heating, the authors suggest heating the oil pump located inside the motor shaft. If the temperature of the oil pump is hot enough, the cold oil, moving from the oil sump at the bottom to compressor moving parts at the top, heats during pumping and reaches the target parts having the required temperature. Therefore, the proposed method excludes conventional preheater and decreases preheating time at 4.1% and 22.2%, comparing to internal and external preheaters, respectively."

By evaluating the concentration of energy among dominant singular values of the Mosaic-Hankel matrix, the proposed method ensures that only informative and high-quality data are incorporated into the dataset. This allows DeePC to maintain both feasibility and robustness while adapting online. Through autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking experiments under varying longitudinal velocities, the effectiveness of the ESVR-Optimized update is validated, where it achieves improved tracking accuracy compared to rank-based update strategies."

    "abstract": "An optical phased array (OPA) is a device capable of forming and scanning arbitrary optical beams without any mechanical moving parts. We are developing an OPA using organic electro-optic (EO) polymers that exhibit ultrahigh speed and low power consumption. The deflection angle of an OPA depends on the pitch of the waveguide's output section; thus, a narrower pitch is required to increase the deflection angle. Here, we propose an organic–inorganic dual-layer OPA that uses EO polymer waveguides as phase shifters and silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides as the output section. Because SiN has a higher refractive index than the EO polymer, it provides strong optical confinement, enabling a narrower waveguide pitch. This study describes a transition section designed to transfer light between the EO polymer waveguide and SiN waveguides. Numerical calculations show that a transition section with tapered SiN waveguides achieves a coupling loss of 0.76 dB, while experimental measurements indicate a coupling loss of 1.67 dB. Optical experiments on devices fabricated via a layering process demonstrated a beam divergence angle of 1.917° and a maximum deflection angle of 36.64° from optical beams emitted by a SiN grating array with a 2.5 μm pitch at the emission section."

    "abstract": "Integrated air-ground communication (IAGC) has emerged as a promising solution to deliver seamless wireless coverage and high-data-rate services. However, potential malicious eavesdroppers pose a serious threat to the confidential transmission in IAGC due to their non-cooperative behaviors and the inherent openness of communication channels. To tackle this problem, a dynamic spectrum control (DSC)-based transmission scheme is proposed to enhance covert performance and communication reliability in IAGC. With the proposed scheme, we apply the principles of block cryptography, perform adaptive iterative and orthogonal transformations to generate sequence sets that drive transmission decisions. Guided by these sequences, multiple legitimate users can dynamically occupy different frequency slots and transmit data simultaneously. In addition, we analyze the probability of frequency slot multiplexing when several data groups occupy the same frequency slot in a time slot, resulting in the closed-form expression for the detection error probability. We then derive the maximum reliable transmission probability and ergodic rate subject to the covert communication constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve superior covert performance compared with benchmark schemes. Furthermore, we evaluate and discuss the effects of key parameters in the proposed DSC-based transmission scheme on communication security and reliability."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a robust active/reactive power (P-Q) regulation framework for solar photovoltaic (PV) driven grid-following inverters (GFLIs) that relies on a cascaded control architecture consisting of a primary current control layer and a secondary P-Q control layer. Generally, GFLIs face oscillatory instability issues, particularly under external grid disturbances, due to the limitations of conventional linear controllers such as proportional-integral (PI) control. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel P-Q control strategy that integrates integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) with a nonlinear disturbance observer (DOB). The proposed method enhances dynamic response, improves disturbance rejection, and ensures robust power delivery despite system uncertainties and disturbances. Additionally, it significantly improves the stability of the DC-link voltage and current during transient conditions. The parameter selection of the controller is performed numerically and using MATLAB simulations for a single-bus GFLI network. The feasibility of the proposed controller is further evaluated using OPAL-RT real-time simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system, including three GFLIs located at different locations across varying X/R ratios. The observations demonstrate that the proposed control architecture outperforms the conventional method by providing precise power regulation and superior transient stability under realistic disturbance scenarios."

    "abstract": "This work focuses on developing and integrating a two-week introductory quantum computing module into a 200 level undergraduate hardware/software course. The course,required for applied computing majors (e.g., information systems), covers major elements of hardware and software design, such as instruction sets, serial communication,and memory management. It begins with classical bits, binary arithmetic, and digital logic gates. Recognizing the need to prepare students for emerging computationalparadigms, the course has evolved to introduce fundamental quantum concepts and gates, offering a clear parallel to their classical counterparts. This module covers coreideas such as superposition, entanglement, and the operation of essential quantum gates like the Hadamard and CNOT, including how they are represented by matrices and how their operations can be visualized with Bloch spheres. Drawing inspiration from the Quantum Computing, Math, and Physics (QCaMP) program at Sandia National Laboratories, the module is designed to be accessible, emphasizing conceptual understanding and practical implications. This poster details the pedagogical approach, learningoutcomes, and initial implementation strategies. The goal of this work is to provide a practical first step toward integrating foundational quantum literacy into existingapplied computing curricula, equipping students with a holistic understanding of classical and quantum computing principles for future advancements."

    "abstract": "Strategic efforts to advance research and development in emerging technologies require a skilled technical workforce equipped to contribute to the innovation ecosystem. In recognition of this need, multiple federal agencies and several states have invested in workforce development initiatives and programs to build talent pathways to careers in quantum information science and technology, data science, and artificial intelligence. The education and workforce development efforts span the entire talent ecosystem, encompassing K-12 education, undergraduate and graduate education, faculty development, and professional development for workforce professionals. These workforce development initiatives and programs include courses, workshops, professional development for K-12 educators, undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, entrepreneurial fellowships, and research opportunities in national labs, research centers, institutes, and alliances. Despite substantial investment in these efforts, a gap remains between the demand for talent and the availability of skilled professionals. It highlights the need to improve our understanding of the impact and scale of promising practices in these educational and training opportunities, while also recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be suitable for bridging this gap. In addition, while many research centers and institutes have begun to integrate education, outreach, and workforce initiatives into their portfolios, the landscape remains fragmented and largely undocumented at scale. To address this issue, we conducted a portfolio analysis grounded in data from over 130 Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) focused research centers and institutes. We identified opportunities for education and outreach, partnerships, state policies, and funding within the landscape of QISE research centers and institutes. This talk presents insights across the education continuum and introduces an interactive dashboard that visualizes the national QISE education and outreach landscape. The dashboard will be publicly accessible and regularly updated to support the use of students, educators, researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers seeking insights about the quantum information science and engineering ecosystem. Drawing from center websites, publicly available annual reports, and program documentation, we identified and categorized education and outreach across multiple domains, target audiences, and program foci. Preliminary findings suggest that while most centers offer some form of education and outreach, the target audiences, scope, and scale vary widely. Notably, a few initiatives are sustained in collaboration with community-based and minority-serving institutions. This talk will share emerging trends, highlight structural and regional gaps, and conclude with recommendations for policymakers, funders, and center leaders interested in expanding the reach and impact of their quantum education portfolios. Most importantly, this talk may help support educators and other key stakeholders seeking institutional partnerships within their state or region."

    "abstract": "Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is a challenging task that involves segmenting target instances within a top-view image guided by a natural language expression. Existing classic RRSIS methods commonly support target expressions only, i.e., the target described by the expression is present in the image. No-target expressions are excluded. Under this constraint, the model may face significant challenges. For instance, a small error, such as a typographical mistake, could cause a complete failure of the model. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we introduce a new benchmark called Generalized Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (GRRSIS), which extends classic RRSIS by allowing expressions to refer to no-target objects. Towards this, we construct the first large-scale dataset for GRRSIS, called GRRSIS-D, which includes multi-target, single-target, and no-target expressions. Core challenges in GRRSIS stem from the fact that objects in aerial images often occupy only a small number of pixels, exhibit significant orientation variations, and present varying levels of recognition difficulty. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Oriented-aware Multi-Scale Network with an Adaptive Angle Sensing module that integrates Adaptive Rotated Convolution and a gating mechanism to capture diverse object orientations while suppressing irrelevant features for more accurate representations. Additionally, we introduce a novel Online Hard Case Mining Loss, which allocates varying levels of attention to foreground and background regions and reshapes the standard loss by down-weighting well-segmented examples, effectively addressing the issues caused by low pixel occupancy and uneven sample difficulty. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly introduced GRRSIS and classic RRSIS tasks."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2025.3639077",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) using 1-D sensor signals is a widely studied domain and plays an important role in intelligent systems. Traditional research applied a sliding window to extract fixed-size frames from the original signals and ran a classification process on them to recognize activities. However, sliding-window-based methods suffer from several problems, such as the multi-class windows problem, where all sample points share the same label in a frame even if there is more than one activity in it. The sliding window also makes it challenging to decide the best window length for all activities and causes the computational cost problem due to the redundant calculation of two consecutive frames. To solve the problems of sliding windows, in this paper, we design a novel sliding-window-free method that can recognize all activities from signal segments in a highly efficient way. As a solution, we propose grid transition labeling, which is derived from the object detection tasks in 2-D images, and we introduce new designs to deal with 1-D signal-based HAR tasks. Grid transition labeling regards the transition between two activities as an object. To detect transitions, grid transition labeling divides a segment into several grids and labels whether there is a transition in each grid, as well as the classes around transitions, therefore all sample points of the segment can be well labeled without the need of labeling each of them. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on two datasets, including UCI HAPT and WISDM. The results on the two datasets show accuracies of 0.930 and 0.939 respectively, outperforming two sliding-window-free methods, FCN and U-Net. Our method also has a high computational efficiency that requires much less computational cost for inference compared to both the sliding-window-based methods and the sliding-window-free methods, making it more suitable for applications on edge devices such as smartwatches and smartphones."

    "abstract": "The dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA), with its unique characteristics of subwavelength spacing and real-time reconfigurability of elements, is considered a potential technique for future wireless communication systems. With these characteristics, DMAs can offer a high-capacity, low-cost, and energy-efficient solution for high spectral efficiency demands. Despite these advantages, in conventional DMA architectures, the number of microstrips increases with the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. This paper presents a novel fully connected DMA-based architecture for reducing the number of RF chains in downlink multiple-input single-output systems. In this architecture, we combine the signals from the RF chains (fewer than the number of microstrips) and map the resulting composite signals to the input port of each microstrip via an analog precoding unit. We develop a gradient projection-manifold optimization algorithm to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the single-user (SU) scenario and propose an alternating optimization algorithm to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system for the multi-user (MU) scenario. The simulation results show comparable WSR and SNR performances of the existing and proposed architectures, whereas the proposed architecture achieves higher energy efficiency in both the SU and MU scenarios."

    "abstract": "The convergence of information and operational technology networks has created previously unforeseen security issues. To address these issues, both researchers and practitioners have integrated threat intelligence methods into the security operations of converged networks, with some of the most valuable tools being honeypots that imitate industrial control systems (ICS). However, the development and deployment of such honeypots is a process rich with pitfalls, which can lead to undiagnosed weaknesses in the threat intelligence being gathered. This paper presents a side-channel method of covertly identifying ICS honeypots using the time-to-live (TTL) values of target devices. We show that many ICS honeypots can be readily identified, via minimal interactions, using only basic networking tools. In a study of over 8,000 devices presenting as ICS systems, we detail how our method compares to an existing honeypot detection approach, and outline what our methodology reveals about the current population of live ICS honeypots. In demonstrating our method, this study aims to raise awareness of the viability of the TTL heuristic and the prevalence of its misconfiguration despite its presence in literature."

While deep learning models outperform traditional statistical methods in time series forecasting, they remain unreliable for network traffic due to limited adaptability to traffic fluctuations and diverse patterns. We present TUBO, a novel machine learning framework tailored for reliable traffic demand matrix (DM) forecasting. TUBO comprises two core components: a burst processor that isolates and predicts sudden traffic spikes, and a model selector that dynamically chooses the most suitable forecasting model from a diverse pool based on input characteristics and uncertainty estimation. This enables TUBO to deliver accurate, robust, and uncertainty-aware predictions. Evaluations on three real-world datasets (Abilene, GEANT, and CERNET) show that TUBO improves forecasting accuracy by up to $10 \\times$ and achieves $\\mathbf{9 4 \\%}$ accuracy in burst occurrence prediction. As a downstream application, we apply TUBO to proactive traffic engineering (TE) and demonstrate throughput gains of $\\mathbf{9} \\times$ and $\\mathbf{3} \\times$ over reactive TE and the best prior proactive TE approach, respectively."

MSA proposes a feature extraction model from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and text classification from Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. For better comprehension of words from text, word representations such as FastText and GloVe are utilized, wherein FastText provides enhanced out-of-vocabulary word handling with subword-level representation. The model also includes attention mechanisms to focus the model onto the most descriptive image and text input areas. Employed since the dataset is 1,428 labeled instances, each a combination of an image, a caption for the image, and a positive or negative sentiment label. Preprocessing techniques such as image normalization and text tokenization are applied to pre-process the data into trainable form. Comparative experiment shows the peak accuracy is at 90%, which best performance is that CNN-BiLSTM constructed with FastText embedding, having exceeded the stand-alone CNN, stand-alone LSTMs, as well as all other model hybrids. It attests to the power of consolidating multimodal information and then deriving superior, state-of-the-art sentiment prediction. This has clear, immediate practical relevance across social surveillance, personalized recommendatory systems, emotive human-computer interactions, and social monitoring content control, among real-world applications.

QAE-Net replaces the classical excitation block of Squeeze-and-Excitation modules with a shallow Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to capture higher-order inter-channel dependencies that are challenging to model with purely classical approaches. We evaluate QAE-Net on benchmark image classification tasks, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10, and observe consistent performance improvements across all datasets, with particularly notable gains on tasks involving three-channel inputs. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of variational layers in the quantum circuit leads to progressively higher classification accuracy, underscoring the expressivity benefits of deeper quantum models. These findings highlight the potential of integrating VQCs into CNN architectures to improve representational capacity while maintaining compatibility with nearterm quantum devices. The proposed approach is tailored for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering a scalable and feasible pathway for deploying quantum-enhanced attention mechanisms in practical deep learning workflows."

The proposed approach employs pre-experimental tests to identify the optimal performance functions within each module through a greedy strategy.

Therefore, an energy management model for a VPP integrated in a radial distribution network is presented, using the standardized IEEE 33-node system as a reference. The optimization model was implemented in GurobiPy considering the operational constraints of each DER, as well as the technical limitations of the network, using a power flow approach. In addition, it allows optimal sizing of energy resources to maximize the economic gains of the VPP and incorporates a demand response strategy to reduce consumption at times of high prices. The results are supported by AC power flow simulations in PandaPower, optimizing the technical performance of the network by reducing losses and improving voltage profiles in different scenarios."

    "abstract": "The Index Modulation-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM-IM) technique has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional OFDM in recent years, offering performance enhancements. However, high-frequency operations in 5G and beyond networks introduce challenges like hardware impairments (HWIs) and channel fading, making it essential to evaluate their effects on system performance and develop solutions. This study investigates the benefits of Golaycoded OFDM-IM systems compared to their uncoded counterparts. Experimental validation using the LabVIEW platform and USRP-2439R hardware demonstrates that Golay coding significantly enhances BER performance across varying Energy per Bit to Noise Power Ratio (Eb/N0) conditions. The results indicate that the Golay-coded system achieves up to 37% BER reduction at low Eb/N0 levels (-25.83 dB) and maintains a $\\mathbf{2 3 \\%}$ improvement at $\\mathbf{- 1 6. 6 7 ~ d B}$, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating transmission errors across various Eb/N0 levels. These findings contribute to advancing secure and efficient communication technologies, particularly for IoT applications."

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks represent a research field that has attracted significant attention in recent years, mainly due to their stealthiness and high success rates. The main goal of backdoor attacks is to manipulate the model's behavior during inference. This is achieved by embedding hidden triggers in the training data and potentially modifying training labels. With the growing integration of AI models into autonomous systems, backdoor attacks present a critical security risk. Various defense strategies have been developed to mitigate these threats. The most notable category of defenses relies on reconstructing the trigger pattern from the poisoned model. However, we observe that current defense methods demonstrate suboptimal performance with respect to trigger similarity as well as computational and memory efficiency. In this paper, we propose D-FEAT, a novel method that significantly reduces memory and time consumption compared to existing defenses. The reduction in time and memory requirements enables our method to be applied effectively in real-world scenarios. Using a lightweight neural network, we reconstruct the backdoor trigger entirely within the model's feature space, where the representations are denser and more abstract. It requires no assumptions about the form of the trigger, nor does it require scanning classes to identify a potential trigger, unlike many other methods. We evaluated our method on benchmark datasets and found it to perform, on average, comparably to or better than state-of-the-art defenses in backdoor mitigation. Additionally, D-FEAT excels in backdoor removal consistency, effectively mitigating every attack tested."

Compared to previous work, this work introduces a double-sided crosstalk attack where attacker's circuits are located on either side of the victim circuit executing in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum computer. The attacker, a malicious tenant or user, can interfere with, or disrupt, the state of neighboring qubits in the victim tenant or user without direct access to victim's qubits, by taking advantage of interference and crosstalk among the otherwise logically isolated qubits. New aspect of this attack is the location of the attacker's circuits on both sides of the victim. Experimental validation on cloud-based Rigetti quantum devices demonstrates that these attacks can compromise data integrity and cause the victim's circuit's outputs to change. Magnitude of the change is evaluated using total variational distance and tested on number of common benchmarks that can execute on today's quantum computers. This work underscores the need for improved isolation mechanisms and secure scheduling in multitenant quantum computing cloud environments."

The paper provides its solution of an AI/ML-Styled model which classifies, diagnoses, and recognizes the paddy leaf illness with an excellent precision. A large amount of the image collection on the variants of the diseases was taken and a list of the preprocessing mechanisms was employed to keep up with the application such as the removal of the noise and division of the images that can enhance the quality of the picture. CNN, MobileNet, ViT and Hybrid networks were used to perform developments of deep learning. The basis of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and inference time was used to perform an analysis of a performance. The other models of learning namely the hybrid and transfer models produced a better result due to the over 98 per cent accuracy. The results interpretation was based on visual tools that included use of bar graphics, spider charts and heatmaps. Distribution of data and data scaling was solved with data augmentation. The implementation of the system in the mobile/ web structures, as proposed is capable of making the diagnosis of the disease on the field in real-time in the resource-less rural environment."

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical in reducing the impact of noise in the pre-fault-tolerant era, and is expected to complement error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). In this paper, we propose a novel QEM approach, Q-Cluster, that uses unsupervised learning (clustering) to reshape the measured bit-string distribution. Our approach starts with a simplified bit-flip noise model. It first performs clustering on noisy measurement results, i.e., bit-strings, based on the Hamming distance. The centroid of each cluster is calculated using a qubit-wise majority vote. Next, the noisy distribution is adjusted with the clustering outcomes and the bitflip error rates using Bayesian inference. Our simulation results show that Q-Cluster can mitigate high noise rates (up to 40% per qubit) with the simple bit-flip noise model. However, real quantum computers do not fit such a simple noise model. To address the problem, we (a) apply Pauli twirling to tailor the complex noise channels to Pauli errors, and (b) employ a machine learning model, ExtraTrees regressor, to estimate an effective bit-flip error rate using a feature vector consisting of machine calibration data (gate & measurement error rates), circuit features (number of qubits, numbers of different types of gates, etc.) and the shape of the noisy distribution (entropy). Our experimental results show that our proposed Q-Cluster scheme improves the fidelity by a factor of 1.46x, on average, compared to the unmitigated output distribution, for a set of low-entropy benchmarks on five different IBM quantum machines. Our approach outperforms the state-of-art QEM approaches RZNE [28], M3 [24], Hammer [35], and QBEEP [33] by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.26 \\mathrm{x}, 1.29 \\mathrm{x}, 1.47 \\mathrm{x}$</tex>, and 2.65 x, respectively."

    "abstract": "Ising machines, including quantum annealing machines, are promising next-generation computers for combinatorial optimization problems. Due to hardware limitations, most Ising-type hardware can only solve functions expressed in linear or quadratic terms of binary variables. Therefore, problems with higher-order terms require order reduction, which increases the number of variables and constraints and may degrade solution quality. This study evaluates the effectiveness of directly solving such problems without order reduction by using the polynomial unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) solver implemented in Toshiba's Simulated Quantum-inspired Bifurcation Machine+ (SQBM+). We compare its performance against a conventional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solver on the same hardware platform. As benchmarks, we use a vehicle routing problem with distance balancing and the low autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem, both of which naturally include higher-order interactions. Results show that the PUBO solver consistently achieves superior solution quality and stability compared to its QUBO counterpart, while maintaining comparable computational time and requiring no order-reduction compilation, indicating the potential advantages of directly handling higher-order terms in practical optimization problems."

Most previous work on VQLS applications in semiconductor device simulations focuses on solving the Poisson equation, where the coefficient matrix of the sparse linear system is real and symmetric. Solving the quantum transport equation, however, leads to coefficient matrices that are complex and non-symmetric. This work addresses the challenges of applying VQLS to quantum transport simulations. We propose new forms of cost functions to solve complex and non-symmetric linear systems with faster computing speed. We further develop efficient decomposition methods for cost function evaluation, which target reducing the quantum circuit complexity and improving noise robustness when solving the quantum transport equation using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. While classical computation faces the challenge of the “curse of dimensionality” as the spatial-energy numerical grid dimensions grow, the proposed quantum-computing-based method scales logarithmically with the grid size, which offers a promising opportunity for addressing the computational challenges of solving quantum transport in semiconductor devices."

To tackle the challenges of small-size effects like short-channel effects, fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs) have emerged. This study, through an instance of memory built-in self-test (MBIST) fault analysis manifested as threshold voltage drift, elaborately expounds two innovative approaches for visualizing and characterizing WELL doping defects in the Memory area of 16nm FinFET chips at the metal layer. First, passive voltage contrast (PVC) is employed to visually characterize the WELL doping defects at the M1 layer. Second, under the condition of low acceleration voltage, the WELL doping defects are visually characterized at the M0 layer by means of the nano-probe electron beam absorption current (EBAC) test method, and the contour of the WELL doping defects is clarified. Research reveals that this method is not only simple and rapid in the test process, but also less destructive and risky compared to methods such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM). More importantly, the methodology successfully achieves the visualization and characterization of large-scale WELL doping defects, allowing us to understand the overall contour of the defects and providing intuitive and accurate data for chip manufacturers to deeply analyze the root causes of failures. The conclusion indicates that this method has significant advantages and application value in the failure analysis of 16FF chips, offering robust technical support for the manufacturing optimization of future chips."

For the detection issue, various architectures of deep learning are used, i.e., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and hybrid models like CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU. Tokenization and padding on the dataset ensure equal input length before training on the model. Evaluation on performance is done on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score with comparative analysis on all models. Experimental evidence reveals that hybrid models are more accurate than independent CNN and RNN architectures, with better classification accuracy and generalization.

    "abstract": "Urban anomalous events, such as traffic congestion and unexpected crowd gatherings, can threaten public safety if not detected in time. Early detection is crucial for enhancing urban safety. However, urban anomaly detection is faced with two major challenges. First, learning anomaly distributions from traffic data is complicated due to the scarcity of anomaly datasets. Second, accurately modeling traffic dynamics is hindered by the frequent absence of traffic datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a adversarial approach for urban anomaly detection across completion spatiotemporal data ($A^{2}-C S T$). This method involves a spatiotemporal generator that predicts normal traffic dynamics and a discriminator that differentiates predicted values from real data. Both components are trained adversarially to mitigate the issue of scarce anomaly data. Given the inherent correlation between nodes in the spatiotemporal dimension, we introduce a data completion method based on federated learning. This method combines knowledge from similar nodes with local data to optimize the local data completion model, addressing missing traffic data. We validate the $A^{2}-C S T$ method on both real-world and simulated datasets. The experimental results show that $A^{2}-C S T$ outperforms existing methods in detecting anomalous events. Moreover, the proposed data completion method enhances the effectiveness of $A^{2}-C S T$ in anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "The use of images is no longer limited to humans, as machines have also become consumers of images. With the expansion of neural networks, image-based analytical tools have been developed. Conventional compression approaches like JPEG, H.264, and HEVC are designed to maintain visual quality for human viewing, but they are not optimized for deep learning models employed in computer vision tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object recognition. In addition to superior compression performance, learning-based image compression methods can integrate seamlessly with analytical tasks by utilizing the scalable feature space they generate for computer vision tasks. In this study, a learning-based image compression network is combined with an image classification network and trained using an interactive approach. Employing this approach in network training enhances the scalability of compressed-domain features and stabilizes the training process. The results demonstrate that this approach not only preserves and improves the performance of the compression network compared to traditional methods but also stabilizes the training process and achieves better accuracy for image classification using the extracted features. On average, the proposed method achieves a performance improvement of 7.99%."

A hybrid EMD-wavelet denoising technique reduces diagnostic errors, and anomaly features are extracted from the processed data for fault detection.

In conventional STEM imaging such as Bright-Field (BF), Annular Bright-Field (ABF), Low-Angle Annular Dark-Field (LAADF) and High-Angle Annular Dark-Field (HAADF), the contrast depends on the atomic numbers of the elements in the observed specimen, as well as the atomic density along the direction of the electron beam. However, for layer structures like Silicon Nitride (SiN) / Silicon Oxide (SiO), it has been challenging to distinguish between layers because each layer sometimes consists of a similar composition, such as Silicon oxynitride (SiON). In this report, we introduce the Optimum Bright Field (OBF) STEM, is highly sensitive to differences in the specimen's projected potential, including variations in electromagnetic fields, composition, and atomic density. We performed observation and elemental analysis on a specimen with SiO/SiN layer using STEM. The interfaces of layer structure were not clearly observed in BF, ABF, LAADF, and HAADF images obtained under standard conditions. However, by appropriately adjusting the convergence angle and acquiring ultra-high contrast OBF images, the interfaces of the layer structure was clearly observed. SiN/SiO layer structure verified by OBF image was equivalent to Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) result."

Conventional cognitive testing methods, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), fail to capture the dynamic and high-pressure decision-making skills required for operating complex machinery. To address this gap, six Python-based mini-games were developed using Pygame to evaluate attention, memory, spatial reasoning, problem solving, and decision-making. A cohort of 20 industrial workers was assessed, and the total gamified scores demonstrated a strong positive correlation with MoCA results (r = 0.74, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.682). Furthermore, cognitive retraining and job-role reassignment of a welding operator showed significant improvements in both cognitive performance and operational efficiency. These findings establish the novelty and significance of gamified cognitive assessment as a scalable, engaging, and cost-effective approach to workforce optimization.

Vulnerabilities in Distributed Network protocols, like Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) will make our systems more prone to security breaches. This paper introduces an ensemble learning based network analysis for improved and more reliable intrusion detection system in SCI and DNP3 based architectures. The ensemble model uses multiple AI models to detect breaches, improved accuracy and stability. AI techniques for decision-making are performed. The main content of this work include detailed analysis of the performance of ensemble model, high accuracy in intrusion detection and the consistency of the model in successfully determining attacks across multiple datasets and can handle various types of attack.

    "abstract": "Filtering affinity between strategic themes and academic profiles plays a key role in public policies, mainly in Brazil. Although large language models (LLMs) currently represent the state-of-the-art in text mining, they suffer from limitations such as high computational and financial costs, as well as substantial electricity consumption, particularly in High-Performance Computing environments, which leads to significant carbon emissions. These factors highlight the need for lightweight filtering mechanisms to avoid unnecessary LLM calls. Unsupervised similarity-based filters and binary classifiers also face challenges, including a lack of theme specificity and the requirement for large amounts of labeled data. To address these issues, we propose the use of theme-specific one-class learning, where classifiers are trained using only positive high-affinity examples, combined with the theme description and its keywords. This approach aims to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining filter performance. It requires only a small amount of labeled data, making it suitable even for themes with few known profiles, and provides theme-specific adaptability. We leverage embeddings derived from language models to ensure computational efficiency, and project these embeddings into two dimensions to guarantee interpretability, enabling visualization of the decision function and supporting parameter tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a textual similarity baseline with similar carbon emissions, achieving higher f<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>-scores in identifying relevant pairs.

A tri-layer of Gold/Palladium/Nickle (Au/Pd/Ni) stacking structure has been widely used as a metal surface finish on chip-carrier boards and high-end PCBs. The key role of surface finishes is to prevent oxidation and to preserve solderability. However, the oxidation is difficult to avoid especially for Ni. Conventionally, XPS depth profile is the top priority choice to study the oxygen residual in a tri-layer Au/Pd/Ni pad. However, in this failure case, due to Au and Pd element that were diffused into the Ni layer during XPS depth profiling, it is difficult to make an accurate judgement if there is oxygen residual. The results demonstrated that AES combined with TOFSIMS technique is proven to be an effective method for this particular failure case."

    "abstract": "Parallel Quantum Annealing (PQA) is a technique to improve computational throughput by running multiple independent problems concurrently. However, the concurrent execution of independent problems on a shared physical device gives rise to the possibility of unintended crosstalk mediated by the hardware environment. This work investigates a novel strategy to not only probe but actively harness these interactions. We hypothesize that applying relative time offsets to the annealing schedules of parallel problems can control these environment-mediated dynamics. To show this, we executed two independent ferromagnetic Ising chains (up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$N=500$</tex> qubits) in parallel on a D-Wave quantum annealer, systematically varying the schedule offset of one chain relative to the other. Our experimental results reveal a strong, non-monotonic dependence of the Ground State Probability (GSP) on the applied offset. Most significantly, we discovered non-zero offset regimes where both concurrently running problems achieved higher GSPs than their respective single-run baselines. This counter-intuitive finding of mutual performance enhancement suggests a controllable, cooperative dynamic mediated by the shared quantum environment. This reframes environmental crosstalk from a simple source of error into a potential resource, opening new avenues for schedule optimization and for probing the complex open-system dynamics of near-term quantum devices."

Secondly, we show that, despite recent claims, the direct impact of noise is modest compared to the substantial robustness improvements achieved through increasing the number of qubits.

A number of integrations defines the readout range, where a higher number of integrations is required for a lower capacitance readout. As for the simulation, the design leverages capacitance detection at the sub-pF capacitance range. The results show 0.1mV/2fF and 0.4mV/100fF resolutions for 1-20fF and 0.1-1pF ranges obtained by pre-configuring the input voltage and number of integrations. The output is suitable for digitization using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which is then ready for further processing with a Microcontroller Unit (MCU)."

This paper proposes a prediction model based on the LSTM-Transformer hybrid architecture, combined with the innovative MOBO-EI (Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. The LSTM-Transformer model adopts a dual-channel design: the LSTM layer captures longterm temporal dependency features, and the multi-head attention mechanism identifies the influence weights of key production nodes. After the fusion of these two types of features, a multiobjective quality prediction is output through the fully connected layer. This paper presents a multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm with expected improvement, which innovatively integrates the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function on the basis of the probabilistic surrogate model of Bayesian optimization. It simultaneously optimizes the model validation loss and complexity (parameter scale) to obtain Pareto optimal solutions. Experiments show that on the real tire production dataset, the optimized model proposed in this paper achieves remarkable results. It improves the MSE by 30% and the MAE by 20%. It is particularly effective in predicting targets of different scales, among which the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{2}$</tex> of the small-scale model is increased by 30%, showing obvious improvements compared with traditional models."

By leveraging principles from numerical differential equations, RKIO dynamically adjusts hyperparameters such as learning rate and weight updates, enhancing both convergence speed and model stability. The framework integrates a pretrained Xception network for feature extraction, advanced data augmentation (e.g., brightness adjustment), and strategically placed dropout layers to reduce overfitting. Fine-tuning through selective unfreezing of higher layers further adapts the model to domain-specific MRI data. Experiments on a publicly available brain tumor MRI dataset achieved a classification accuracy of 96.5%, with consistently high precision and recall. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the RKIO-based framework in improving the robustness and accuracy of medical image analysis, paving the way for more reliable automated diagnostic systems in healthcare."

    "abstract": "Recently, Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval Systems (SBS/RSs) have emerged as a cornerstone of modern robotic handling systems. However, motion conflicts between four-way shuttle vehicles are introduced frequently due to the sparsely connected roadmap topology. Furthermore, the different time and energy costs between linear and direction-changing motions bring additional difficulties for classic solvers when applied directly. To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Graph-Driven A* (DGA*) for cooperative path planning in SBS/RSs. By fully exploiting the structured topology of SBS/RS roadmaps, the algorithm extracts sector-level topological graphs enriched with spatiotemporal attributes, effectively resolving conflicts while simultaneously optimizing motion costs. In addition, Recursive Preemption and Avoidance (RPA) is introduced to ensure motion coordination in congestion-prone areas commonly seen in SBS/RSs, through a combination of independent avoidance and recursive avoidance mechanisms. We implement our approach in a real warehouse with more than 240 vehicles and achieve a 17% improvement in system throughput while reducing runtime."

    "abstract": "Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Network (STIN), with its wider coverage and more flexible network structure over its counterparts, is a crucial application scenario for the Sixth Generation (6G) mobile communications. However, the depolyment of network infrastructure and verification of related technologies are challenging. Therefore, a novel test framework is urgently needed to advance research outputs on STINs. Motivated by the recent proliferation of Digital Twin (DT) technology, the DT empowered STIN platform has been considered as a key enabling technology for the future 6G-based Internet of Everything (IoE). Nevertheless, there is still a lack of effective cases of applying DT technology in STINs. In this work, we discuss the importance of DT technology for the research and development of STINs. The prototype of the Multilayer Modular Architecture (MMA) for the DT in STIN is proposed. Through a hierarchical and modular design, the model is made more versatile and extensible. Meanwhile, aiming at the difficulties in multiple access caused by the high dynamics and large-scale delays in STINs, we propose a lightweight multiple-access protocol and take it as an application case of MMA. Furthermore, the test platform and the deployment scheme that we suggest are presented. Finally, the test results show that MMA can correctly verify the working logic of the proposed protocol in STIN, which provides an important reference for future research in IoE technology."

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion widely uses convolutional layers to capture local correlations and adjust feature dimensions. However, the progressive expansion of the receptive field in convolutional layers often compromises spatial context retention, leading to the loss of fine details. Furthermore, the fixed-size kernels typically used in standard convolution restrict the network’s ability to capture multiscale contextual details. To address this limitation, this paper develops a dilated transformation-guided unsupervised multimodal learning (DTUML) method to fuse a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI), thereby generating a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Our DTUML adopts a dual-stream encoder architecture to conduct multimodal data, where one stream focuses on preserving spectral information from LR-HSIs, while the other emphasizes the acquisition of spatial details from HR-MSIs. These complementary features are subsequently integrated to ensure spectral fidelity and retain spatial detail. Then, a convolutional layer restores dimensional consistency and outputs an HR-HSI. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DTUML, showing superior performance and strong competitiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a fully automated, online gain-selection algorithm executed directly on the drive’s microcontroller using a genetic algorithm. The method utilizes a versatile fitness function based on pole placement of a linearized estimator model. To ensure safe deployment, an on-target verification stage has been employed that validates the candidate gains for stability and adequate dynamic performance across a wide range of rotor speed prior to deployment in the target control system. The approach is generic to observers for which a linearized dynamic representation can be obtained, and its feasibility is demonstrated on two representative cases: a simple flux observer and a higher-order extended speed observer, confirming scalability under resource constraints typical of production microcontrollers. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves reliable gain selection on embedded hardware without external computing infrastructure."

With the help of system transformation technology, the convergence time and constrained boundaries are combined into common system variables of a newly unconstrained system, whose stabilization indicates that the effect of prescribed time control can be achieved, and all states remain within the constraint range. The designed neuroadaptive controller has the following three features: (1) The convergence time and tracking accuracy of the system error can be flexibly selected, and the initial error of the system does not need to be kept within the pre-set boundary range; (2) It introduces a unified constraint transformation method capable of handling both performance-related soft constraints and safety-critical hard constraints for prescribed-time tracking; (3) A polynomial-based envelope function is integrated into the play operator of the modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, thereby enhancing its capability to accurately characterize asymmetric hysteresis nonlinearities. The effectiveness of this method is verified through a piezoelectric positioning system."

Therefore, it is crucial for effective botnet traffic detection to discover and identify new emerging threat. Although recent deep learning-based methods performed well at classifying known botnet traffic but failed to handle unseen threats. This deficiency enables novel botnets to remain undetected, evade existing defenses, and inflict severe damage in real-world scenarios. To address these gaps, we propose a unified framework, Botnet Novel-class Classification (BoNC), which multi-classifies unlabelled encrypted botnet traffic by leveraging known classes to establish decision boundaries for previously unseen ones. We evaluate BoNC on three public encrypted traffic datasets with diverse labelled and unlabelled ratio configurations. BoNC consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods and accurately classifies known botnets and discovers unseen botnet variants in open-world scenarios."

In particular, this work employs an internal-resonating MEMS resonator that generates acoustic frequency combs. The spacing of these combs is dynamically modulated by a primary driving signal and an auxiliary signal that carries the phase-encoded information. The discrete variations in comb spacing serve as the demodulation metric, enabling accurate retrieval of the original phase-encoded data. This approach offers a feedforward demodulation structure, which obviates the need for phase-locked loops and mitigates potential I/Q mismatch issues. Through slightly tailored actuation configurations, both simulations and experiments present successful demodulations of binary and quadrature phase-shifted signals. This work presents a promising alternative to transistor-based demodulation systems and marks a significant step toward MEMS-based radio frequency front-ends."

The results showed that MVD-score was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with invasive breast cancer. By analyzing the clinical model (combined clinical independent factors), MVD model and nomogram model (combined MVD-score with clinical independent factors), we found that MVD model could achieve better prognostic predictive effects than each individual clinical independent prognostic factor, and achieve a prognostic value similar to that of the clinical model.

Each follower robot optimizes its local control inputs based on predicted trajectories of its neighbors within a directed communication graph, enabling decentralized execution. A unified cost function is formulated to balance formation maintenance, trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and control effort. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining the desired formation while avoiding successfully obstacles along the zigzag path.

By distributing the seven physical qubits needed for a logical qubit based on CSS, each QPU can accommodate more logical qubits compared to conventional (non-distributed) cases where all the physical qubits of a logical qubit are confined to a single QPU. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated in terms of its ability to detect X-errors, Z-errors, and Y-errors through stabilizer generators."

The antenna is loaded with semicircular and hexagonal slots on the top of the patch and a rectangular slot on the bottom of the radiating ground plane to achieve the dual-band performance.

Moreover, the proposed antenna produces steady and suitable radiation patterns across both operating frequencies.

In this work, we introduce Entanglement Ejection—a protocol for generating physical—logical entanglement from a single logical qubit. This subroutine establishes logical—logical entanglement via entanglement swapping with a physical Bell pair provided by a quantum network. Unlike common injection-based methods, our protocol is deterministic, requiring no post-selection and thereby has the potential of reducing spatio-temporal resource overhead. We show via numerical simulations under a superconducting-specific noise model that this potential resource efficiency comes at the cost of a slightly higher, yet comparable, logical error rate."

    "abstract": "With advent of Quantum Computing, traditional cyber security mechanisms are failing. This paper discusses the effectiveness of certain machine learning models in detecting such quantum attacks on quantum systems. The dataset used is custom generated using qiskit and AerSimulator and it focuses on three states of system, normal state, side-channel attack state and intercept-resend attack state. Machine learning models like logistic regression, neural networks, SVM and XGBoost were trained on the dataset. The highest accuracy observed was 0.81 obtained using XGBoost. These findings highlight the challenges of quantum attack detection and suggest future research directions for improving classification accuracy."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in most parts of the world and there is a need to find accurate and early diagnosis of this disease. Manual techniques of analysis on ECG might be time-consuming and susceptible to errors, which makes the application of deep learning (DL) techniques in automating HD classification and prediction possible. This study aims to evaluate how well various DL models such as CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, and ConvLSTM perform in categorising and forecasting cardiac illness using ECG signals.. CNN has the capability to capture spatial correlations, LSTM can perform on temporal sequences, CNN+LSTM can inherit the former two features, ConvLSTM is capable of adding convolutional operations to LSTM cells to improve feature representation and overcome the problem of gradient vanishing. A high accuracy of the models when tested on the created models on labeled ECG datasets was measured using parameters (indicators): accuracy, specificity, recall, false positive rate (FPR) and true negative rate (TNR). Quantitative results show that ConvLSTM showed the best performance with 95.6 accuracy, 98.7 specificity, 96.4 recall, 0.5 FPR and 0.90 TNR, whereas CNN+LSTM too performed well with 94.5 accuracy, 98.0 specificity. The paper finds that hybrid DL architectures, especially the ConvLSTM architecture, achieve robustness, reliability and precision of automated diagnosis of heart disease based on ECG, which is a potential clinical support tool at its early stages of detection."

The system used temperature, humidity and precipitation as the main items for predicting diseases. Ensembling by means of soft voting was used to increase performance, so the predictions of both classifiers were used together. As a result of using this approach, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score were all enhanced. Hybrid models were better than single classifiers in many cases such as for respiratory and water-borne illnesses whose symptoms can change with weather. Testing on held-out samples showed that the model was strong enough to generalize its findings. Moreover, because the model is computationally efficient, it is a good fit for health surveillance systems used in practice. The outcomes point out that machine learning is useful for public health forecasting because it offers a flexible warning system for both predicting diseases and recognizing their early signs."

It enables the identification of failure mechanisms, thereby facilitating the improvement of manufacturing processes and the enhancement of product yield. In this paper, the failure analysis of transistors under various gate voltage biases is conducted. By using a Nanoprober to apply different gate voltages, two types of transistor gate failure samples are induced. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) inspection is carried out on these samples to identify the defect mechanisms of the gate electrode under different voltages. The first type of failure shows performance degradation in threshold voltage (VT) and on-state current, which is attributed to the pre-existing defects in the HfO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> layer and stress-induced transition in the metal gate.

This study provides an alternative method for analyzing the failure mechanism and enhances the understanding of the device reliability of HKMG FinFET devices."

Each TSP is then further cut via Circuit-Level Decomposition, enabling execution on near-term quantum devices. Our approach achieves up to 95% reductions in the circuit depth, 96% reduction in the number of qubits and a 99.5% reduction in the number of 2-qubit gates. We demonstrate this hybrid algorithm on the standard edge encoding of the VRP as well as a novel amplitude encoding. These results demonstrate the feasibility of solving VRPs previously too complex for quantum simulators and provide early evidence of potential quantum utility."

    "abstract": "The increasing worldwide menace of plant diseases, causing, inter alia, annual losses of $3B due to coffee leaf rust, calls for the deployment of high-tech predictive tools above traditional reactive measures. Existing Systems relies upon manual scouting or analysis based on past weather information and incidents within the vicinity of a plantation, or basic machine learning methods (e.g., random forests) applied to segregated data sets, which results in suboptimal accuracy (60-70%) and fairly late detection (⩽7 days preceding visible symptoms). The thrust of this work goes to proposing Innovative Method a spatiotemporal digital twin integrating a hybrid ConvLSTM-Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 14 days pre-symptom disease prediction. The framework fuses multi-modal data, such as satellite NDVI (10m resolution Sentinel-2), drone thermal imagery (0.5 cm/pixel), IoT soil sensors (pH/moisture 15 min interval), and ERA5 microclimate forecasts into a physics-informed deep learning architecture. The ConvLSTM models temporal dynamics of canopy health, whereas the GNN models pathogen spread across the plants represented by graphs using graph attention (GAT) layers. Next, intervention strategies from the digital twin simulation layer built in Unity3D are tested with reinforcement learning (PPO algorithm). Validated with the 50 Colombian coffee farms dataset from 2021 to 2023, this system has obtained early rust detection with 88.3% precision (14.2 days of average lead time), with optimized treatment plans allowing a 34.7% reduction in pesticide usage, and increasing yields by 16.1% versus control groups. The model was 22.8% ahead of existing systems in F1-score and demonstrated generalizability to wheat rust in synthetic trials. This demonstration established that operational digital twins in hybrid deep learning architectures can bring crop protection from reactive to the predictive stage, hence working towards the sustainable agricultural goals set by FAO for 2030. Future directions may include edge AI deployment via NVIDIA Jetson with alerts in the field and prescription tracking via blockchain."

While issues like climate change, inequality, and limited resources call for changes in how engineers are trained, current programmes mostly focus on technical skills and often overlook important areas like systems thinking, ethics, and sustainability. The paper examines the barriers that make it hard to include SDGs in engineering education, such as strict curricula, a lack of faculty expertise, and little interdisciplinary work. It also highlights positive factors like increased student interest in meaningful education, access to open learning materials, and chances for international cooperation. To close the gap, the study suggests a framework based on three key areas: integrating SDGs into the curriculum, hands-on learning, and strong institutional support. This approach aims to connect education with global development needs, promote ethical responsibility, and improve practical problem-solving skills. In the end, the study calls for a major change to train engineers who are globally aware and focused on sustainability."

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization is one of the promising applications of quantum computation. Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) is a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm framework for noisy quantum devices. However, the quality of the solution is readily affected by statistical fluctuations and physical noise, making it challenging to maintain applicability for largescale problems. In contrast, sampling-based quantum algorithms have recently been successfully applied to large-scale quantum chemistry problems. In the sampling-based framework, the quantum device is used only for sampling, while the ground state and its energy are estimated on the classical device. In this study, we propose the Sampling-based Quantum Optimization Algorithm (SQOA) that leverages these advantages for combinatorial optimization. There are two challenges in constructing SQOA. The first challenge is that we need to encode the optimization problem in a non-diagonal Hamiltonian, even though many VQAs encode it into the Ising Hamiltonian, which is diagonal. The second challenge is that we need a method for efficient preparation of the input state to be sampled. To address the first challenge, we utilize the Quantum Relaxation (QR) method for encoding an optimization problem within a Hamiltonian. This method achieves a higher encoding density by mapping multiple variables to a single qubit, thus requiring fewer qubits for larger problems compared to the Ising Hamiltonian approach. Moreover, to address the second challenge, we investigate the parameter transferability within the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for QR Hamiltonians. We show that restricting parameters to a linear form exhibits moderate transferability for 3-regular Max-Cut problems, similar to transferability observed in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Therefore, this property allows us to efficiently prepare the input state for a large problem instance using the parameters obtained from a small problem instance. We leveraged transferability to create input states and applied SQOA with QR to the Max-Cut instances. By transferring parameters from a 20-node problem, we demonstrate that SQOA with QR provides high-quality solutions for 40-node problems without variational parameter optimization."

    "abstract": "Improving disease diagnosis requires accurate and early brain tumor detection from MRI scans. Centralized deep learning algorithms employed raise data privacy, variation in imaging modalities among institutions, and communication overhead in large-scale deployments. This paper proposes a Fed-Adapter, a parameter-efficient federated learning architecture that uses PEFT with adapter modules for decentralized brain tumor detection, that addresses these issues. The proposed Fed-Adapter uses lightweight adapter layers on a fixed MobileNetV2 backbone to train and send a few parameters during the federated updates. This design saves computational and communication costs without compromising the model accuracy. This work uses FedProx to stabilize local updates using a proximal regularization term to reduce effects of non IID data distribution across clients. The proposed framework was tested using a publicly accessible Brain Tumor MRI dataset and achieved 97% classification accuracy, which is comparable to that of a fully centralized MobileNetV2 model. It preserves patient privacy and enables multi-institutional collaboration. Grad-CAM-based visualization improved tumor localization. According to extensive studies, Fed-Adapter outperforms typical federated learning baselines in terms of prediction performance and communication efficiency. PEFT, adapter modules and FedProx in a federated setup provide a privacy-preserving, resource-efficient, and clinically interpretable brain tumor diagnosis solution using MRI data."

Various initiatives are emerging across the continent aimed at enhancing understanding and interest in quantum education. As global interest in quantum technologies grows, Africa is at a pivotal juncture, with the opportunity to cultivate a new generation of quantum leaders and innovators. This work examines how various emerging quantum science and technology programs, existing collaborations, research initiatives, and grassroots movements can enhance the continent's quantum education ecosystem, spotlighting emerging innovative models and the Africa Quantum Consortium's potential for coordinated growth. While Africa has made significant progress, significant challenges remain, including limited funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of trained educators in quantum sciences. Despite these challenges, quantum education in Africa is beginning to take shape, driven by a growing awareness among students and educators that quantum concepts are essential to understanding the modern scientific world. Quantum education in Africa is important for Africa and the rest of the world. In particular, it fosters a new generation of skilled scientists and engineers capable of tackling complex challenges and driving innovation in diverse fields. This will lead to advances in various technologies, benefiting both Africa and the global community. In addition, focusing on innovative models and collaborative frameworks will help close the technological gap between Africa and developed nations, encouraging economic growth and improved living standards. Ultimately, this work advocates for a holistic approach that integrates academic resources, industry partnerships, and policy support to build a robust quantum ecosystem across the continent. Given the limitations imposed by the format of this work and the pace in which quantum science is advancing, it is not feasible to acknowledge all contributors or to present a comprehensive overview of the most recent quantum science and technology advancements in Africa. As such, we recommend that readers consult the cited works and related references for further insights. Most significantly, through these highlighted efforts and developments, Africa can position itself as a significant player in the global quantum science and technology landscape, driving both technological advancement and socio-economic development."

As the market and society demand a greater number of engineers, attracting and retaining more female talent in engineering has become a global challenge to avoid losing talent. In this context, the Fundación Universitaria Tecnológico Comfenalco in Colombia initiated a project to gain a broader perspective on the problem and potential solutions, taking into account the current participation of females in engineering studies in Colombia, as well as in other countries, such as Ghana and Spain. The project started with a study profiling current female engineering students aimed at identifying significant differences between the three countries. A trip to Spain was organised to learn about the approaches employed by the Women and Technology Chair at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and the Chair for the Promotion of Women in STEM Vocational Training for Sustainable Mobility (STEM Women Chair) at Universidad Pontificia Comillas. This paper introduces the visit to Madrid of a group of female students and academics of diverse engineering degrees from two universities in Colombia, Fundación Universitaria Tecnologico Comfenalco in Cartagena and Institución Universitaria Salazar y Herrera in Medellin, and the Kumasi University of Ghana of Ghana. During the visits, participants learned about the activities carried out in Spain and also visited leading companies in various engineering sectors. The impact of the visit was assessed through questionnaires and video testimonies. Results show that it was a motivating experience for all participants. The visiting academics were exposed to strategies for promoting STEM studies that could inspire future programs. Visiting students learnt about innovative and multidisciplinary engineering projects and possible career opportunities, such as research, that they had not considered before. For Spanish academics, participating in the project allowed them to learn about the situation of women in engineering in countries such as Colombia and Ghana, as well as the problems they face. Spanish students could meet students from other countries whose life circumstances differ, allowing them to appreciate their situation better and become more empathetic about other cultures."

This paper introduces the square root reproducing kernel Hilbert space extended Kalman filter (SRREKF) as a novel approach for robust and adaptive state estimation. By leveraging an online expectationmaximization algorithm together with square root factors, the SRREKF not only learns unknown system parameters and approximates nonlinear dynamics and measurements, through kernel-based function representations, but also contributes to preventing the covariance matrices to lose their positivedefiniteness. This framework enables accurate and stable threat detection and active sensing, offering a promising approach for resilient spacecraft navigation under uncertain conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SRREKF with online EM significantly outperforms the standard EKF in terms of estimation accuracy, particularly under nonlinear and noisy measurement conditions."

This work examines the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity.

An effective onboard filter must be accurate, consistent, efficient, and verifiable. Recent work has shown that the Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF) is an accurate and consistent nonlinear filter capable of handling non-Gaussian probability distributions. However, its fixed number of Gaussian components restricts efficiency, and its random resampling step prevents verifiability. To address these issues, the EnGMF is refined such that it adaptively reduces the number of Gaussian components, and it deterministically resamples using Fibonacci grids with optimal reduction. The presented cislunar scenario relies solely on noisy azimuth and elevation angle measurements obtained from vision-based sensors (e.g., cameras), demonstrating both the need for nonlinear filtering and its potential for deepspace operations. Simulation results indicate that the refined EnGMF approaches maintain the accuracy and consistency of the traditional EnGMF, and also improve its efficiency and ensure verifiability."

In this work, we introduce a hybrid-erasure architecture for surface code error correction where a carefully chosen subset of qubits is designated as erasure qubits while the rest remain standard. Through code-capacity analysis and circuitlevel simulations, we show that a hybrid-erasure architecture can boost the performance of the surface code-much like how a game of Minesweeper becomes easier once a few squares are revealed-while using fewer resources than a full-erasure architecture. We study strategies for the allocation and placement of erasure qubits through analysis and simulations. We then use the hybrid-erasure architecture to explore the trade-offs between per-qubit cost and key logical performance metrics such as threshold and effective distance in surface code error correction. Our results show that the strategic introduction of dual-rail erasure qubits in a transmon architecture can enhance the logical performance of surface codes for a fixed transmon budget, particularly for near-term-relevant transmon counts and logical error rates."

    "abstract": "Stock market prediction is a complex task due to market volatility, global crises, and political factors. Traditional methods, such as technical and fundamental analysis, often fail to capture non-linear patterns. With advancements in machine learning, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have become effective for time series forecasting, learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. This research employs LSTM networks to predict stock price trends using five years of structured historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, including features like closing price, trading volume, and moving averages. Preprocessing techniques such as data normalization, missing value handling, and outlier removal were applied to enhance data quality. The model’s performance, evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and MAE, was compared against traditional methods like ARIMA and simple RNNs, demonstrating LSTM’s superior accuracy. Experiments with different architectures, such as stacked and bidirectional LSTM, were conducted to optimize performance. Results highlight LSTM’s ability to model complex price movements, providing valuable insights for investors. This study underscores the potential of deep learning in financial forecasting, contributing to the advancement of predictive analytics in financial markets."

    "abstract": "In this paper, two analysis techniques of XPS and TOF-SIMS will be jointly applied to analyze the composition of residual contamination elements after the aluminum (Al) surface cleaning process of automotive parts, especially for quantitative analysis of trace elements boron (B) and phosphorus (P). TOF-SIMS will be used for confirming the existence of the trace element B and P to ensure and improve the accuracy. XPS is often used to quantitatively analyze trace elements, but for some elements with complex peak positions, it is confusing and challenging to accurately determine the elements. By using TOF-SIMS for confirmation, XPS’ misjudgment of trace elements can be avoided, thereby obtaining more accurate XPS quantitative analysis results. It is known that TOF-SIMS has better sensitivity than XPS. But its quantitative analysis is not as good as that of XPS. The combination of the two techniques makes full use of their respective advantages, not only to avoid missing elements detected by XPS, but also to obtain more accurate XPS quantitative analysis results. In this paper, we will use both XPS and TOF-SIMS methods to accurately and quantitatively analyze B and P trace elements after the Al surface cleaning process of automotive parts."

In the encoder stage, sequential Swin Transformer blocks capture global contextual features, while the DP-HSAN module in the decoder enhances spatial features during upsampling. The adaptive transformer-triggered pathway bridges the semantic gap between encoder and decoder outputs.

Due to the inherent errors of heading sensors, the fitting values of remote array elements will deviate greatly from the true values under the iterative accumulation of errors. In addition, the selection of fitting order can also cause various problems. Fitting only uses the current value, which is insufficient for data utilization. Therefore, this paper improves the above conventional methods by introducing adaptive ideas into formation estimation and applying forgetting factors to historical data, fully utilizing the information of data. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified using actual data, which can be well applied to engineering. Among them."

To facilitate performance improvement and efficiency analysis, we employ several optimization strategies, including gradient clipping, weight decay, early stopping, hyperparameter configuration, and mixed-precision training. To further enable use in realistic contexts, personality scores are converted into narrative, descriptive summaries. In terms of the relative performance of RoBERTa and ALBERT, results show that ALBERT outperforms RoBERTa, based on all key evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score.

The converter is first described through an averaged state-space model, which is reformulated as a port-Hamiltonian (pH) structure to facilitate energy-based control design. A PI-PBC law is proposed using component-wise error signals, and its stability is rigorously demonstrated via Lyapunov analysis. To improve dynamic performance across varying operating points, a gain-scheduling formulation is introduced, allowing the control gains to adapt as functions of the desired equilibrium state. The simulation results confirm that the proposed PI-PBC strategy provides accurate voltage regulation and fast transient response while ensuring continuous conduction. The controller exhibits robustness under reference changes and load disturbances, and the gain-scheduled designs outperform constant-gain implementations in terms of overshoot reduction and settling time."

This paper examines these challenges and outlines a structured emergency patching framework, including vulnerability assessment, risk-based prioritization, controlled deployment, and rollback planning. Additionally, it introduces the Emergency Patching Management System (EPMS) as a strategic approach to streamline patching while minimizing operational risks.

Personalized FL (PFL) enhances traditional FL by tailoring models to the needs of each participant and improving local inference performance. Given the resource constraints and potential for edge node failures, optimized inference task rescheduling mechanisms play a crucial role in ensuring resilience in inference services. Existing methods often ignore the impact of the inherent model differences on inferential tasks leading to suboptimal personalization in EC. To address this challenge, we propose a framework, SOIR, which effectively integrates model similarity into the rescheduling process. The inference task rescheduling problem in EC is formulated with a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model, and an efficient algorithm is introduced to solve it. Our experimental results showcase the applicability and effectiveness of SOIR in FL-based resilient EC environments."

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has become a key enabler of scalable and high-performance applications, allowing systems to be deployed rapidly. At the same time, the increasing sophistication of cloud-native environments brings new challenges related to system dependability. Ensuring resilience under such conditions is a fundamental responsibility of IT providers, who must safeguard service continuity and operational stability. The widespread use of microservice-based designs has created an ecosystem with a growing number of interacting components, including frameworks, application layers, hypervisors, and orchestration platforms. This distributed and layered environment produces a massive volume of log data originating from heterogeneous sources. Without automated support, extracting useful insights from these logs becomes a highly complex task. One promising direction to mitigate this challenge is the use of Machine Learning, particularly methods grounded in Large Language Models (LLMs), which can dynamically detect recurring structures and anomalies in event streams. Building on this idea, our work introduces an anomaly detection framework deployed within a microservices environment running on Kubernetes with Istio. The framework integrates an LLM trained on a diverse set of fault scenarios. To create these scenarios, we relied on Chaos Mesh for fault injection and Locust for workload stress testing. The evaluation confirmed that the model achieved high accuracy in identifying anomalies. It consistently detected all injected faults, although a small number of false positives were observed. Importantly, these false alarms remained at acceptable levels, highlighting the approach’s practical applicability."

Nonetheless, optimizing edge computing resources in IoT-Cloud systems continues to be a formidable challenge. This research introduces a unique Dynamic Edge Computing Optimization (DECO) framework that utilizes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to enhance resource allocation in IoT-Cloud systems. The suggested PSODECO framework employs a fitness function that incorporates several objectives, such as latency, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Simulation results indicate that the PSODECO framework surpasses current optimization methods, realizing substantial decreases in latency (up to 30%) and energy consumption (up to $25 \\%$). The suggested framework provides an effective solution for optimizing edge computing resources in IoT-Cloud systems, facilitating real-time data processing and analytics for diverse IoT applications."

    "abstract": "Automatic pollen detection has recently gained significant research attention due to its importance for public health. Numerous computer vision methods have been proposed for this task, with the majority relying on two-stage object detection models applied to optical microscopy images. However, twostage approaches generally suffer from higher inference times, making them less suitable for real-time pollen monitoring tasks. Moreover, model performance on measurements from outdoor data samples remains largely unexplored because they introduce additional challenges, including visually complex backgrounds and the presence of other non-pollen particles such as dust, spores, and debris. In this work, we investigate the limits of the one-stage detection model YOLOv11 on Ambrosia pollen detection in images of outdoor and laboratory-prepared samples, acquired with the AeroTape device. We systematically evaluate training strategies, analyzing the effects of using either laboratory or outdoor images, their combinations, and also the use of data augmentation. The results show that incorporating augmented lab-prepared pollen images into training achieves the best mAP@50-95, highlighting the benefits of controlled laboratory data and one-stage detectors for improved generalization."

Despite the recognized benefits of CURE in promoting research skills, there is limited understanding of its impact on first-year students. The study involved 45 students who participated in three challenges during their first semester: Remote Operated Vehicles (ROV), Water-Powered Rockets (WPR), and Solar Water Heaters (SWH). These challenges required students to apply scientific knowledge to real-world problems and present their findings through research papers, presentations, and posters. The methodology included workshops on scientific article analysis, APA citation, literature reviews, research paper writing, and poster creation. The progress of students was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire and a rubric evaluating the quality of their research outputs. Results showed significant improvements in competencies: Additionally, around 90% of the students reported enhanced research skills. The findings suggest that integrating CURE into the freshman year curriculum is effective for developing key competencies and prepares students for future academic and professional challenges. Although limited by the single-semester timeframe, this study highlights the potential of CURE to improve research skills and provides a foundation for future research on its long-term impact."

The ten-week SL–STEAM project engaged students in designing and constructing mosquito trap lamps to support the well-being of boarding students at a local secondary school. Using a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design, the study compared an experimental group <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(n=24)$</tex> and a control group (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n=28$</tex>) through pre–post surveys and student reflections. Quantitative results showed substantial improvements in empathy and marginally significant gains in STEAM selfefficacy for the experimental group. Civic responsibility improved within both groups but showed no significant between-group difference. Qualitative findings reinforced these patterns, indicating positive development across all three domains. These results offer initial insights into the potential of SL–STEAM to support both academic and socio-emotional outcomes in lower secondary education, while also indicating that civic outcomes may require ongoing engagement to develop measurably. The study's limitations, including the small sample size, single-institution context, and short intervention duration, underscore the need for further research to examine the scalability and long-term impact of SL–STEAM approaches."

    "abstract": "Sustainable agriculture and maximum production of plants require fertilizers. Nevertheless, traditional agricultural systems do not focus enough on real-time soil fertility, crop type, and soil peculiarities, which is why the method is rather inefficient and this practice is harmful to the ecosystem. The current paper introduces a context-aware system tool which recommends fertilizer that incorporates the usage of Internet of Things (IoT) along with more sophisticated machine learning (ML) models. The architecture with NPK-based sensors managed by IoT monitors the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of soil on a real time basis. Such data, together with crop and soil type are transferred through RF-433 MHz modules into a cloud-based server where data processing takes place. Within the range of the supervised learning ML algorithms, four ones are checked regarding predictive accuracy: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The best training and test accuracy of 96 and 94 percent, respectively was attained by GNB. The usage of sensors showed good agreement with standard chemical testing and had small deviations (0.34 N, 0.36 P, -0.13 K) proving the validity of the sensor system. The suggested solution is cost-effective, scalable and applicable in remote uses and it facilitates real-time, site-specific and environmentally sustainable fertilizer decisions."

    "abstract": "We present a quantum cognitive model that can be implemented on a quantum machine. This model uses solutions of the Schrödinger equation to model human cognitive control and decision making in a standard paradigm in psychology: the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task, where participants are forced to choose between two competing alternatives. In the model, the two alternatives map to a multiple square well potential energy function. The depths of the wells correspond to attentional control, while the widths corresponds to features of the stimulus. Using this potential energy, the time-independent Schrodinger equation can be solved for an energy eigenstate basis of the bound states of the system, with higher energies corresponding to higher levels of focus. The full time-dependent Hamiltonian involves an oscillating field that evolves the system from ground state to superpositions of the excited states. The probabilities of the choices in the task are calculated as the probability of finding particles in a particular potential well. Furthermore, the quantum framing of this problem makes this problem suitable for mapping to quantum computing implementations. The state of the system follows the trajectory of a ground state, which can be mapped to a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) implementation. Meanwhile, the time-dependency and oscillating field can be simulated using current quantum simulation methods and Rabi oscillations. Since our problems can be mapped onto currently-available NISQ prototypes of 2040 qubits, they represent an application domain with tractable near-term quantum-computing resource requirements."

Accurate posture prediction and assessment during physiotherapy sessions are vital for tracking recovery and guiding therapeutic interventions. In this study, proposed StrokePoseNet(SPN) a novel temporal-spatial deep learning architecture designed to predict and classify rehabilitation postures based on joint coordinate sequences. Our approach combines 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from individual frames and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies across sequences. Utilized the publicly available Toronto Rehabilitation Stroke Pose Dataset, which includes posture sequences of stroke patients performing various rehabilitation exercises. SPN was trained and evaluated using standard machine learning metrics, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.42% and a balanced F1-score of 95.99%. Comparative analysis with baseline models such as Random Forest, SVM, and standalone CNN or LSTM architectures confirmed StrokePoseNet’s superior performance. The outcomes reinforce that the model can be implemented in real-time scenarios in the clinical setting, proposing a data-based method to monitor stroke treatment through the form of intelligent physiotherapy frameworks."

However, the large data centres where cloud computing services are hosted consume significant amounts of electricity annually due to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) components. This issue is exacerbated by the increasing deployment of large artificial intelligence (AI) models, which often rely on distributed data centres, thereby significantly impacting the global environment. This study proposes the COUNTER model, designed for sustainable cloud resource management. COUNTER is integrated with cluster graph neural networks and evaluated in a simulated cloud environment, aiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining quality of service parameters. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in resource utilisation, energy consumption, and cost effectiveness compared to the baseline model, HUNTER, which employs a gated graph neural network aimed at achieving carbon neutrality in cloud computing for modern ICT systems."

This study presents a case study of the Biotechnology Engineering program in a Mexican university and the various efforts implemented to foster the graduates' employability, where the university-industry partnerships played a significant role. The study describes the universityindustry partnerships and elements of our educational model, such as challenges where students and faculty are immersed with industry as academic partners in a challenge-based learning environment, and industrial placements as formative experiences. The employability of biotechnology engineering graduates of the last three semesters was analyzed to observe the effects of these efforts. Students, faculty, and industry addressed real-world challenges faced by the companies, providing students with formative and hands-on experiences. These opportunities enabled students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired in their academic program to practical industry contexts. These experiences helped students better understand the professional landscape and their career interests while becoming familiar with potential employers seeking new talent. Industry, in turn, benefited from fresh perspectives and innovative proposals generated by students, gaining insight into their capabilities and identifying potential talent. As a result, employability indicators for the Biotechnology Engineering program showed a relevant improvement. Challenge-based learning bridges academic training and industry needs. University-industry partnerships proved mutually beneficial, helping students develop competency and workforce readiness while providing companies with fresh ideas and access to emerging talent."

    "abstract": "This article presents an advanced packaging architecture for conformal wideband antennas intended for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with specific emphasis on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity and radar cross-section (RCS) reduction. The proposed design employs a cavity-embedded Vivaldi antenna, where conformal behavior is achieved through a curvature-matched machined cylindrical cavity and Rohacell support. The antenna is engineered to operate across 2-18 GHz, providing wideband coverage suitable for multi-functional UAV communication and sensing. The packaged structure enhances the realized gain (5-12 dBi across the band) and achieves a significant RCS reduction down to –18 dBsm, facilitating improved survivability and reduced detectability in radar-monitored environments. Fabricated on a RO4350B substrate, the antenna maintains a compact footprint of 0.45λ₀ × 0.34λ₀ × 0.0016λ₀ at 2 GHz and is optimized for aerodynamic compatibility with UAV fuselage contours. Comprehensive full-wave simulations and measurements validate the performance of the integrated antenna–cavity assembly in terms of impedance bandwidth, radiation characteristics, and scattering behavior. The presented packaging approach demonstrates a robust pathway for UAV-centric wideband antenna integration, offering improved radiation stability, reduced signature, and compatibility with next-generation V2X communication systems."

Based on this, three reinforcement distribution solutions were designed and prepared for the study (A: monolayer carbon fiber +silicon carbide. B: 0°/90° staggered carbon fiber +silicon carbide. C: gradient silicon carbide content 0-20 wt. %). In this study, the mechanical, thermal, abrasion, and impact resistance properties were systematically tested using vacuum assisted resin infusion molding process. Test results indicated that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of Solution C-20% were 12.60% and 12.84% higher than those of the baseline Solution A, respectively. The flexural strength increased by 29.00%, and the compressive strength increased by 31.40%.

    "abstract": "Truth discovery has emerged as an effective tool to mitigate data inconsistency in crowdsensing by prioritizing data from high-quality responders. While local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a crucial privacy-preserving paradigm, existing studies under LDP rarely explore a worker's participation in specific tasks for sparse scenarios, which may also reveal sensitive information such as individual preferences and behaviors. Existing LDP mechanisms, when applied to truth discovery in sparse settings, may create undesirable dense distributions, provide insufficient privacy protection, and introduce excessive noise, compromising the efficacy of subsequent non-private truth discovery. Additionally, the interplay between noise injection and truth discovery remains insufficiently explored in the current literature. To address these issues, we propose a lOcally differentially private truth diSCovery approach for spArse cRowdsensing, namely OSCAR. The main idea is to use advanced optimization techniques to reconstruct the sparse data distribution and re-formalize truth discovery by considering the statistical characteristics of injected Laplacian noise while protecting the privacy of both the tasks being completed and the corresponding sensory data. Specifically, to address the data density concerns while alleviating noise, we design a randomized response based Bernoulli matrix factorization method BerRR. To recover the sparse structures from densified, perturbed data, we formalize a 0-1 integer programming problem and develop a sparse recovery solving method SpaIE based on implicit enumeration. We further devise a Laplacian-sensitive truth discovery method LapCRH that leverages maximum likelihood estimation to re-formalize truth discovery by measuring differences between noisy values and truths based on the statistical characteristic of Laplacian noise. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis establishes OSCAR's privacy guarantees, utility bounds, and computational complexity. Experimental results show that OSCAR surpasses the state-of-the-arts by at least 30% in accuracy improvement."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of wearable devices and intelligent sensing technologies, the demand for human behavior recognition in rehabilitation medicine and human-machine collaboration has been increasing. To address the issue of high variability in gait features caused by individual differences in cross-population gait analysis, and to tackle the insufficient generalization ability of models due to the coupling of pathological features with normal gait, we propose a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal feature-guided SG-LSTM framework, based on a dual-branch architecture comprising symmetric LSTM (S-LSTM) and grouped LSTM (G-LSTM) networks, for cross-population lower-limb activity recognition and prediction. On the one hand, the S-LSTM module with a symmetric input structure is used to explicitly model the spatiotemporal symmetry of lower-limb joints in normal gait. On the other hand, the G-LSTM module with a joint functional grouping strategy and local motion decoupling is employed to explicitly model the abnormal motion coupling of lower-limb joints in pathological gait. Furthermore, a dynamically weighted multi-task loss function is designed to jointly optimize gait trajectory prediction and classification tasks, allowing the framework to simultaneously produce both outputs and enhance the adaptability of the model. Extensive experiments on our self-constructed gait dataset as well as the HuGaDB and WearGait-PD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms several existing approaches in cross-population human behavior prediction and gait recognition, but also holds potential clinical application value, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance."

Inspired by the remarkable synergy between quantum mechanics and biological spiking neurons, we present a novel QSNN architecture that leverages QLIF to tackle complex AI tasks. Leveraging entanglement, the quantum variant of SNNs acts as a game-changer, offering faster computation, enhanced accuracy. QLIF Spiking Neurons provide a powerful solution to scalability issues, advancing the potential of AI and quantum technologies in neural networks and complex problem-solving across industries and science. Our approach presents the QLIF model, where neurons integrate incoming signals and fire upon a threshold crossing, creating spikes that interact with quantum circuits to form a quantum-spiking neural network. Our work aims to: (i) enhance computational time and (ii) enrich the learning capabilities of the training model. Our results highlight that QSNN not only accelerates training but also improves accuracy, particularly in deeper quantum circuits. This demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating spiking neural dynamics into quantum models, paving the way for more efficient and biologically inspired quantum learning systems. The proposed approach holds promise for future applications in neuromorphic quantum computing and real-time edge intelligence."

Regression models explore the Budget Sentiment Score with conventional indicators such as GDP growth, inflation, trade balance, and population. Model comparison with and without sentiment scores, the research finds that actual economic measures far exceed policy announcements in explaining FDI inflows. GDP per capita exhibits a high positive correlation with FDI inflows ($=15.74$, p $(\\lt)0.01$), whereas GDP growth is negatively correlated ($=-3.66$, p $(\\lt)0.01$). The sentiment score, while being positively correlated with FDI inflows $(r=0.604)$, failed to significantly enhance the explanatory power of the model ($=-2.27, \\mathrm{p}\\gt0.05$).

    "abstract": "The emergence of huge-scale, data-intensive linear optimization (LO) problems in applications such as machine learning has driven the need for more computationally efficient interior point methods (IPMs). While conventional IPMs are polynomial-time algorithms with rapid convergence, their periteration cost can be prohibitively high for dense large-scale LO problems. Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine. Additionally, all matrix-vector products are performed on the quantum hardware. This hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves an optimal worst-case scaling of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2}\\right)$</tex> for fully dense LO problems. To ensure high precision, despite the limited accuracy of quantum operations, we incorporate iterative refinement techniques both within and outside the proposed IPM iterations.

We apply foundation models to large-scale telco drive test data, achieving up to $30 \\%$ relative gain in $R^{2}$ over state-of-the-art methods like XGBoost. A central focus is transforming numeric telco data into tokens, enabling meaningful embeddings. Unlike NLP and computer vision, the telco domain lacks pretrained models, necessitating training from scratch to capture domain-specific patterns. We also detail data preprocessing and sequence conversion techniques tailored for foundation models, as well as the trade-offs of various numeric binning methods (e.g., cut, qcut, Lloyd-Max quantization) affecting data balance and token frequency. Beyond KPI prediction, we demonstrate the ability of the foundation model as a network optimization simulator, offering significant advantages over manual tuning. Our results show that foundation models excel on large datasets with millions of rows and high categorical complexity, consistently outperforming XGBoost, which remains more effective on simpler datasets. Furthermore, foundation models achieve up to $13 \\%$ relative gain in $R^{2}$ in public tabular datasets, underscoring their versatility for complex, high-dimensional data challenges."

The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PH-QFNO using PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation, incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PH-QFNO recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PH-QFNO achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts.

This process mimics human curiosity-driven learning, leading to more effective knowledge acquisition. Previous studies have demonstrated LBA’s success in structured, synthetic environments such as CLEVR, where questions follow predefined logical patterns. However, its applicability to real-world datasets, which contain more diverse and complex natural images, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend LBA to large-scale real-world datasets such as VQA v2 and GQA by integrating transformer-based question generation models, including GPT and T5, to produce semantically rich and contextually relevant questions. Additionally, we employ curriculum learning techniques to prioritize the selection of the most informative questions, optimizing the learning process. Through extensive experimentation, we assess LBA’s ability to generalize beyond synthetic settings, comparing its performance against traditional supervised learning approaches. Our findings suggest that LBA maintains its effectiveness in real-world scenarios by improving sample efficiency and enhancing model robustness. However, challenges remain in ensuring question diversity, mitigating biases, and addressing ambiguities in natural image datasets. Future work could further refine LBA by incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms and exploring open-world generalization techniques."

However, their heavy reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack, making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model. Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust, triggerindependent defenses for AI-assisted code generation."

    "abstract": "With the increasing volume of images, processing high-dimensional feature of image presents challenges, particularly due to the curse of dimensionality, which adversely affects the accuracy and speed of automatic image annotation algorithms. Consequently, extracting appropriate features is a critical challenge in this domain. Another significant issue is the scalability of algorithms; however, dimensionality reduction methods based on deep learning can effectively address this problem. In this paper, we employ a feature extraction method using sparse autoencoders to tackle these challenges. This approach reduces high-dimensional image feature vectors, mitigating the curse of dimensionality and consequently enhancing both the accuracy and speed of image annotation methods. For the image tagging phase, we utilized a modified version of the traditional 2PKNN method, a well-established search-based image annotation technique. The MIRFlicker dataset, consisting of social images, served as our data source. By evaluating common metrics such as precision, recall, F1-Score, and AUC against previously reported methods, we found that our approach achieved an F1-Score of $\\mathbf{1 6. 7} \\boldsymbol{\\pm} \\mathbf{1. 1}$, a Macro AUC of $14.4 \\pm 0.7$, and a Micro AUC increase of $6.9 \\pm 0.2$ compared to similar works. Furthermore, the sparse autoencoder-based feature extraction method reduced the execution time of the search-based algorithm by one third compared to traditional dimensionality reduction techniques."

This paper suggests two major enhancements to ProtoNets to address this issue: first is a memory module that stores and utilizes stable category representations from previous tasks, and second is a noiseaware gating mechanism that adapts the model's reliance on current prototypes and memory representations based on the current task's noise level. Studies in environments with varying levels of Gaussian noise demonstrate that incorporating the gating mechanism greatly enhances model accuracy.The complete model, which combines memory and gating mechanism, achieves optimal performance across multiple noise levels. GM-ProtoNet greatly improves accuracy while maintaining constant FLOPs and keeping inference latency under 4 ms, demonstrating an excellent lightweight design with practical deployment potential and minimal additional computational overhead."

Unlike general-purpose chatbots, task-based chatbots are software designed to prioritize the completion of tasks of the domain they handle (e.g., flight booking). Given the growing popularity of chatbots, testing techniques that can generate full conversations as test cases have emerged. Still, thoroughly testing all the possible conversational scenarios implemented by a taskbased chatbot is challenging, resulting in incorrect behaviors that may remain unnoticed. To address this challenge, we proposed Mutabot, a mutation testing approach for injecting faults in conversations and producing faulty chatbots that emulate defects that may affect the conversational aspects. In this paper, we present our extension of Mutabot to multiple platforms (Dialogflow and Rasa), and present experiments that show how mutation testing can be used to reveal weaknesses in test suites generated by the Botium state-of-the-art test generator."

With advancements in deep learning, chatbots are increasing in this modern world. Chatbots are automated conversational agents that allow humans to interact with machines naturally and intuitively. In the field of education, chatbots have the potential to transform teaching and learning by engaging students, tailoring learning experiences, assisting educators, and providing valuable insights into students' behaviours. Although various strategies have been developed for incorporating LLM-based chatbots into legal pedagogy, there remains a gap in research exploring the recent design techniques for chatbot-learner interactions within educational settings. Hence, this study presents a systematic review to understand, compare, and reflect on recent attempts to utilize LLM-based chatbots in education to enhance Legal pedagogy. At first, the described literature is presented for analyzing the general concept of the LLM. Further, the dataset description of conventional models is discussed in this work. For a better understanding, the advantages and disadvantages of the present models are analyzed and listed. In the end, the future gap and challenges are explained to develop an effective LLM-based chatbot for student learning and engagement. This study contains a systematic review of the existing body of knowledge, critically assesses the potential and limitations of LLM chatbots in legal pedagogy, and sets a direction for future inquiry and development in this field."

The improved Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) strategy combines GWO with the Slime Molding Algorithm (SMA) to determine the parameters of FOPID. The designed controller addresses the nonlinearities, ensuring system stability and accurate trajectory tracking. The cost function used for the optimization process is a combination of Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral Mean Square Error (ISE) to minimize the state deviation and enhance the response capability. The results are demonstrated through simulations on MATLAB-Simulink with different trajectory scenarios and compared with state-of-the-art optimization techniques such as PSO or GWO. The results show that the controller helps to improve the trajectory tracking ability, the cost function and the position error are improved compared to other optimization techniques."

A case study was conducted to investigate whether and how these human errorbased criteria manifest in real-world aviation industry projects. The study analyzed ten aviation-related software systems, with defect data collected by an independent third-party testing center during certification tests. The results indicate that violations of the proposed criteria in requirements specifications do, in fact, lead to corresponding errors during the design and coding phases.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of industrial systems. Currently, reconstruction-based methods rely on the powerful capability of deep learning models to extract temporal features, showing excellent performance in modeling normal patterns. However, they also tend to extract unnecessary anomalous features, leading to reconstruct of anomalies well. To address this issue, we propose a Transformer with Sinusoidal Prototype Guidance for Time Series Anomaly Detection (SPTAD). We introduce a sinusoidal prototype guidance module that uses structural priors of periodic subspaces to constrain the model to reconstruct within the normal pattern space by aggregating normal patterns based on prototype similarity. It enhances the model's representation capability in the latent space while avoiding interference from anomalous features. Moreover, SPTAD employs Transformer to capture long-term dependencies in time series, improving its ability to model global temporal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SPTAD achieves an average F1 score of 95.59%, significantly outperforming six baseline methods."

    "abstract": "In the fragmented operation and maintenance scenarios of electric power metering assets, the construction of metering boxes, the rotation of old equipment, marketing census, on-site inspections and inspections, etc., put forward very high requirements for image feature extraction technology. These scenarios not only have significant differences in work objectives, archiving needs to accurately record the details of the appearance of the equipment, inspection needs to quickly identify potential safety hazards, marketing census needs to balance the accuracy and efficiency, but also face the complexity of the field environment, uneven data distribution and other issues, resulting in the accuracy, efficiency and stability of image feature extraction is difficult to achieve synergistic optimization. Traditional fixed models such as Mask R-CNN can ensure a certain degree of accuracy, but the delay is too high in real-time scenarios; MobileNet-SSD is lightweight but cannot meet the demand for fine-grained feature extraction, and both of them have a significant decrease in stability under the interference of backlighting, motion blur, and so on. Aiming at this situation, this paper proposes an adaptive feature extraction framework of “Scene Sensing Dynamic Adaptation - Joint Optimization”. The framework realizes automatic scene identification through the “demand interference” two-dimensional quantitative model, adjusts the extraction strategy on demand based on the two-branch dynamic network, and combines meta-learning and transfer learning to complete cross-scene knowledge reuse and anti-interference optimization. The experimental results show that in the measurement box archiving scenario, the feature extraction accuracy of “one box with multiple signatures” reaches 95.3 %, which is 12.7 % higher than that of traditional Mask R-CNN; in the on-site inspection scenario, the inference time of a single image is reduced to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 9 m s}$</tex>, which is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 6. 2 \\%}$</tex> shorter than that of MobileNetSSD; and under different interference scenarios such as backlight and motion blur, the inference time of a single image is reduced to 89 ms, which is 46.2 % shorter than that of MobileNet-SSD. In different interference scenarios such as backlight and motion blur, the accuracy fluctuation is controlled within 4.8 %, which is significantly better than the fixed model. Meanwhile, in small sample scenarios (e.g., only 1,000 training images in the archiving scenario), the feature extraction accuracy of the framework reaches 91.2 %, which is close to the training effect of the traditional model with 5,000 samples, and significantly reduces the cost of data annotation. This study not only provides a dynamically adapted image feature extraction scheme for the fragmented operation and maintenance of power metering assets, but also provides a referable technical path for the intelligent optimization of visual feature extraction in multiple scenarios."

EdgeAware describes a framework containing four salient components: a Latency-Aware Task Offloading Module, Federated Model Partitioning (FMP), Adaptive QoS Scheduling, and a Context-Aware Feedback Loop, it strategically integrates them to distribute workloads between edge and cloud. The amount of workloads sent to the cloud or edge is determined through real-time system metrics and reinforcement learning.

To identify the best features for attack detection, we presented a new Dynamic Hippopotamus Dipper Optimization (DHDO) method based on a hybrid of Dynamic Dipper Throated Optimization (DDTO) and the Hippopotamus optimization algorithm (HOA). Next, we used the new deep learning algorithm GenConvNet (Generative Convolutional Networks) for intrusion detection. GenConvNet adopted aspects of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), through which we improved detection of known and unknown attacks. We implemented the proposed model using Python and tested the model using the ICS-ADD dataset. We reported an accuracy of 94.5%, precision of 93.8%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 95.2% for the proposed DHDO model.

This model eliminates the requirement of laboratory and promote the use of non-invasive sampling technique. This proposed solution offers a low-cost, portable, and user-friendly approach to immunity monitoring."

    "abstract": "The increasing global occurrence of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation highlights the critical need for scalable and automated detection mechanisms. Traditional methods often lack real-time applicability and may exhibit biases due to data imbalance, limiting their effectiveness in early identification. This work addresses these challenges by proposing a Natural Language-based mental health classification system leveraging a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to analyze user-generated textual data. A Kaggle mental health dataset comprising 53,043 statements was pre-processed through normalization, and class imbalance was mitigated using RandomOverSampler (ROS). Without ROS, the model showed a strong bias toward the majority classes, leading to suboptimal performance, particularly for underrepresented conditions. Post-ROS implementation, the system achieved notable improvements, with accuracy rising from 87% to 91%, and F1-scores for minority classes such as Bipolar and Suicidal reaching up to 0.99. The final model was integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to enable real-time, accessible mental health screening. Overall, this approach offers a scalable solution for digital mental health monitoring and early intervention by helping identify and support the treatment of individuals showing signs of psychological distress."

The enhanced sensitivity can be characterized by the increased Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the homodyne output, before and after the loss change occurs. When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the increase in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency. In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, and consider the ratio of quantum to classical KL divergences as a metric for quantum speedup. We generalize previous results on <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n=1$</tex> (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n$</tex>, and discuss the monotonicity and asymptotics of this ratio with respect to the parameters of the quantum probe. Assuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and receiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching capabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have suffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their sensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe construction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss change identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses. We then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule, which allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the faulty links using our constructed probes. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves a quantum speedup in decreasing the localization delay."

This work outlines the key issue of detecting fake reviews that erode consumer trust and site reputation. Conventional detection systems such as support vector machines and decision trees are susceptible to failure in successful detection of anonymous spammers. In an attempt to address such shortcomings, by introducing an advanced fake review detection system incorporating a variant K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with text sentiment analysis and behavioral pattern analysis.

Prone to inconsistencies in handling product lines, monolithic ACs can complicate traceability of claims, arguments and evidence. We previously introduced the separation of assurance for certain medical devices into two linked ACs: a Technological Assurance Case (TAC), addressing system safety concerns disregarding clinical effects on patients; and a Clinical Assurance Case (CAC), addressing safety of a clinical application. A key observed gap is the absence of traceability that links them to extend their utility. We now propose a traceability metamodel as part of TACTICS (Traceable Assurance Cases for Trustworthy Integrated Compliance and Safety), a model-based methodology to support traceability across multiple assurance cases. We present an overview of this traceability process, conceptually, using a TAC/CAC for a medical system as an example, discussing its benefits, challenges and limitations."

    "abstract": "The scaling up of trapped-ion quantum processors based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture is difficult owing to the extensive electronics and high-density wiring required to control numerous trap electrodes. In conventional QCCD architectures, each trap electrode is controlled via a dedicated digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The conventional approach places an overwhelming demand on electronic resources and wiring complexity. This is because the number of trap electrodes typically exceeds the number of trapped-ion qubits. This study proposes a method that leverages a high-speed DAC to generate time-division multiplexed signals to control a large-scale QCCD trapped-ion quantum processor. The proposed method replaces conventional DACs with a single high-speed DAC that generates the complete voltage waveforms required to control the trap electrodes, thereby significantly reducing the wiring complexity and overall resource requirements. Based on realistic parameters and commercially available electronics, our analysis demonstrates that a QCCD trapped-ion quantum computer with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0, 0 0 0}$</tex> trap electrodes can be controlled using only 13 field-programmable gate arrays and 104 high-speed DACs.

    "abstract": "The rapidly growing number of electronic devices requiring frequent charging is driving the critical need for the development of one-to-many wireless power transfer systems. Theoretical analysis of critical coupling in a one-to-many inductive power transfer (IPT) system is conducted. Based on the analytical results, a framework for evaluating critical coupling as a function of the number of receivers and their spatial position is provided. The developed approach allows to predict combinations of receiver number and placement that lead to critical coupling condition in the system. An experimental prototype was fabricated to validate the analytical model and the proposed framework. The theoretically predicted critical coupling is confirmed experimentally through the direct measurements of power delivered to the load (PDL) and power transfer efficiency (PTE) in case of one, two and three receivers. This analysis expands the understanding of one-to-many IPT systems and can be used for further investigation of critical coupling. From a practical perspective, this research opens promising directions for designing one-to-many IPT systems that can maintain predefined PDL and/or PTE levels despite changes in the number of receivers, or support predefined operational mode (fast charging, effective charging) for a fixed number of receivers. This functionalities can be achieved through proper positioning of the receivers on the marked surface of the transmitter without any additional control circuits or sophisticated control algorithms. Such one-to-many IPT systems show significant potential for both consumer electronics and industrial applications."

In this study, we proposed a fiber optic ultrasonic sensor with a composite diaphragm structure.

A graphene-silver composite film (20 nm/200 nm) served as the sensing diaphragm, while insulating materials formed a compact ultrasonic probe. The cavity length of the probe was meticulously optimized to ensure optimal performance. The transducer’s performance was experimentally evaluated in transformer oil. Results showed that it maintained stable performance, achieving a minimum detectable pressure of 3.8 mPa and an ultrasonic sensitivity of 802.2 nm/kPa. The proposed device exhibited superior average sensitivity and frequency response compared with conventional piezoelectric transducers over a broad frequency range of 20-300 kHz. Its compact structure, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and real-time demodulation capability offered an innovative solution for ultrasonic inspection of power transformers."

However, existing AIGC services typically operate within a centralized framework, resulting in high response times. To address this issue, we integrate collaborative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology to reduce processing delays for AIGC services. Current collaborative MEC methods primarily support single-server offloading or facilitate interactions among fixed Edge Servers (ESs), limiting flexibility and resource utilization across all ESs to meet the varying computing and networking requirements of AIGC services. We propose AMCoEdge, an adaptive multi-server collaborative MEC approach to enhancing AIGC service efficiency. The AMCoEdge fully utilizes the computing and networking resources across all ESs through adaptive multi-ES selection and dynamic workload allocation, thereby minimizing the offloading make-span of AIGC services. Our design features an online distributed algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, accompanied by theoretical analyses that confirm an approximate linear time complexity.

    "abstract": "Transient thermal analysis captures the high accuracy and time-varying temperature distribution of chip components. However, during the early thermal design iterations of 3D ICs and chiplets, time-consuming transient thermal simulations lead to prolonged waiting times for engineers. Existing widely adopted deterministic methods or innovative neural network-based methods face significant challenges in reducing the thermal simulation time when geometric structures change iteratively. With prior knowledge of the chip’s regions of interest, localized stochastic methods may present a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel high-precision and efficient stochastic solver for transient thermal analysis of ICs, based on the probabilistic solution of the heat equation obtained from the Feynman- Kac formula. As a field solver for the heat equation, the proposed method adopts the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">spacetime</i> walk-on-sphere (WOS) scheme and enhances it with the novel boundary treatment integrated to guarantee the accuracy of addressing mixed boundary conditions, particularly Robin boundary conditions. A time-dependent fixed random walk is also combined to handle heat-source regions. Experimental results show that the proposed solver maintains high accuracy with average absolute error within 0.27 K and maximum absolute error within 1 K, achieves a speedup of 26.8-211× at a single point compared to the 3D-ICE simulator of similar accuracy, has general geometry applicability as a field solver, and exhibits excellent parallel efficiency."

While QML models such as variational quantum classifiers (QVC), quantum multilayer perceptron(QMLP) models and quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) have demonstrated promise in applications like image recognition and malware classification, they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. Inspired by the vulnerabilities in classical ML, this work systematically investigates how attacks-ranging from training-time poisoning and inferencetime evasion (e.g., quantum versions of FGSM and PGD) to deployment-time trigger attacks-manifest in quantum circuits. We explore how classical adversarial strategies adapt to quantum models through parameterized encodings, hybrid architectures, and probabilistic outputs. The poster evaluates different quantum classifiers under adversarial settings, comparing their robustness, trainability, and resilience to perturbations. Defense mechanisms such as randomized encoding, engineered noise channels, and quantum adversarial training are analyzed in relation to specific threat types. In addition, we assess how quantum models behave differently than classical counterparts under attack, and how quantum-specific design constraints can either exacerbate or mitigate these effects. Our ultimate goal is to define and construct robust QML systems that are both theoretically sound and practically secure. By synthesizing results across multiple QML architectures and threat models, this work provides actionable insight into the development of resilient quantum classifiers, paving the way toward trustworthy and scalable quantum machine learning."

Among the other types of biometric methods, face recognition-based biometrics are more popular now a days due to its contactless authentication method and optimum complexity, cost and performance ratio. In this paper, we have performed an extensive survey on the different types of face recognition algorithms and architectures. The latest algorithms with respect to recognition accuracy and recognition time are analysed. In face recognition, a covariate is an influence that either independently increases intra-class variability, decreases inter-class variability, or does both. Covariates such as position, illumination, expression, age, and disguise are classified as existing covariates of face recognition. The literature has extensively studied and established these factors. However, as facial recognition technology has advanced, so too have a myriad of exciting new uses emerged. These include the capacity to identify individuals from recordings, match forensic sketches to mugshot images, and identify faces that have undergone plastic surgery. Face detection is the initial step of an automated face recognition system, as was previously explained. The inconsistency in scale, location, orientation, facial expression, occlusion, and lighting makes face detection a difficult task."

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising direction in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offering computational and memory advantages by harnessing superposition and entanglement. However, QML models often face challenges in scalability and expressiveness due to hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose quantum mixture of experts (QMoE), a novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE) paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input. The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks, highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work paves the way for scalable and interpretable quantum learning frameworks."

    "abstract": "As quantum computing continues to mature, more developers are designing, coding, and simulating quantum circuits. A challenge exists, however, in debugging quantum circuits, particularly as they scale in size and complexity. Given the lack of effective debugging workflows, developers are forced to manually inspect their circuits and analyze various quantum states, which is error-prone and time-consuming. In this research, we present a statistical assertion-based debugging workflow for CUDA-Q. CUDA-Q has gained popularity due to its ability to leverage GPUs to accelerate quantum circuit simulations; this allows circuits to scale to larger depths and widths, where they can be particularly hard to debug by hand. Inspired by and building from prior Qiskit-based debuggers, our work allows CUDA-Q users to verify quantum program correctness with greater ease. Through the insertion of statistical assertions within a quantum circuit, our tool provides valuable insights into the state of qubits at any point within a circuit, tracks their evolution, and helps detect deviations from expected behavior. Furthermore, we improve the reliability and accuracy of the product state assertion by using a combination of Fisher's exact test and the Monte Carlo Method instead of a chi-square test, and examine the impact of CUDA-Q's distinct kernel-based programming model on the design of our debugging tool. This work offers a practical solution to one of CUDA-Q's usability gaps, paving the way for more reliable and efficient quantum software development."

Firstly, it adopts the application-level metric RPS instead of cluster-level metrics (e.g., CPU) to directly reflect traffic fluctuations, reducing latency in converting traffic fluctuations into measurable metrics. Secondly, a combined Conv1D-TSMixer model predicts future load, enabling the HPA to proactively perform scaling operations, thereby eliminating reactive delays. Furthermore, ICEEMDAN-VMD secondary decomposition is applied prior to prediction to reduce data non-stationarity and complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the Conv1D-TSMixer model achieves higher prediction accuracy than ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer models.

    "abstract": "In an era marked by accelerated technological change and digital transformation, the need for continuous professional development among engineers has become more urgent than ever. The World Economic Forum's 2023 report forecasts that 50 % of all employees will require reskilling by 2025, with the engineering sector experiencing particularly high pressure to adapt. More than 70 % of engineers are expected to upskill in emerging areas, including artificial intelligence, sustainable engineering, data analytics, and advanced manufacturing technologies. Despite this pressing demand, a persistent gap remains between the competencies developed through academic programs and the practical skills required by industry. This disconnect poses a significant challenge to both educational institutions and employers seeking to prepare and retain a future-ready engineering workforce. This paper explores the potential of industry-academia collaboration as a strategic mechanism to bridge this gap and enhance the continuous professional development of engineering students. By analyzing a series of case studies and existing partnership models, the research examines the effectiveness of collaborative initiatives, including structured internship programs, co-designed curricula, joint research projects, and faculty-industry exchanges. These initiatives are shown to enrich students' learning experiences by integrating real-world challenges into academic settings, thereby fostering a more holistic and practice-oriented educational approach. Findings indicate that such partnerships significantly improve students' disciplinary competencies, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Graduates emerging from programs with strong industry ties demonstrate a higher degree of professional readiness, adaptability, and alignment with current technological and business trends. Furthermore, sustained collaboration helps academic institutions stay abreast of evolving industry standards while enabling companies to influence talent development. Ultimately, the paper argues that a deepening alliance between industry and academia is not only beneficial but essential for cultivating a responsive, innovative, and competitive engineering workforce capable of thriving in the dynamic landscape of the 21st century."

    "abstract": "Software aging, a phenomenon where long-running software systems degrade in performance or become prone to failures over time, presents a critical challenge in maintaining the reliability of software systems. In recent years, machine learning models have shown promise in detecting software aging early, enabling proactive measures to mitigate its effects. However, the black-box nature of many machine learning techniques raises concerns regarding their interpretability, particularly in critical environments like healthcare systems, financial systems, and autonomous vehicles. This paper highlights the importance of explainability in deep learning models, which are a type of machine learning, for software aging detection, emphasizing that interpretability is essential for building trust in their predictions. We introduce the Interpretable Software Aging Analysis Tool (ISAAT) as a solution. ISAAT offers comprehensive analysis and visualization of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) by using flowcharts to illustrate model structure and operations, and large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed, human-readable explanations of model decisions. The results demonstrate that ISAAT enhances the transparency of machine learning models, making them more interpretable and promoting greater trust in their application for software aging detection."

Conventional techniques for ECG signal classification frequently depend on manually crafted aspects and may not grasp complex temporal dependencies. This study suggests utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a kind of recurrent neural network (RNN), for the automatic classification of ECG signals. LSTMs are excellent at understanding sequential models and have illustrated potential in various temporal series chores. This technique encompasses handling the raw ECG signals and altering them into sequences apt for input into an LSTM network. The LSTM model is trained on a classified dataset comprising normal and abnormal ECG signals. The network masters to grasp detailed temporal models, empowering it to perceive subtle differences suggesting cardiac anomalies. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in detecting Atrial Fibrillation with good accuracy of $93.2 \\%$, offering a robust and automated solution for early cardiac arrhythmia detection. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance clinical diagnostics by enabling timely and accurate identification of abnormal heart rhythms, ultimately improving patient outcomes."

A dedicated experimental setup was used to monitor VM behavior via automated workloads. The results showed progressive increases in RAM and CPU usage, indicating clear signs of software aging.

This paper presents a hybrid recommendation framework using rule-based filtering in conjunction with an ensemble of machine-learning models to give the user personalized and explainable recommendations of welfare schemes. The user profile containing demographic, economic, and geographic factors was validated against the rule-based eligibility conditions, and the qualified schemes were ranked using suite ensemble machine-learning classifiers (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks). The system uses advanced feature engineering and cross-validation to learn complex relationships of behavior between the user and scheme whilst exhibiting robustness. Experimental evaluation indicates that the hybrid approach is always more accurate and generalizable than either of the machine-learning models independently. The system architecture is a full-stack web architecture, able to scale, and also allows for dynamic management of schemes by being administered via an admin dashboard. This research provides significant contributions towards the initiatives stated in Digital India by reducing the gap in awareness, encouraging citizen activity and engagement with the government, and improving inclusivity of the digital economy and governance."

    "abstract": "Real-world optimization problems must undergo a series of transformations before becoming solvable on current quantum hardware. Even for a fixed problem, the number of possible transformation paths-from industry-relevant formulations through binary constrained linear programs (BILPs), to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and finally to a hardware-executable representation-is remarkably large. Each step introduces free parameters, such as Lagrange multipliers, encoding strategies, slack variables, rounding schemes or algorithmic choices-making brute-force exploration of all paths intractable. In this work, we benchmark a representative subset of these transformation paths using a realworld industrial production planning problem with industry data: the optimization of work allocation in a press shop producing vehicle parts. We focus on QUBO reformulations and algorithmic parameters for both quantum annealing (QA) and the Linear Ramp Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (LR-QAOA). Our goal is to identify a reduced set of effective configurations applicable to similar industrial settings. Our results show that QA on D-Wave hardware consistently produces near-optimal solutions, whereas LR-QAOA on IBM quantum devices struggles to reach comparable performance. Hence, the choice of hardware and solver strategy significantly impacts performance. The problem formulation and especially the penalization strategy determine the solution quality. Most importantly, mathematically-defined penalization strategies are equally successful as hand-picked penalty factors, paving the way for automated QUBO formulation. Moreover, we observe a strong correlation between simulated and quantum annealing performance metrics, offering a scalable proxy for predicting QA behavior on larger problem instances."

    "abstract": "As systemic change efforts in higher education increasingly depend on faculty development and collaboration, staff sense of belonging emerges as a foundational condition for sustaining such initiatives. The Change Makers in Engineering Education program-part of South Africa's Integrated Engineering Curriculum (IEC) project-offers a professional learning space for academic staff to reflect, connect, and build capacity for change as catalysts of curriculum transformation. While the program focuses on enabling agency and pedagogical change, an important outcome has been the cultivation of a sense of belonging among participants. Drawing on Strayhorn's multidimensional model of belonging in higher education, we understand belonging as a contextual and developmental experience of membership, recognition, emotional safety, agency, and mattering-particularly important in high-stakes academic environments. This study explores how academic staff participating in the Change Makers program experience a sense of belonging in their academic work and institutional community. Specifically, it seeks to answer the question: How does participation in Change Makers program cultivate a sense of belonging that enables or drives meaningful transformation? Data was drawn from participant reflections gathered across multiple cohorts that participated in 2023 and 2024, using semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was applied using Strayhorn's belonging framework, exploring expressions of belonging across five dimensions: interpersonal connection, institutional recognition, shared purpose, emotional safety, and agency. Preliminary findings indicate that belonging is strongly associated with the program's focus on human connection, personal storytelling, and recognition of academic identity beyond performance metrics. Participants describe the space as affirming, generative, and emotionally safe-a contrast to institutional environments often perceived as isolating or performative. However, many staff expressed difficulty sustaining this sense of belonging and capacity for change outside the program, pointing to institutional misalignment and limited structural support for relational and reflective professional spaces. The Change Makers program illustrates how intentionally designed faculty development spaces can enable the sense of belonging and agency needed to build individual and collective capacity for change. Embedding such spaces within broader institutional ecosystems-while addressing systemic barriers to recognition, relational trust, and inclusion-may be key to sustaining long-term transformation. This study offers insights for institutions seeking to support academic staff well-being, connection, and commitment through transformative professional learning that prioritizes the human dimensions of educational change."

    "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common problem in diabetic patients that, if not treated promptly and properly, may cause severe infections and even lead to amputation of the leg or, in severe cases, the patient’s death. Early and accurate diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcers is very important, especially in countries where access to doctors and specialized services is limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic approach using image preprocessing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we use Canny edge detection to enhance edges in DFU images and investigate whether deep models focus on edges. We then evaluate its impact on the performance of EfficientNet, a deep learning model, for binary classification of foot ulcers with and without ischemia. The experimental results revealed that preprocessing the images with edge detection did not necessarily improve model performance compared to raw data, since the best accuracy of $93 \\%$ and an F1-score of 0.93 was obtained when trained on the raw data. The findings suggest that while edge detection emphasizes certain image features, its application to DFU images requires further refinement to address their unique characteristics. This research highlights the potential of deep learning in DFU detection while emphasizing the need for continued innovation in preprocessing methods and model architectures to improve clinical applicability."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in quantum-inspired machine learning have highlighted the potential of using non-classical effects to enhance feature extraction and improve robustness. In particular, continuous-variable (CV) systems on photonic platforms offer operations such as single-mode and two-mode squeezing that naturally encode quantum correlations. Motivated by the need for increasingly resilient and expressive deep learning architectures, we propose a novel Hybrid Continuous-Variable Squeezing Network (HCVS-Net) that unifies these quantum-inspired CV operations with classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by skip-connection. Specifically, a conventional CNN first extracts preliminary features, which are subsequently embedded into CV modes undergoing controllable squeezing gates, emulating spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This process yields enriched feature representations through quadrature measurements. Our experimental results on MNIST confirm that HCVS-Net surpasses purely classical baselines, achieving both competitive accuracy and heightened resilience to brightness distortions. Under low brightness conditions of 0.1, the accuracy is about 3% higher than that of pure CNN. Furthermore, the entire model is end-to-end differentiable, allowing both classical parameters and quantum-like squeezing parameters to be trained jointly via backpropagation."

In this paper, we systematically study various types of crosstalk noise and quantify their effects on surface codes through memory and stability experiments. Based on our findings, we introduce crosstalk-robust implementations of QEC via flag qubit designs and redundant stabilizer checks. We perform both numerical and analytical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of these strategies.

A systematic technique for disease marker identification uses GC skew and codon bias pattern analysis of human mitochondrial DNA sequences according to this research. Scientists applied static window sizes to analyze mtDNA as they processed both GC skew and GC content measurements within each segment. The extracted sequence data from the program underwent normalization processing that created heatmaps which were reduced to 66-dimensional vectors. The vectors included 64 codon frequency measurements together with two compositional statistics. The Extreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost) classifier obtained its segment training labels from MITOMAP disease associations. The analysis included two features known by researchers as A+T skew and RSCU that boosted their performance as enrichment tools. The SHAP analysis method performed the interpretation of the models. The results show good predictive performance along with a constant feature influence which demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating codon-originated features with combination-based features for finding mitochondrial disease biomarkers.

In this work, we formulate researcher-topic affinity prediction as a binary classification task (high vs. non-high) using a real-world dataset of 42,046 Portuguese theses and dissertations defended in Brazil in 2023. We evaluate three families of lightweight filtering mechanisms: (i) lexical baselines, (ii) cosine-similarity thresholding on BERT embeddings, and (iii) lightweight classifiers applied to pooled embeddings. Beyond accuracy, we explicitly account for environmental impact by measuring emissions (kg CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>) using CodeCarbon, which offers a carbon-aware evaluation of model efficiency. Results show that while lexical filters are nearly carbon-free but underperform, similarity thresholding provides modest improvements, and lightweight classifiers deliver the best trade-off in terms of performance. Our best model, Granite embeddings with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and max pooling, achieves an F1-macro of 0.779 with only 0.00227 kg CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, significantly outperforming baselines while keeping emissions negligible.

In conjunction, the ViewDiff, ArtCrafter, and ACE frameworks have markedly improved the domain with 3D-consistent models. Several strategies such as SceneBooth maintain accuracy for the subjects and smooth backgrounds through the use of multi-modal layout generation with ControlNet and Gated Self-Attention adapters. Newly, PromptGuard enables the moderation of unsafe content by the use of soft prompts without compromising the performance of the model. The cyclic evaluation metric CAMScore facilitates Gap Between the modality in a traditional evaluation approach through consistency across modalities and examining the details. Prompting guards assist in retaining model performance while moderating unsafe content through soft prompts. This comprehensive framework achieves the highest scores on various benchmarks and surpasses other techniques."

    "abstract": "Reproducing concurrency failures is essential for debugging, but these failures are extremely difficult to replicate because of their unpredictable, nondeterministic nature. Prior studies have shown that certain runtime conditions-such as CPU utilization, memory availability, and the number of CPU cores-can significantly affect the probability of failure manifestation. However, the optimal conditions that can maximize the probability of reproducing concurrency failures vary across different applications. This paper provides a systematic approach to determining the optimal conditions for a given application that suffers from concurrency failures. Our method employs reinforcement learning to control running conditions and identify optimal settings. The target program runs inside a Docker container, enabling precise manipulation of CPU and memory resources. We evaluated our approach on two realworld programs with known concurrency bugs by using four reinforcement learning algorithms. For specific algorithms, there exists a clear upward trend in failure reproduction rates across successive trials, confirming our method's effectiveness."

As the scale and complexity of cloud infrastructures grow, traditional security mechanisms are proving insufficient against advanced cyber threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), malware attacks, and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) exploits. The proposed framework leverages the computational power of quantum systems to enhance the performance of Deep Learning models, enabling faster and more accurate threat detection. ZKEs provide privacy-preserving authentication by verifying user identities without revealing sensitive information, while Block chain ensures data integrity, decentralization, and tamper-proof transaction records. Experimental evaluationconducted using IBM Qiskit and a honey net-integrated Deep Neural Network (DNN) demonstrates a significant improvement in detection accuracy, reduced response time, and enhanced system resilience compared to conventional approaches. The results validate the effectiveness of the multi-layered model in addressing real-world cloud security challenges. This research contributes a scalable, privacy-centric, and quantum-secure architectural foundation for the next generation of cloud-based systems"

    "abstract": "Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (ML-IDS) rely on high-quality datasets with structured labels to effectively identify complex and evolving cyber threats. However, most existing IDS datasets rely on single data sources and coarse labels, which restrict their ability to accurately model multi-stage adversarial behavior. To address these issues, we proposed AR-MANO (Attack Reproduction with Management and Orchestration), a modular framework for orchestrating synchronized attack reproduction and data collection from various sources, including accounting, Syslog, and traffic. AR-MANO enables the creation of the CREMEv3 dataset, a scalable, multi-source IDS dataset labeled with MITRE ATT&CK techniques and the attack lifecycle. We evaluated CREMEv3 using eight machine learning classifiers and obtained average F1-scores of 0.6483 for technique classification and 0.5410 for lifecycle classification without feature selection. After applying feature selection, these scores improved to 0.9572 and 0.8317, respectively. CREMEv3 outperformed CIC-IDS2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and UNSW-NB15, with a class imbalance ratio of about 0.1, class entropy of 0.56, and a Gini coefficient of approximately 1.0. CREMEv3 provides a robust and scalable foundation for the development and evaluation of ML-based IDS."

This paper investigates the impact of ionizing radiation on F2F 3D ICs by employing TCAD-based simulations. In particular, we analyze charge generation and collection dynamics resulting from energetic particle strikes through detailed device-level modeling. Our findings offer insight into the interaction mechanisms between stacked layers and provide valuable data for improving Soft Error Rate (SER) evaluation methodologies in 3D IC designs."

    "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces complications such as the selection of appropriate weights to balance the different objectives. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale. This allows for more balanced solutions to be found when combining these objectives directly, as well as potentially assisting in the search or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its advantages through empirical evaluations on various multiobjective optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting scalarization weights is cumbersome; and reliable, efficient solutions are scarce."

In the presented experiments, two types of circuits are used: one with alternating layers of rotations and entanglement, and the other, similar to the first one, but with an additional final layer of rotations. As rotation layers, all combinations of one and two rotation sequences are considered. Four different entanglement topologies are compared: linear, circular, pairwise, and full. Different tasks are considered, namely the generation of probability distributions and images, and image classification. Achieved results are correlated with the expressibility and entanglement capability of the different circuits to understand how these features affect performance."

    "abstract": "Fatty liver disease is a growing global health concern that often remains undiagnosed due to the lack of early and accurate detection methods. Conventional diagnostic techniques, including ultrasound and liver biopsy, suffer from limitations such as operator dependency, invasiveness, and reduced sensitivity in early stages. Additionally, existing automated approaches are constrained by poor feature representation, limited segmentation accuracy, and inefficient modeling of spatial dependencies in liver imaging. These challenges lead to delayed diagnosis and hinder clinical decision-making. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes an advanced deep learning-based segmentation and classification framework using the TransUNet architecture for effective detection of fatty liver from abdominal ultrasound images. TransUNet integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for capturing local features and transformers for modeling long-range dependencies, thereby offering robust performance in medical image analysis. The methodology includes systematic data collection, comprehensive preprocessing (including resizing, normalization, and augmentation), and rigorous training using labeled ultrasound datasets. The proposed architecture enables fine-grained segmentation by leveraging self-attention mechanisms and skip connections, leading to enhanced region-level feature extraction and reduced false detections. Extensive performance evaluation is conducted using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and detection reliability compared to baseline methods. The approach provides a non-invasive, efficient, and scalable diagnostic alternative, contributing to the advancement of AI-driven liver disease diagnosis in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Traditional classroom teaching approaches often lack immediate feedback. This limits instructors' ability to adapt their teaching based on student engagement and learning patterns. Immediate recognition of student behaviors is essential for the use of adaptive teaching methodologies. However, classroom occlusions and the recognition of small objects remain significant challenges in this field. To address these issues, this study introduces DSW-YOLO, a detector based on YOLOv10n that incorporates frequency-domain fusion and gated attention techniques. The DSW-YOLO model consists of three important components. The C2f-WTConv-SE module combines Haar wavelet convolutions with SE attention to generate multifrequency information, improve receptive fields, and detect small objects. The SEAM-gated continuous attention module utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and occlusion-confidence gating. This technique reduces background noise and manages the occlusions. The Dynamic Head module employs multilevel attention, adaptive sampling, and task-aware gating. This methodology improves the feature representation of the small objects. In comparison to YOLOv10n, DSW-YOLO shows improvements of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.7 \\%, 3.9 \\%$</tex>, and 2.6 % in accuracy, recall, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{mAP50}$</tex>, respectively, underscoring its efficacy in identifying student behaviors."

This paper identifies the most significant factors that are causing this gap, ranging from fastpaced technological advancements, skill gaps, and competition from across the world for AI talent. Based on a thorough literature review and industry analysis, this research recognizes trends influencing the AI workforce and methods to close the talent gap. Schools are developing AI curricula, online education platforms are providing affordable training, and companies are investing in workforce upskilling. Government initiatives encouraging STEM education and funding for AI research also aid talent development. Our research emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary teamwork, ongoing learning, and responsible AI practices in building a sustainable AI workforce. Meeting these challenges demands a multi-pronged effort from academia, industry, and policymakers.

We benchmark Text2Graph on a zero-shot setting using five datasets spanning topic classification and sentiment analysis tasks, comparing multiple variants against other zero-shot approaches for text classification. In addition to reporting performance, we provide detailed estimates of energy consumption and carbon emissions, showing that graph-based propagation achieves competitive results at a fraction of the energy and environmental cost."
