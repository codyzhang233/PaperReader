    "abstract": "Time-frequency analysis (TFA) methods are significant in vibration signal analysis and fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. However, large-scale mechanical equipment such as aerospace engine works under fast-varying rotation speed, leading to blurred time-frequency representation (TFR) from vibration signals for health monitoring. Meanwhile, it should be noticed that with the development of measuring techniques, the difficulty in acquiring rotation speed signals is decreasing, which should be considered to be utilized in TFA. In this study, a novel time-frequency analysis method referred to as velocity guided chirplet transform (VGCT) is proposed. This method directly uses rotation speed signal to describe the instantaneous frequency of the basis functions, and the basis functions are constructed by numerical integration instead of analytic expression to match the harmonic components in vibration signals, which can achieve the best performance in violent non-stationary signal analysis. After that, a numeric simulation was given to test its performance and computational efficiency. Finally, this paper gave two experiment cases, which showed its applicability and advantage in the field of health management for the aerospace equipment."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel wheelchair–exoskeleton hybrid robot featuring a retractable parallelogram lift, developed to assist individuals with mobility impairments in transitioning between ambulation over uneven terrain and seated navigation on smooth surfaces. The system enables stable sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions by maintaining ground contact through a wheelchair equipped with a front differential drive and rear omni wheels. In the upright position, the foldable lift retracts and repositions the driving platform vertically behind the user, removing obstructions during walking. The exoskeleton structure supports the lift’s weight, allowing full ground contact through the user’s feet for improved mobility. The parallelogram lift produces a curvilinear seat trajectory, with design parameters derived from kinematic analysis to closely emulate natural sit-to-stand motion. A dynamic model was formulated to estimate the seat reaction force and actuation requirements across various postures, incorporating hip and knee moments provided by the exoskeleton to enhance physical human–robot interaction. Preliminary experiments were conducted with four healthy participants performing sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions under three distinct support conditions: no support, lift support, and combined hip support. Consistent with the theoretical simulation, the seat reaction forces recorded from multiple participants confirmed that the lift mechanism supports up to approximately fifty percent of their body weight. Surface electromyography recorded from the quadriceps and hamstring muscles provides insight into the underlying muscle activation patterns and inter-muscular coordination during assisted movement. These results contribute to the understanding and optimization of human–robot interaction in hybrid assistive systems."

An asynchronous coarse control ensures a fast load transient response to meet the dynamic demands of digital loads. In parallel, a fine-loop voltage stabilizer, equipped with dual-mode operation, enables ripple-free and precise voltage regulation essential for noise-sensitive analog loads. The dual-mode operation employs binary-shifting to quickly reach the target output voltage (VOUT), followed by unary-shifting for fine-tuned VOUT adjustment, thereby minimizing the output voltage ripples (VRIPP).

    "abstract": "The naval air defense planning (NADP) problem entails the defense of a naval fleet against aerial threats. This complex and dynamic problem requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to evolving warfare environment. While our previous work addressed the static NADP problem by proposing a mathematical model and heuristic solutions for sensor allocation, engagement scheduling, and ship routing, this study extends to the dynamic NADP problem. Unlike the static version, which assumes complete knowledge of future threats, the dynamic NADP problem requires continuous updates and real-time adjustments to decisions as new threats emerge and situational parameters change. We present modifications in the mathematical formulation, which is based on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, alongside a comprehensive simulation structure. We employ heuristic solution approaches that utilize a combination of a genetic algorithm, construction of an engagement graph to solve the shortest path problem, and dynamic programming (DP) techniques. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing the dynamic NADP problem. The study also explores machine learning models for threat prioritization, offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by dynamic naval air defense scenarios."

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models have the potential to transform military battlefields, presenting a large external pressure to rapidly incorporate them into operational settings. However, it is well-established that these ML models are vulnerable to a number of adversarial attacks throughout the model deployment pipeline that threaten to negate battlefield advantage. One broad category is privacy attacks (such as model inversion) where an adversary can reverse engineer information from the model, such as the sensitive data used in its training. The ability to quantify the risk of model inversion attacks (MIAs) is not well studied, and there is a lack of automated developmental test and evaluation (DT&E) tools and metrics to quantify the effectiveness of privacy loss of the MIA. The current DT&E process is difficult because ML model inversions can be hard for a human to interpret, subjective when they are interpretable, and difficult to quantify in terms of inversion quality. Additionally, scaling the DT&E process is challenging due to many ML model architectures and data modalities that need to be assessed. In this work, we present a novel DT&E tool that quantifies the risk of data privacy loss from MIAs and introduces four adversarial risk dimensions to quantify privacy loss. Our DT&E pipeline combines inversion with vision language models (VLMs) to improve effectiveness while enabling scalable analysis. We demonstrate effectiveness using multiple MIA techniques and VLMs configured for zero-shot classification and image captioning. We benchmark the pipeline using several state-of-the-art MIAs in the computer vision domain with an image classification task that is typical in military applications. In general, our innovative pipeline extends the current model inversion DT&E capabilities by improving the effectiveness and scalability of the privacy loss analysis in an automated fashion. With it, a clearer understanding of the risk to military ML-enabled capabilities can be obtained."

    "abstract": "Uniqueness, liveness, and counterfeiting resistance by finger vein authentication have rendered it a secure and reliable biometric modality. Finger vein patterns, unlike external features such as fingerprints or face, are subcutaneous, i.e., not visible to the naked eye and extremely difficult to replicate. Image capture, preprocessing, vein enhancement, feature extraction, template creation, and matching are all typical elements of an average system. In different imaging conditions, preprocessing methods like adaptive Wiener filtering, homomorphic unshading, and enhancement of vesselness increase visibility a lot. From deep models such as Siamese networks to graph anatomical analysis and texture features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), feature extraction methods address many issues of noise, illumination, and orientation. Hybrid methods that blend handcrafted with deep features for increased robustness are the focus of recent literature. These developments show finger vein verification's promise in safe usages such as financial, medicine, and immigration control."

    "abstract": "Object classification refers to the identification, localization, and categorization of several objects present within a single image. The challenges faced using the traditional object classification approaches include lower classification accuracy, increased computational complexity, poor scalability, and additional resource requirements. To overcome such drawbacks, the research proposes the Hybrid Distributed attention-enabled Dual learning assisted Fight-Or-Free optimized deep network (HD2FBCN) model. Specifically, the Hybrid Distributed Attention (HyDA) mechanism boosts the object classification performance by simultaneously capturing the cross-dimensional complex and informative features. The dual learning strategy simulates faster classification and improves the scalability by diminishing the data scarcity and catastrophic forgetting issues. Moreover, the Structural Transformer Shape (STS) descriptor emphasizes the extraction of distinct features and ensures accurate object classification. Nevertheless, finetuning the model parameters with the Fight-Or-Free Optimization algorithm improves the robustness of the model against premature convergence and results in efficient object classification. Experimental validation shows that the HD2FBCN attains superior object classification performance with a reduced False Omission Rate of 0.013, and Mean Squared Error of 3.53, and a higher Negative Predictive Value of 0.98, for the 9 K-Folds using the COCO dataset."

Our system implements the Open-Meteo API in which an estimate for a year long hourly weather forecast, is capable that can be retrieved from. Additionally, the SoilGrids API, assesses soil properties, and has access to several existing agricultural crop databases for agricultural intelligence usage. In terms of energy potential, we have determined the energy potential for both solar and wind, whilst making the discourse about crop selection properties locally. The application also incorporates satellite imagery, interactive dashboards for visualization of data, and report generating options to export reports of analysis.

This paper suggests a hybrid chrono-analytics model that combines K-Means clustering and time-series forecasting (ARIMA/LSTM) to discover recovery patterns and forecast further patient development. The temporal sequences of all significant clinical indicators were created using the Stroke Prediction Dataset that is publicly available, and thus, it is possible to model the characteristics of both the static and dynamic recovery. K-Means clustering was used to find three unique recovery archetypes, namely: the rapid, gradual, and delayed/relapsing recovery which was validated using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). LMST predictions of future conditions of recovery showed the accurate prediction of future conditions with a higher degree of performance compared to ARIMA, which was mainly unsuccessful in crossing linear lines. The personal patient predictions were used to show that the framework can provide individual predictions on recovery, and the common recovery patterns were identified at the cluster level. The combination approach will fill the gap between descriptive analytics and predictive modelling to provide a new tool of personalized and population-based healthcare decision-making. Strengthen health systems and emergency preparedness.In general, the paper demonstrates how the analysis of temporal data and machine learning may be used to improve patient recovery monitoring and clinical intervention optimization."

This research examines how Bayes Net performs as a classification system by using six different handcraft descriptor techniques when analyzing high-resolution dermatological images. The analysis incorporates six particular feature descriptors which are PHOGF (Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients), SCHF (Simple Color Histogram Filter), Gabor Filter, JPEG Coefficient Filter (JPEGCF), FCTH (Fuzzy Color and Texture Histogram Filter), and FOHF (Fuzzy Opponent Histogram Filter). The research utilized publicly available images from a ten-disordered skin diseases collection for the experiments. The evaluation of classifiers used Accuracy, Precision, Recall together with ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and PRC (Precision-Recall Curve) and computational time measurement metrics. A combination of Gabor Filter with Bayes Net produced the most effective result with an accuracy rate of 97.59% alongside 0.98 precision and recall and 0.99 ROC and PRC scores at a computation time of 0.02 seconds. PHOGF+Bayes Net generated 95.71% accuracy while SCHF+Bayes Net produced 95.49% accuracy but the extended computational time reached 33.63 seconds. The combination of JPEGCF with Bayes Net allowed an efficient execution time to produce 92.83% accuracy results. This research confirms that the combination between custom-designed features and the probabilistic Bayes Net classifier leads to highly precise solutions that maintain rapid computational effectiveness for skin disease diagnosis systems."

    "abstract": "We introduce and study the problem of decentralized model distribution, where a deep neural network is partitioned into fixed blocks of layers, and the assignment of these blocks to networking nodes must be carried out without centralized coordination. This problem naturally arises in edge and fog networks, where nodes can only communicate and compute locally. We show that the decentralized layer assignment task is equivalent to a constrained decentralized graph coloring problem, where each node begins with an arbitrary color representing its initial layer assignment and updates its color through interactions with neighbors. We introduce a distributed color-switching algorithm that guarantees convergence to a valid assignment, where each layer block is uniquely assigned to a node. Once this initialization phase is complete, inference can be initiated from any node in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of an assignment, we define a hop-based inference cost that captures the number of communication steps required to complete a forward pass. Our algorithm supports a decentralized dynamic programming routing algorithm using lightweight tables and enables efficient inference even in complex network topologies. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed approach yields low-cost, low-conflict decentralized inference across a range of realistic network conditions."

Our architecture fuses GPS, LiDAR, and vision modalities in a real-world vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario through KAN-based late fusion. We use convolutional neural networks and Gated Recurrent Units for spatial and temporal feature extraction before passing the features to KAN-based heads. We evaluate the models in regression and classification settings for BP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KAN-based models outperform MLP-based models cross single-and multi-modal setups, yielding significant improvements in beam index prediction accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness of KANs for robust BP in dynamic wireless environments."

This study describes a system called AI-PMF (AI-Based Photographic Memory Framework) which attempts to replicate the cognitive technology of human memory for detecting and retrieving digitally generated materials. The system proposed integrates CNN-focused memory retrieval, contextual retrieval with transformers, and memory retrieval augmentation to identify and cross-reference images automatically. This integrates all three types of memory retrieval proposed in the system. To further the system's generalization ability, training and testing used the system's various components and the four public datasets, DFDC, StyleGAN, FFHQ, and CUISD, which encompass a broad range of real and synthetic imagery. The system's performance is empirically validated with a score of 94% on classification accuracy, 0.92 on F1 score, 0.97 on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and 0.86 on retrieval precision (mAP@10), all of which demonstrate considerable improvement on classification and retrieval compared to baseline deep learning models, EfficientNet and Vision Transformer. Performance results indicate the AI-PMF can be utilized in forensic analysis as it reliably identifies CGI manipulations and retrieves appropriate evidence instances in a visually similar manner. This research establishes a foundation for law enforcement agencies integrated AI systems in criminal investigations where AI can be used reliably and cross-validated with visual evidence for integrated cross-digital evidence analysis and trust-augmented AI in crime."

Furthermore, an encryption layer utilizing AES with a 256-bit key is introduced in a way that is compatible with existing infrastructure, as that is the key to rapid and widespread adoption among consumers and businesses. Through the use of a demonstrative IoT network based on ZigBee, efficiency measurements were taken before and after implementing the proposed solution, and were analyzed in order to judge its viability. Transmission time fluctuations were found likely to be connected with hardware functionality, rather than network retransmissions, as was initially theorized.

We explore the use of federated learning to address some of these challenges in 5G-based MANET communication. We apply federated learning to modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection, which involves balancing throughput and reliability. In highly-dynamic MANETs, the ability to intelligently select an appropriate MCS becomes critical. Federated learning offers a solution by enabling network devices to share learned information instead of learning in isolation. This collaborative approach allows for faster and more informed decision-making. We implement two federated learning-based MCS selection models, which are evaluated using the CORE and EMANE emulation tools. The first uses signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) data to predict the optimal MCS across the network, while the second adjusts algorithm parameters over time using success rate data from all nodes. Our results show that federated learning is able to outperform a baseline of local SINR lookup tables. Based on these results, we propose future steps to practically investigate the effectiveness of federated learning in MANETs."

    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in cyber attacks, Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential for safeguarding computer network security. Most ML-based NIDS rely on either flow-based or packet-based network traffic feature representations. However, flow-based methods may overlook characteristics in individual packets and fail to detect certain attacks. Meanwhile, packet-based methods primarily capture the malicious payload of individual packets, often missing the abnormal correlations between multiple packets, rendering them ineffective against certain types of attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Network Traffic to Image Features (NeTIF)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). NeTIF consists of two steps. The first step is a novel data transformation method that derives image representations of network flows from raw network packets. The second step is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that automatically learns feature representations and patterns for detecting anomalous network flows. Our extensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our NeTIF-based IDS achieves a higher detection rate compared to traditional IDS approaches. Furthermore, our method’s superior performance can be easily explained through plotting intermediate features. This contributes to the model usability and interpretability, which is an increasingly critical aspect in cybersecurity applications."

Conventional traffic systems rely on static timers for functioning and hence present inefficacies, while present energy distribution systems often fail to handle dynamic demand variations and renewable energy integration. In this project, an advanced PLC-based intelligent smart city system is proposed that integrates adaptive traffic management with IoT-based energy load management and AI-based emergency response systems. Traffic lights are controlled variably using infrared sensors, ESP32-CAM vehicle detection systems with ATmega328 processing units integrated with a real-time clock module to facilitate accurate scheduling. At the same time, energy management employs ESP8266 with voltage and current sensors to ensure optimized power allocation among solar panels, storage batteries, and the electrical supply grid with DC-DC converters. An artificial intelligence module predicts congestion and emergency occurrences to enable priority-based allocation of traffic resources as well as energy resources. Aiming to reduce congestion levels, waste energy reduction, and emergency responsiveness improvement to offer a scalable, sustainable, and adaptable infrastructure for future urban city smart cities development."

In this paper, a hybrid parallel timing scheme is introduced. Firstly, the passive residue transfer technique is employed to enable parallel operation of the RA and first stage SAR conversions, thereby lessening the timing burden of the $1^{\\text {st }}$-satge. In addition, the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-stage SAR ADC employs partially parallel conversion to alleviate the timing constraints due to the additional CDAC reset clock and charge-sharing clock introduced by the passive residue transfer. A fully differential ring amplifier is adopted. To improve the process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) robustness of the ring amplifier, a Class-AB biasing scheme is used. The results reveal that the 12-b 1-GS/s ADC achieves 64.8 dB SNDR and 78.1 dB SFDR with the Nyquist input and consumes 26.6 mW at 0.9 V supply. This simulated performance is equivalent to Walden and Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM) of $\\mathbf{1 8. 7 5 ~ f J}$ /conversion-step and 168.8 dB, respectively."

    "abstract": "The key premise of federated learning (FL) is to train ML models across a diverse set of data-owners (clients), without exchanging local data. An overarching challenge to this date is client heterogeneity, which may arise not only from variations in data distribution, but also in data quality, as well as compute/communication latency. An integrated view of these diverse and concurrent sources of heterogeneity is critical; for instance, low-latency clients may have poor data quality, and vice versa. In this work, we propose FLASH (Federated Learning Across Simultaneous Heterogeneities), a lightweight and flexible client selection algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art FL frameworks under extensive sources of heterogeneity, by trading-off the statistical information associated with the client’s data quality, data distribution, and latency. FLASH is the first method, to our knowledge, for handling all these heterogeneities in a unified manner. To do so, FLASH models the learning dynamics through contextual multi-armed bandits (CMAB) and dynamically selects the most promising clients. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLASH achieves substantial and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines—as much as 10% in absolute accuracy—thanks to its unified approach. Importantly, FLASH also outperforms federated aggregation methods that are designed to handle highly heterogeneous settings and even enjoys a performance boost when integrated with them."

    "abstract": "Modern agriculture faces increasing challenges in sustaining productivity due to environmental pressures and limited resources. Traditional crop monitoring, relying on manual observations, often detects stress factors, such as drought, nutrient deficiency, or pest damage, only after significant yield losses have occurred, leading to inefficient resource utilization. To transition from reactive to proactive management, farmers need stress detection systems that can identify early warning signals before they worsen. However, interpreting satellite imagery and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data is technically advanced and often inaccessible to farmers. This paper proposes AgriStream platform suggesting a serverless, cloud-based solution that leverages Sentinel-2 imagery, NDVI computation, and AWS automation for near-real-time vegetation stress detection. The system translates complex geospatial datasets into understandable, implementable insights without requiring specialized infrastructure or expertise. This enables early detection of stress conditions, allowing targeted interventions such as optimized irrigation and fertilization. By empowering farmers with timely, accurate stress monitoring, AgriStream aims to minimize losses, improve resource efficiency, and enhance crop resilience, establishing a scalable solution that supports sustainable agricultural practices."

Traditional convolutional models often rely heavily on handcrafted features or limited receptive fields, which constrain their ability to generalize across diverse atmospheric patterns. This work introduces WeatherViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16)–based architecture designed to perform end-to-end classification of weather images. The proposed system leverages transformer-based attention mechanisms to capture both global and local visual dependencies, enabling more robust feature extraction. Two publicly available weather datasets were combined to form a comprehensive corpus of 14,561 labeled images across 11 weather conditions, including fog, frost, rain, and lightning. Data imbalance was addressed using an inverse-frequency weighted sampling strategy, while data augmentation was applied to enhance diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved a validation accuracy of 95.88%, outperforming single-dataset and augmentation-only baselines. The findings confirm that dataset merging, weighted sampling, and transformer-based architectures significantly improve classification robustness in complex atmospheric scenes. The proposed framework offers a scalable foundation for automated meteorological perception systems."

    "abstract": "As wireless networks evolve toward 5G and 6G, securing communications in dense, dynamic, and potentially adversarial environments becomes increasingly critical. Traditional cryptographic security, relying on symmetric or asymmetric key exchanges at higher layers or pre-provisioning, imposes significant operational complexity—especially in decentralized private networks and tactical deployments where infrastructure is limited and exposure to interception or cryptanalysis is high.This work introduces an environment-aware cryptographic key derivation method that utilizes 5G NR waveforms and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) principles, accompanied by updates to the security frameworks in 5G and next-generation 6G networks. It exploits radio channel reciprocity to extract highly correlated features observable only by legitimate transceivers, while inherently excluding spatially separated eavesdroppers.Our system derives shared secret keys directly from Channel State Information (CSI), achieving high-entropy keys with a 100% agreement rate and a high key generation rate between legitimate nodes. We demonstrate its robustness using software-defined radios operating in the 5G FR1 band, across diverse environments, while constraining the amount of publicly accessible information available to potential eavesdroppers.By embedding geographical awareness, this approach provides a physically secure key generation method, making it well-suited for 5G/6G systems, private networks, and ultra-massive Machine-Type Communication (umMTC) scenarios. The results highlight the potential of physical layer security for future wireless encryption frameworks with design considerations to maximize security and limit eavesdropping feasibility."

Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution feedback that reveals server conditions upon successful or failed job completion. We formulate a cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized training with de-centralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Experiments show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and significantly outperforms baseline strategies across varying query costs, job arrival rates, and dispatchers."

    "abstract": "Healthcare operations are inherently complex, involving dynamic coordination across emergency triage, diagnostics, surgery, and discharge processes. Traditional orchestration methods such as manual scheduling, static bed boards, and siloed communication struggle to manage this complexity, often resulting in delayed interventions, inefficiencies, and suboptimal resource utilization, especially during high-acuity surges or emergencies. Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduces a transformative paradigm by embedding autonomy, reasoning, and negotiation capabilities into intelligent digital agents that perceive, learn, and act within clinical workflows. Unlike conventional AI systems that rely on predefined rules or static predictions, agentic AI employs multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enable decentralized decision-making, adaptive resource allocation, and cooperative policy optimization across interconnected hospital systems. This study presents an autonomous agentic AI framework for clinical workflow orchestration, integrating agents for triage, bed management, laboratory, imaging, transport, and discharge operations. Using HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and DICOM standards, agents exchange real-time information while adhering to governance and safety protocols aligned with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and the EU AI Act. The architecture further incorporates three core design elements: (i) inter-hospital communication for mutual-aid and load sharing, (ii) decentralized ambulance routing that rebalances transport in real time based on dynamic capacity and patient acuity, and (iii) distributed crisis-management protocols for maintaining operational equilibrium during mass-casualty events. Evaluation through digital-twin simulations and shadow-mode deployments demonstrated substantial operational gains, including 60% faster ambulance response, 38% shorter door-to-clinician intervals, and 22% higher operating room throughput. These results confirm that agentic AI transforms reactive, human-initiated workflows into proactive, self-governing systems, enhancing responsiveness, equity, and resilience across healthcare networks."

Efficient energy management in smart homes (SH) is important for achieving minimized electricity cost, better user comfort, and sustainable energy utilization. As SH technologies are evolving, optimizing energy usage has become an essential in reducing costs, improving efficiency, and maintaining user comfort. This work presents an Adaptive Giant Trevally Optimizer (AGTO) based home energy management system (HEMS) that optimizes appliance scheduling on the basis of real time pricing (RTP) models. The AGTO algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by fine-tuned control parameters. Compared to traditional metaheuristic methods, AGTO shows better convergence speed and robustness in avoiding local optima. The proposed AGTO minimizes peak-to-average ratio (PAR), reduces overall cost of electricity, and enhances user comfort by transferring loads from peak to off-peak hours. Simulation outcomes on several residential cases show that AGTO attained approximately 75% cost reduction and 25-61% PAR improvement over other approaches. These outcomes validate AGTO as a robust optimization approach for real-time HEMS and contribute to supportable and cost-efficient energy systems."

The areas that are being turned into urban ones are mainly made of impervious materials such as concrete, asphalt, and glass through which heat is trapped. This is the reason why smaller cities are hotter than the countryside around them. UHIs affect the urban environment in ways such as increased energy demand, poor air quality, thermal discomfort, and climate change becoming more severe. In tropical countries like India, where the base temperature is already high, UHI leads to heat-related illnesses and even more deaths in summer. Although there are many studies that make use of satellite imagery and climatic datasets to analyze the UHIs, traditional methods are still very slow, scattered, and cost-consuming. In this study we integrated artificial intelligence and data analytics and designed a framework for urban heat island mitigation which provides prediction, visualization and recommends various strategies can be adopted for heat management. The different data coming from various sources is merged into a PostGIS spatial database, which not only aligns them geographically but also synchronizes them in time. The data that has been processed first goes through a combined machine learning pipeline that includes Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are used for prediction at the feature level and trend analysis, whereas CNNs are utilized to find the spatial characteristics in the thermal images that lead to the forecasting of temperatures at the pixel level. The model reaches a very strong accuracy of R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.94, which is better than that of traditional regression models."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted network, where an aerial jammer is strategically deployed to mitigate interception attempts by an aerial eavesdropper. To ensure secure and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), an optimization framework is proposed that maximizes the secrecy rate by dynamically adjusting the transmit power, jamming power, and trajectories of legitimate UAVs. To accurately characterize the system’s temporal behavior, a hierarchical time structure is employed, wherein long-term path loss variations and short-term URLLC transmissions are treated independently. The resulting non-convex problem is decomposed into tractable subproblems using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and solved iteratively via successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of this approach in improving the secrecy rate and meeting URLLC constraints under adversarial conditions."

With the growing prevalence of utility-scale PV installations, the inherently variable nature of solar yield necessitates robust prediction models.

This study introduces an approach for predicting solar yield using artificial neural networks (ANNs), exploring various ANN architectures to determine the most suitable structure and comparing its performance against several machine learning models.

    "abstract": "To improve readiness and decrease hazards associated with floods, real-time flood forecasting with data from several sensors is essential. Due to uncertainties in flood quantity, timing, location, and geophysical interactions, complete control of floods remains unattainable. Although conventional flood control methods have been effective in reducing peak elevations and geographic extents, this process have not been able to eradicate floods totally. The suggested research proposes a method for real-time flood prediction that uses deep learning to overcome these shortcomings. Feature extraction through VMD follows the processing of multi-sensor data utilizing power transformations like the Box-Cox transformation and the Gamma Test to choose important input variables. In order to capture the spatial and temporal connections within the data, a CNN-RNN architecture with an attention mechanism is designed. In order to enhance the accuracy of predictions, the RNN models sequential patterns and the CNN extracts spatial characteristics from sensor inputs. The suggested CNN-RNN model is robust and reliable, as shown by the experimental findings, which show a success rate of 99.21 percent. Based on these results, it seems that deep learning integrated with multi-sensor data can greatly improve real-time flood forecasting, which in turn can help with proactive decision-making and better flood risk management."

    "abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies globally due to its silent progression and late-stage diagnosis, resulting in poor survival rates. Conventional diagnostic methods, including endoscopy, biopsy, and imaging, although widely used, are invasive, time-consuming, and heavily relied on the expertise of clinicians, which often leads to diagnostic variability and delays in treatment. To overcome these challenges, this review synthesizes findings from recent studies on intelligent diagnostic systems employing machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), hybrid, and ensemble techniques to facilitate early and accurate detection of EC. These techniques utilise endoscopic images, radiologic scans, and histopathological data to identify early-stage abnormalities, improve diagnostic accuracy, and reduce clinical workload. Also, it examines advancements in intelligent systems, their methodologies, and associated challenges. While the studies have demonstrated notable improvements in lesion detection, staging, and risk stratification, significant gaps persist, including limited dataset diversity, insufficient multicenter validation, lack of interpretability, and difficulty in integrating such systems into real-world clinical workflows. Future directions emphasize the development of explainable AI, incorporation of multimodal data, and real-time adaptive learning frameworks to enhance reliability and clinical trust. Advancing these technologies will enable early, non-invasive, and precise detection of EC, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting personalized treatment strategies."

Virtual honeypots and honeynets enable cyber systems to rapidly create, reconfigure, and take down decoy nodes in order to maximize the effectiveness of the deception. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for dynamic decoy placement. In contrast to existing game-theoretic methodologies that focus on static decoy placement, our framework formulates dynamic strategies that modify the decoy locations in response to suspicious network activity. In order to solve the game, we propose a reinforcement learning approach for computing an optimal decoy placement policy. We mitigate the computational complexity by exploiting submodular structure of the value function of the game, which enables provable optimality bounds using a sequential greedy approximation at each time step. We conduct a numerical study that demonstrates our approach is tractable for a 100-node grid network and significantly improves win probability while reducing resource cost compared to a static decoy placement algorithm."

In this era of artificial intelligence (AI), there are novel avenues to detecting mental health conditions by leveraging AI, which can be used to create scalable and convenient supportive communities. The AI-based mental health detection system introduced in this work employs Mental RoBERTa to monitor user interactions and detect early signs of mental unease such as stress, anxiety and depression. The system is based on concept of a customizable modular application that consists of a report in the reporting engine, a time psychological screening module and the March Bot Controller, which is used to interact with the patient during a session. It is the feature selection that optimizes the data dimensionality within this model to achieve, for effective mental health prediction, high precision and relevancy of detected relations. Experiments show that our approach is promising, yielding stable information and achieving above 85% in classification accuracy. Some users liked the chat flow on the app as it had been described to be supportive, encourage openness and reduce stigma. That the disjuncture between people and professional mental health care can be bridged by reported feeling, applied feel, can serve as a low-cost Judgment of risk tool offering the model and first phase in early detection. For wider use in monitoring and support for mental health, research will focus on further tweaking the model, broadening the range of data it can be trained on, and addressing ethical issues. This study also demonstrates how AI is a game-changer in fulfilling unmet needs in global mental health care."

The architecture proposed is based on a two-step coordinated control process, with the first step using an adaptive P&O MPPT control algorithm to optimize power extraction using the solar array and the second step using a dual mode CC/CV control loop to maintain charging current and voltage as a function of battery state of charge (SOC). The converter is defined and designed in MATLAB/ Simulink 2021a and the performance of the system is evaluated with variable irradiance and load conditions. As the simulation results prove, the given system has 96.1% of conversion efficiency, settling time of 0.13 s, steady-state error of 0.9, and reduction of the voltage ripple of 41.9% in relation to the traditional PI-controlled converters. The adaptive P&O algorithm removes steady-state oscillations and enhances the tracking accuracy by about 4 percent and CC/CV control enables the smooth transition between charging modes without overshoot or current spikes. The combination of both control phases has better dynamic control, energy efficiency and voltage stability. These findings show that the proposed two-stage system is effective in the application of renewable-integrated EV charging and can be flexible in respect to smart grid environments."

    "abstract": "Routing in multi-hop wireless networks is a complex problem, especially in heterogeneous networks where multiple wireless communication technologies coexist. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been introduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based on local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and poor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or dynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with diverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep Q-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability and adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate the Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication technology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN, selecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only defines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN. To this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel gain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an improved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the model experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and robustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node selection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that the DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs comparably to the optimal approach."

To address this problem, we propose UR-HDRL (UAV network Reconfiguration based on Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that adopts a hierarchical architecture to decouple safety constraints from communication performance optimization. The algorithm integrates Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to ensure safety and enhance collaborative decision-making in environments with obstacles. Experimental results indicate that UR-HDRL achieves significant improvements in data transmission efficiency, network coverage, and collision avoidance compared with baseline methods. The results also reveal distinct differences between communication coverage and sensing coverage, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between them."

Despite the SSR results achieved by existing deep unfolding networks (DUNs), they still face challenges in: 1) recovering the fine-grained and realistic details; 2) suppressing the spectral distortion. Diffusion model has advantages in generating diverse and realistic contents, while its fidelity is limited due to the inherent randomness. In this study, to reconstruct a faithful and realistic HSI, we integrate the diffusion model in DUN, and propose a degradation-aware unrolling diffusion model for SSR (deDiff-SSR). The generative diffusion prior is jointly leveraged with the spectral degradation and deep prior learning. Specifically, we first pre-train a channel attention enhanced denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), the spectral correlation is exploited for learning the diffusion prior of HSI. To aware the degradation, by optimizing a diffusion and deep priors regularized HSI SSR model, we propose a degradation-aware diffusion sampling method, the spectral degradation is learned to refine each diffusion sampling step. Via unrolling the degradation-aware diffusion sampling steps, we build the deDiff-SSR network. It contains diffusion and deep proximal operators to represent the diffusion and deep priors, respectively. We implement the diffusion proximal operator with one sampling step of the pre-trained DDPM. Moreover, we design a state-space Transformer as the deep proximal operator, the spectral-spatial long-range relationship of HSI can be efficiently captured. The experiments on several indoor and remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of deDiff-SSR."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the prevalence of modern flight data sensing systems, represented by Quick Access Recorder (QAR), has made it viable to improve flight safety by analyzing massive flight parameters. However, existing studies predominantly concentrate on predefined safety events where the expert-annotated data are highly scarce and imbalanced. In this paper, we address this issue by uncovering abnormal flight patterns from tremendous unlabeled data to discover potential and unexpected safety risks. To this end, we propose DUVET, a reconstruction-based DUal View Enhanced Transformer model for flight data anomaly detection, which plays a vital role in aviation safety monitoring. Specifically, DUVET adopts patching and channel independence techniques to reduce model parameters and improve Transformer’s computational efficiency while preserving its semantic representation capacity. Based on the observation that flight safety risks usually relate to both long-term trend and short-term patterns, we creatively propose Flight Trend-Aware Attention and Bell attention mechanisms to capture both global and local dependencies, enhancing the model reconstruction ability. We evaluate DUVET on six public real-world datasets and one QAR dataset, demonstrating that DUVET achieves state-of-the-art performance in general time series anomaly detection task. Further experiments on the QAR dataset show that DUVET meets key criteria of anomaly detection for flight safety in terms of stability, training efficiency and detection accuracy. Case study shows that DUVET can effectively uncover hidden flight safety risks."

It features a unique single rotary joint that enables rapid transformation into an ultranarrow profile. Although quadrotors have seen widespread adoption in applications, such as cinematography, agriculture, and disaster management, with increasingly sophisticated control systems, their hardware configurations have remained largely unchanged, limiting their capabilities in certain environments. Our design addresses this by enabling the hardware configuration to change on the fly when required. In standard flight mode, the MorphoCopter adopts an <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X</i> configuration, functioning as a traditional quadcopter, but can quickly fold into a stacked bicopters arrangement or any configuration in between. Existing morphing designs often sacrifice controllability in compact configurations or rely on complex multijoint systems. Moreover, our design achieves a greater width reduction than any existing solution. We develop a new inertia and control-action aware adaptive control system that maintains robust performance across all rotary-joint configurations. The prototype can reduce its width from 447 to 138 mm (nearly 70% reduction) in just a few seconds. We validated the MorphoCopter through rigorous simulations and a comprehensive series of flight experiments, including robustness tests, trajectory tracking, and narrow-gap passing tests."

    "abstract": "Cross-scene hyperspectral image (HSI) classification plays a vital role in a variety of applications, including agricultural monitoring, military reconnaissance, and urban planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of land-cover characteristics, the diversity of scenes, and the distribution shifts caused by variations in acquisition conditions or sensors, deep HSI open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) has emerged as a key approach to tackling cross-scene HSI classification. Existing methods assume identical joint distributions between training and test data. However, this rigorous assumption renders them ineffective in real-world scenes when encountering varied sensors, changed imaging conditions, different spatial resolution in HSI imaging, e.g., water vapor bands at 1.36-1.39 μm. To address this, we propose a more generalizable deep HSI OSDA method JDMUS based on Joint Distribution Matching and unknown class Uncertainty Suppression, for cross-scene HSI classification. Specifically, we employ χ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-divergence to characterize the joint distribution discrepancy and propose a least-squares χ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-divergence estimator without explicitly modeling the two joint distributions, yielding a quadratic problem with an analytical solution. Furthermore, we prove the methodology that the upper bound of the target error for neural network classification model is determined by the average source error, χ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-divergence, and open-set risk difference. Based on this methodology, we design joint distribution matching and unknown class uncertainty suppression mechanisms, and thus construct the JDMUS algorithm with theoretical guarantees, in which weighted generative adversarial network with dynamic thresholding is used for feature extraction. Experiments on cross-scene HSI datasets demonstrate that our JDMUS outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches."

The chaotic phase noise is transformed onto the intensity axis by the FrFT., thus masks the intensity modulated messages. The proposed architecture achieves physical-layer security enhancement through asynchronous chaos modulation, bypassing the explicit synchronization constraints inherent in conventional chaotic encryption paradigms. By varying the control parameters of the FrFT with an external pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS), certain attacks against the FrFT can be immuned. The FrFT parameters and the PRBS are covered by the chaotic phase noise signal which make the eavesdropper difficult to crack the system. Decoupling chaotic entropy generation from optical transmission layers allows independent optimization of broadband photonic noise sources, while enabling plug-and-play security module integration through standardized FrFT operator interfaces."

However, it has also increased the cyber-security and privacy risks for the grids. This article introduces a new way to improve the security and privacy of smart power systems through an adaptive intrusion detection mechanism. This mechanism is designed to tackle the specific challenges that CPS environments present, using real-time data processing and adaptive intrusion detection mechanisms. It can effectively identify both known and new cyber threats with high accuracy. A strong method is outlined to enhance the detection and reduction of false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that target smart power grids. This approach helps identify targeted attacks, even when anomalies are minimal, thereby ensuring better system resilience, operational stability, and data privacy protection. This adaptive framework offers a promising solution to boost the resilience of CPS in power systems. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is assessed using IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 39-bus, and 118-bus systems in the MATLAB (R2023b) environment. It measures resilience and privacy leakage caused by FDIA in two scenarios: delayed detection with high residual values and timely detection with low residual values. The simulation results showcase the effectiveness of this strategy for secure grid operation."

    "abstract": "Reliable fault diagnosis of DC-DC converters is critical for ensuring the safety and operational continuity of electric vehicles (EVs) and industrial power systems. In practical applications, early detection of progressive degradation can prevent catastrophic failures and significantly reduce maintenance costs. However, developing robust diagnostic models is hindered by sensor noise, environmental disturbances, and the scarcity of labeled fault data—particularly for subtle degradation scenarios where real-world collection is expensive. To address these issues, this paper proposes a transfer learning framework based on Inception-Residual Neural Network (ResNet) + One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), aiming to enhance diagnostic performance under small-sample conditions. The proposed network extracts discriminative features from simulated voltage signals (source domain) and transfers this knowledge to real-world experimental data (target domain). To reduce domain discrepancies, a Whitening and Coloring Covariance Alignment (WCA) is employed for global feature alignment, while a novel Classwise WCA strategy further refines the alignment at the category level to preserve fault-specific structures. Additionally, the classifier is fine-tuned using L2 Starting Point (L2-SP) regularization, which constrains parameter shift to prevent overfitting under limited supervision. The method is non-intrusive and practical, operating efficiently using only the output voltage ripple. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating a diagnostic accuracy of 91.6% even with limited samples, significantly outperforming conventional transfer learning methods in cross-domain fault identification tasks."

Existing deep learning methods often lack accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes WECI-YOLO, an enhanced algorithm based on YOLO11n. The backbone network integrates a C3k2-WTConv module to widen the receptive field. A lightweight EUCB module is embedded in the upsampling path to improve multi-level feature fusion. For elongated defects, a C2PSA-CAA attention module is designed to optimize extraction. Additionally, the Inner-SIoU loss function combines SIoU’s angle perception with Inner-IoU’s internal scaling strategy. Experiments on the GC10-DET and Aug-GC10-DET datasets demonstrate that WECI-YOLO achieves recall rates of 65.8% and 66.5%, respectively, along with mean average precision (mAP) values of 66.6% and 67.9%. Compared to YOLO11n, recall improved by 2.4% and 2.5%, while precision increased by 4.0% and 3.6%, achieving optimal performance on Aug-GC10-DET. The impacts of augmentation and the proposed modules are evaluated separately in the experiments.Notably, these accuracy gains are achieved with only a small and acceptable increase in computational cost.

CAPE uses the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) to create an excess-power map of the neighborhood that is shared with neighbors to reduce the transmit power to accommodate the highest-path-loss neighbor. We present extensive simulation results on CAPE’s performance on a model of the goTenna mesh network. Our results show that CAPE reduces energy by 29% - 70%, and visibility by 28% - 64%, depending on the density of the network and the CAPE variant used.

By dynamically routing inputs to specialized sub-models, MoE architectures efficiently capture diverse signal behaviors while maintaining computational scalability.

Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown immense promise in analyzing medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) scans. However, performance can vary significantly based on model architecture and the specific diagnostic task. This paper presents a comprehensive, multi-task comparative study of five distinct CNN architectural families for lung cancer analysis. We evaluate these models on three separate, well-defined tasks: (1) multi-class nodule classification, (2) semantic nodule segmentation, and (3) binary malignancy classification. The architectures benchmarked include legacy models (VGG-16), residual networks (ResNet-50), densely connected networks (DenseNet-121), mobile-optimized networks (MobileNet-V2), and modern efficient networks (EfficientNet-B0). Our findings demonstrate that model suitability is highly task-dependent. EfficientNet-B0 overwhelmingly outperforms all other models in the primary multi-class classification task, achieving an Accuracy of 98.8% while utilizing significantly fewer computational resources. In contrast, a U-Net architecture utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder provides the most robust results for nodule segmentation, suggesting that architectural depth is critical for spatial feature preservation. Furthermore, we conduct a computational complexity analysis, revealing that modern architectures reduce parameter counts by up to 96% compared to legacy models without compromising accuracy. This study underscores the importance of architectural selection for specific clinical applications and provides a rigorous baseline for future work in automated lung cancer diagnostics."

The current work looks at the use of varying degrees of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize predictive maintenance for various logistics assets, including vehicles, conveyors, storage units, and other fleet management systems. The work outlines the various components of a system that deploys predictive maintenance. It describes system architecture, various types of data that need to be collected, and a combination of high end neural networks and deep reinforcement learning. The work also describes the lack of deployed AI systems, or operational black boxes, within the operational domain of predictive maintenance, and how to overcome these to create truly operational predictive maintenance systems. Numerous case studies within the work illustrate the operational benefits of PdM, including the reduction of unplanned downtimes, the better deployment of assets, the reduction of operational costs, enhanced resiliency within the entire supply chain; all interlaced with the positive environmental impacts of AI systems within logistics. The work concludes with a description of the remaining research gaps and added components of geographically located networked information systems within intra-logistics systems."

    "abstract": "Traditional electromagnetic design automation (EDA) methods for frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) are computationally expensive and inefficient for complex designs. Neural network-based surrogate models have been introduced to accelerate the process, but conventional architectures struggle to accurately predict electromagnetic responses due to limited frequency-dependent feature extraction. To address this, we propose a Multi-Branch Autoencoder (MBAE) framework that separately encodes structural and frequency-domain features, significantly improving predictive accuracy. The integration of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) enhances the model’s ability to learn complex electromagnetic behaviors, while an adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm improves global optimization. Experimental results show that our method achieves the target frequency response ($19.5-25 \\mathrm{GHz}$) in just seven iterations, delivering a $58 \\times-117 \\times$ speedup over full-wave simulations and a $152.8 \\times$ acceleration per iteration compared to manual optimization. Notably, it outperforms conventional neural networks in predictive accuracy, providing a more efficient and scalable solution for advanced electromagnetic design."

The proposed method is rigorously compared against a seminal classic flocking model and two advanced MPC-based strategies that incorporate lattice-structured cost functions. Through a series of statistical hypothesis tests, we demonstrate that the proposed approach reliably achieves the target lattice configuration, ensures convergence to a common velocity, and prevents collisions with both obstacles and neighboring agents. The results show that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, offering superior performance and reliability for multi-agent systems modeled as omnidirectional four-wheeled robots."

First, the range-velocity (r-v) response of the received signal is obtained by the conventional matched filter to detect multiple targets and estimate r-v value of each target. Then, the estimated range value with error due to the beam squint effect and the offgrid problem causes serious performance degradation in direction of arrival (DoA) estimation. To solve issues, we propose the DoA estimation method considering the beam squint effect, which compensates for the range error and estimates the exact DoA by the gradient descent method. As a result, the proposed method improves the DoA estimation performance by overcoming the beam-squint effect and the off-grid problem."

The SCADA systems are the backbone of process automation. To take it a notch further, we integrated a feature that sends data about the power system under SCADA's control to the relevant mobile phone via GSM. Any digital information pertaining to any process automation developed with digital electronics may be automatically sent to any chosen mobile phone anywhere in the globe, thanks to the flexible and modern technology of GSM-based project activities. The primary goal of a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is to digitize the analogue data from any power system's many channels, maintain constant watch over all information channels, automatically display the digital data from each channel by selecting the appropriate channel, and safeguard the power system through the implementation of control actions. [4]-[7] Complex devices that need constant vigilance and immediate response from operators greatly benefit from SCADA systems like this. There has been a lot of interest in SCADA systems, and almost every industry is trying to find ways to improve their operations with more sophisticated systems. As a result, we settled on this project's tasks and, to demonstrate our theory in practice, we built a single SCADA system for the power grid. Here, a single power transformer serves as a stand-in for an entire power system. A number of parameters pertaining to this transformer are continuously monitored, converted, and shown digitally. Additionally, control actions are put in place to prevent the transformer from overheating for a variety of reasons. Lastly, all of this data is automatically sent to a chosen mobile phone."

Comprehensive electrical characterization was conducted through systematic comparison of output characteristics, transfer characteristics, and capacitance-voltage measurements before and after treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel approach. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key device parameters following supercritical fluid nitriding treatment. The saturation drain current increased by approximately 100% at the highest gate voltage level, while transconductance characteristics showed enhanced gate control efficiency and carrier transport properties. The on-resistance decreased from $1270 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega$ to $1090 \\mathrm{~m} \\Omega$, representing a 14% reduction in conduction losses. Capacitance-voltage measurements revealed reduced hysteresis and improved curve symmetry, confirming lower interface trap density and enhanced interface quality. The treatment process demonstrated excellent compatibility with existing fabrication technologies while maintaining gate oxide integrity. These findings establish supercritical fluid nitriding as a promising low-temperature approach for addressing the fundamental interface quality challenges in SiC MOSFET technology, offering significant potential for advancing wide-bandgap semiconductor applications in power electronics."

Abnormalities in the nails are subject to variability as they can be examined by hand and hence the necessity of automated and reliable diagnostic instruments. This paper introduces a computer-assisted nail disease classification system on the basis of deep learning with a fine-tuned EfficientNetB3 architecture, achieved with the help of the strength of transfer learning and compound scaling to improve feature extraction. The data includes 3,835 photos that belong to six categories, i. e. Acral Lentiginous Melanoma, Healthy Nail, Onychogryphosis, Blue Finger, Clubbing, and Pitting. Such preprocessing as resizing, normalization, and massive data augmentation were used to ensure sound training. To preserve generic visual features and fine-tune the upper layers to learn task-specific patterns, the EfficientNetB3 model was modified by freezing the lower convolutional layers, and a new classification head which included Global Average Pooling layer, dense ReLU activation, dropout, and softmax output had been implemented. The model was trained and verified with adoption of AdamW as an optimizer and categorical cross-entropy losses and early termination in preventing overfitting. The results of the experiments provided evidence that the suggested framework reached a total accuracy of 96% and equal precision, recall, and F1-scores of all the classes. These results illustrate why the fine-tuned EfficientNetB3 model is a successful predictor of nail disease to be used as a dependable automated nail disease detection tool and provide the opportunities to implement it into clinical diagnostics and telemedicine systems."

These restrictions hinder the promotion and monitoring of lesser-known heritage sites and lower cultural engagement.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for effective spectrum management and interference mitigation in shared bands, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), requires robust radar detection algorithms to protect the military transmission from interference due to commercial wireless transmission. These algorithms, in turn, depend on large, diverse, and carefully labeled spectrogram datasets. However, collecting and annotating real-world radio frequency (RF) spectrogram data remains a significant challenge, as radar signals are rare, and their occurrences are infrequent. This challenge makes the creation of balanced datasets difficult, limiting the performance and generalizability of AI models in this domain. To address this critical issue, we propose a diffusion-based generative model for synthesizing realistic and diverse spectrograms of five distinct categories that integrate LTE, 5G, and radar signals within the CBRS band. We conduct a structural and statistical fidelity analysis of the generated spectrograms using widely accepted evaluation metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), to quantify their divergence from the training data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pre-training on the generated spectrograms significantly improves training efficiency on a real-world radar detection task by enabling 51.5% faster convergence."

To enhance focus on significant tumor regions, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)–based CNN model is developed as an intermediate improvement. Finally, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated with the CNN to form the proposed model, which adaptively refines feature maps by emphasizing relevant areas while suppressing background noise. The models were trained and validated on a brain MRI dataset collected from Kaggle.

This novel approach replaces the standard equalization and estimates both the transmitted data and the channel without the knowledge of any prior distributions, by making use of only one pilot.

Multi-scale analysis is applied to derive internal resonance conditions. The analytical model further reveals how excitation parameters influence the nonlinear behavior of the resonator.

    "abstract": "Electronic Support (ES) relies on intercept receivers to gain situational awareness of emitters operating in the electromagnetic environment. Due to sensitivity and Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints, the receive bandwidth of intercept receivers is typically smaller than the total bandwidth of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum to be monitored. Consequently, ES intercept receivers rely on scheduling algorithms that dictate which frequency band to monitor and when. Traditional schedulers rely on knowledge of emitters expected in the electromagnetic environment and their operating characteristics. However, reliable intelligence on emitters is not always available. In this paper, we present a machine-learning (ML) based approach with a focus on intercepting periodic-scan emitters. We use Double Deep-Q-Networks (Double DQN), a form of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), to develop a model-free neural-network-based receiver scheduler. We train and test the scheduler on simulated electromagnetic environments based on realistic emitters. We analyse the interception performance of our scheduler over various scenarios, using test parameters within and out-of-range of our model’s training parameters. The results show that our ML-based scheduler is capable of developing a robust schedule across emitters with different transmission characteristics. Unlike traditional schedulers, our ML-based scheduling technique does not require prior knowledge of emitter characteristics."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates intelligent energy management systems to optimize charging efficiency, reduce costs, and extend battery lifespan. This paper presents a novel hybrid ensemble framework that combines gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for multi-objective optimization of EV charging energy management. We developed an advanced feature engineering pipeline incorporating 24 temporal-spatial features and conducted comprehensive comparative analysis across 11 machine learning algorithms using a dataset of 1,320 real-world charging sessions. The proposed Hybrid Ensemble model achieved exceptional performance with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score of 0.9897 for energy consumption prediction and 0.8478 for charging cost prediction, representing a 0.65% improvement over traditional Random Forest baselines. The framework incorporates multi-target prediction capabilities for simultaneous optimization of energy consumption, charging cost, duration, and efficiency. Feature importance analysis revealed that temperature efficiency, battery capacity, and charging rate are the most critical factors influencing energy consumption. The system also includes an intelligent recommendation module for personalized charging strategies. The results demonstrate that hybrid ensemble approaches combining tree-based gradient boosting with deep learning significantly outperform individual algorithms, achieving RMSE of 2.17 kWh and MAE of 1.45 kWh for energy prediction. This research contributes to sustainable transportation by enabling more efficient EV charging infrastructure management and provides a scalable framework for real-time energy optimization in smart grid applications."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed explosive growth in the deployment of IoT devices over tactical edge networks, which demand flexible task offloading strategies to accommodate limited connectivity and computing resources. While many existing works assume direct access to edge servers, such assumptions often break down in adversarial and dynamic environments. This work introduces a novel edge task offloading framework that enables multi-hop communication and enables task execution not only at edge servers but also at relay nodes and local devices. We formulate the problem of joint task offloading, resource allocation, and time frame/slot assignment, under a timedivision multiple access (TDMA) uplink scheme, as a nonlinear integer program to maximize total rewards, subject to various communication and resource constraints. To solve it optimally, we first construct a feasibility-aware directed graph that captures valid communication links based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, and then design a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that integrates slot-minimizing offloading path selection with the assignment of the largest feasible number of time frames for each user to reduce total time slots consumption without violating task completion deadlines. To improve scalability, efficient heuristics are developed using scaling and rounding techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DP algorithm achieves optimal task offloading and resource allocation, while our heuristic algorithms offer a computationally efficient alternative with competitive performance."

    "abstract": "The Y1 interface in O-RAN enables the sharing of RAN Analytics Information (RAI) between the near-RT RIC and authorized Y1 consumers, which may be internal applications within the operator’s trusted domain or external systems accessing data through a secure exposure function. While this visibility enhances network optimization and enables advanced services, it also introduces a potential security risk – a malicious or compromised Y1 consumer could misuse analytics to facilitate targeted interference. In this work, we demonstrate how an adversary can exploit the Y1 interface to launch selective jamming attacks by passively monitoring downlink metrics. We propose and evaluate two Y1-aided jamming strategies: a clustering-based jammer leveraging DBSCAN for traffic profiling and a threshold-based jammer. These are compared against two baselines strategies – always-on jammer and random jammer – on an over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed. Experimental results show that in unconstrained jamming budget scenarios, the threshold-based jammer can closely replicate the disruption caused by always-on jamming while reducing transmission time by 27%. Under constrained jamming budgets, the clustering-based jammer proves most effective, causing up to an 18.1% bitrate drop while remaining active only 25% of the time. These findings reveal a critical trade-off between jamming stealthiness and efficiency, and illustrate how exposure of RAN analytics via the Y1 interface can enable highly targeted, low-overhead attacks, raising important security considerations for both civilian and mission-critical O-RAN deployments."

This nonstationary tends to obscure fault-related information in industrial systems, posing severe challenges for quality-related fault detection. This article proposes a method named reversible instance normalization temporal autoencoder (TAE) canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for quality related fault detection. First, this method quantifies the interdependencies among variables to select process variables that are highly correlated with quality indicators. Subsequently, a reversible normalization module dynamically adjusts normalization parameters to achieve local stationarization of process data. Furthermore, a TAE is utilized to extract temporal features from processed data. Then, a CCA model is established by integrating quality indicators, enabling efficient monitoring of quality indicator under nonstationary conditions. Finally, the proposed method was tested and validated in two real industrial cases."

In this paper, various fault-tolerant dc-dc converters proposed with active and inactive redundancy are reviewed and compared to gain an understanding of the prominent solutions. Guidelines for the selection of a fuse are presented with computation for various input switching current waveforms. Various fault-tolerant configuration with active redundancy is derived and discussed. Multiport DC–DC converters inherently exhibit fault-tolerant characteristics owing to the availability and flexible utilization of multiple input sources. This paper presents an overview of selected converter topologies in which component-level redundancy is strategically employed to enhance reliability and fault tolerance. In addition, relevant IEEE and IEC codes and standards for diverse applications are examined, with a particular focus on protection and safety requirements. This study also emphasizes the need of proactive adherence to standards and codes to address the protection mechanisms and avoid fault occurrences, thereby ensuring reliable operation. Moreover, the study identifies the fault-prone elements within critical power-conditioning converter components. Experimental results of a fault-tolerant quadratic boost converter with 2-level redundancy are presented. This article will offer valuable design guidelines for researchers working in this area to enhance the reliability of high-gain dc-dc converters.

    "abstract": "Cooperative positioning enhances localization accuracy in intelligent artifact swarms through shared measurements, especially in environments such as urban canyons or disaster zones. Dynamic topologies, heterogeneous measurements, and scalability demands create complex challenges for state estimation. This paper introduces MRCA, the first comprehensive framework unifying heterogeneous measurements, reasoning processes, environment cognition, and scenario-based applications for cooperative positioning. The four-layer architecture comprises: i) the Measurement block converts signals into measurement parameters in a standard format independent of sensor types and measurement methods; ii) the Reasoning block uncovers the underlying principles of state transition using a four reasoning elements; iii) the Cognition block underscores the importance of node-environment interactions by identifying new valid radiation sources and verifying the ongoing validity of existing ones; iv) the Application block offers users task-driven cooperative positioning services, like execute potential navigation actions. Our proposed framework demonstrates performance improvements in various key metrics compared to legacy swarm positioning algorithms. Focusing on the framework itself, we employ the most basic algorithms within each block, and the experimental results are as follows: In scenarios featuring static unknown anchors, sparse perception, and collision interference, MRCA reduces cumulative positioning error by over 51% for dead-reckoning and 39% for traditional distributed cooperative positioning, while reducing average orientation error by over 31% and 27%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Accurate and objective assessment of rehabilitation exercises is critical for ensuring correct execution and maximizing patient recovery, particularly in unsupervised or home-based settings. Existing deep learning approaches frequently rely on graph-based skeletal representations with predefined topologies, which constrain the discovery of long-range or task-specific joint dependencies and limit adaptability across datasets with varying skeletal definitions. To address these limitations, we propose a Spatial–Temporal Transformer framework that directly models 3D joint position data without requiring an explicit adjacency matrix. The framework incorporates a joint-wise feature encoding and structure embedding mechanism to provide unique representations for each joint, thereby mitigating ambiguities arising from symmetry or overlapping movements. Furthermore, a stochastic time-warping augmentation strategy is introduced to simulate execution speed variations, enhancing robustness to diverse patient movement patterns. By applying small, randomized temporal scaling to local segments while consistently interpolating spatial coordinates within temporal boundaries, this stochastic variation enriches the dataset significantly while preserving the biomechanical patterns. Experimental results on the KIMORE dataset demonstrate that the proposed method reduces mean absolute deviation (MAD) by 67.4 % relative to the current state of the art, while also maintaining strong generalization on the UI-PRMD dataset. The approach is compatible with multiple pose estimation algorithms and acquisition modalities, making it suitable for deployment in real-world telerehabilitation and clinical monitoring applications."

However, their effective application to 3D volumetric segmentation remains largely underexplored, especially concerning optimal adaptation strategies for transferring 2D pretrained knowledge to the structurally disparate 3D domain. To address this, we present a comprehensive investigation into the transferability and task-specific adaptability of six diverse 2D VFMs (including Self- Supervised, Vision-Language, and Segmentation Generalists) for 3D medical image segmentation. We systematically evaluate four distinct transfer learning paradigms, including advanced Fine-Tuning methods, across four heterogeneous 3D medical datasets. Our results establish VFMs as a powerful and cost-effective generalist baseline, consistently outperforming non-pretrained and standard 3D ViT architectures despite the substantial domain shift. Crucially, our systematic exploration reveals that parameter-efficient finetuning achieves the highest segmentation accuracy across all datasets. Feature-level analyses using PCA and CKA provide key insights, confirming that optimal performance stems from successfully balancing the preservation of generalizable low-level visual features with the adaptation of high-level, task-specific semantics."

These challenges often lead to inaccurate boundary delineation and misclassification of small objects. To address these limitations, ScaleRSNet is proposed, a novel deep learning architecture designed to handle multi-scale objects through a hierarchical multi-scale feature learning framework. ScaleRSNet integrates a hierarchical encoder, multi-scale contextual aggregation, spatial feature transformation, and a cross-layer fusion decoder. The hierarchical encoder employs dilated convolutions with progressively increasing dilation rates to capture fine-grained details and broader context across multiple scales. Spatial attention mechanisms selectively enhance discriminative features and refine segmentation boundaries for small or fragmented objects. Experimental results demonstrate that ScaleRSNet achieves 69.62% mPA and 82.16% accuracy on the WHDLD dataset, representing improvements of 19.09% in mPA and 10.88% in accuracy compared to the baseline UNet. On the EarthVQA dataset, ScaleRSNet achieves 45.65% mPA and 60.02% accuracy, representing improvements of 20.15% in mPA and 22.24% in accuracy compared to UNet.

    "abstract": "Cooperative localization is an essential task in multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, especially in environments with partial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denial. By effectively integrating low-precision Inertial Navigation System (INS)-derived priors, inter-UAV relative distances, and sparse anchor-based measurements, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) can be employed for UAV localization. However, localization accuracy suffers under nonlinear dynamics and inaccurate knowledge of process and measurement noise statistics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Structurally-Integrated Attention Kalman Filter called SIA-KalmanNet for accurate and robust state estimation. By combining state-space models with attention-based neural networks in the Kalman flow, the estimator preserves the data efficiency and interpretability of traditional model-driven methods while implicitly learning second-order covariance matrices from data. Specifically, two networks are devised to learn the Kalman gain: the Self-Attention Residual Masked Network (SA-RMN) and the Self-Cross Attention Residual Masked Network (SCA-RMN). Among them, SA-RMN is a lightweight network for end-to-end state estimation. SCA-RMN introduces masked cross-attention to adaptively fuse forward state features and backward historical correction information to obtain a more precise state estimate. Furthermore, a practical training strategy based on sliding window and causal masking is developed to ensure efficient training and real-time inference. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior localization performance compared to the traditional EKF and KalmanNets. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness against INS drift and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)-induced distance errors, even in harsh environments where only a limited number of UAVs can access GNSS signals."

In response, this study proposes a selection hyper-heuristic framework for time-dependent green logistics, incorporating key factors such as economic costs, carbon emissions, rider types, real-time traffic conditions, and time-window constraints. To address the complexities introduced by these real-world factors, we design a two-layer distribution model with crowdsourced delivery that covers the flow from city distribution centers to regional hubs and ultimately to end customers. The first layer involves location selection and the delivery process, while the second layer focuses on order allocation and last-mile delivery. For the location selection and order allocation problems, exact optimization models are developed to obtain high-quality solutions. In the delivery process, we integrate Deep Reinforcement Learning to replace the traditional adaptive layer of the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm, enabling dynamic and intelligent adjustments during the search. Comparative analyses against existing and traditional methods across various benchmark instances demonstrate the superior efficiency and solution quality of the proposed framework. Simulation experiments based on a real-world road network in China validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Completing UAV patrol missions requires determining an optimal sequence for visiting task points and planning feasible paths to ensure the UAV safety in the presence of diverse peaks, valleys, and infeasible regions in mountainous environments. To address these issues, we propose a dual-population evolution-based collaborative optimization algorithm (DECOA) for coordinated UAV mission patrol, encompassing both UAV task assignment and path planning, in mountainous environments. First, we design a comprehensive model to represent mountainous environments accurately. Then, DECOA is proposed to address the UAV mission patrol optimization problem using a population-evolution framework applied to the constructed model. In DECOA, two distinct particle encoding schemes are introduced to efficiently convert task assignment and path planning solutions in UAV mission patrol models into representations suitable for optimization processing. Additionally, a dynamic dual-population search strategy is devised to balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. To enhance the global search capability of DECOA in promising regions, an adaptive collaboration mechanism is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of DECOA, various scenarios are designed to conduct extensive experiments, focusing on UAV task assignment, path planning, and coordinated mission patrol. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and validate the effectiveness of the designed test scenarios."

Based on above two techniques, a reduction of 99.48% in switching energy and 75% in the number of capacitors has been achieved. The presented method exhibits a DNL of 0.162 LSB and an INL of 0.167LSB."

    "abstract": "In cross-domain recommendation tasks, user behavior exhibits complex characteristics of the dynamism, nonlinearity, and heterogeneity across different platforms. Therefore, addressing the difficulty of accurately modeling user interest migration and evolution under the single-domain assumption of traditional recommendation algorithms, this paper proposes a cross-domain user interest modeling system based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), named SmartTarget-Algo. This system employs a dual-channel hybrid structure, collaboratively capturing short-term behavioral changes and long-term interest preferences in both sequential and unordered dependency layers. Furthermore, as an innovation, a Multi-View Hypergraph Convolution (MV-HGC) mechanism is introduced to model higher-order coupling relationships across domains. This innovation enables the diffusion and migration of interest features across different domains. Simultaneously, the model designs a location-aware dynamic attention mechanism, adaptively adjusting user interest weights in both temporal and semantic dimensions. This operation enhances the model's ability to express multi-level semantic associations. During the inference phase, SmartTarget-Algo generates cross-domain interest score vectors through multi-hop neighborhood diffusion and hyperedge aggregation. This fusion modeling achieves globally consistent interest structure modeling. This paper conducts large-scale comparative experiments on three composite datasets: Edu-Shop, Video-News, and Music-Travel. Performance comparisons with six benchmark algorithms are also performed to verify the overall performance. Experimental results show that SmartTarget-Algo achieves significant improvements across all evaluation metrics. Specifically, compared to sequence recommendation models GRU4Rec and SASRec, it improves HR@10 and NDCG@10 by approximately 9.3% and 6.8%, respectively. Compared to graph structure models GC-SR, HGNN-Cross, and SeHGNN, it improves MRR and AUC by 3.5% and 3.2%, respectively. Furthermore, in sparse user scenarios, SmartTarget-Algo achieves a 31.6% improvement in HR@10. Performance tests show that model has approximately 10.4M parameters and a forward inference latency of 18.5 ms in a single-card V100 environment."

    "abstract": "Much recent research on multi-target tracking has focused on multi-hypothesis approaches leveraging random finite sets. Of particular interest are labeled random finite set methods that maintain temporally coherent labels for each object. While these methods enjoy important theoretical properties as closed-form solutions to the multi-target Bayes filter, the maintenance of multiple hypotheses under the standard measurement model is highly computationally expensive, even when hypothesis pruning approximations are applied. In this work, we focus on the Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter as an example of this class of methods. We investigate a variant of the filter that allows multiple detections per object from the same sensor, a critical capability when deploying tracking in the context of distributed networks of machine learning-based virtual sensors. We show that this breaks the inter-detection dependencies in the filter updates of the standard GLMB filter, allowing updates with significantly improved parallel scalability and enabling efficient deployment on GPU hardware. We report the results of a preliminary analysis of a GPU-accelerated implementation of our proposed GLMB tracker, with a focus on run time scalability with respect to the number of objects and the maximum number of retained hypotheses."

However, due to the intrinsic high computational workload of YOLO model, it is still challenging when implementing large models on the embedded device, especially the latest version YOLOv11. In this paper, we propose the hardware design based on time-division multiplexing of the key computational block C3k2 which is most used in YOLOv11 on FPGA. Firstly, we extend a fast convolution (Conv) algorithm to our Conv layer. Secondly, the batch normalization (BN) layer has been significantly optimized, especially in the stage of calculating the mean and variance. Finally, a Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) activation function in the form of a piecewise function will appear completely in the form of time-division multiplexing, which will greatly reduce the consumption of resources. Experimental results show that our design can achieve a 0.19 ms delay on an AMD artix-7 xc7a35tftg256 FPGA under the working frequency of 50 MHz, while the average relative error is 1.67%. Furthermore, we use the cw305 board, which can extract power information, to implement a simple power analysis (SPA) on C3k2 block and the SiLU. The information within the hardware design was successfully analyzed, such as the number of runs and input data information."

The performance of the proposed system was evaluated against three existing methods, including a simple Random Forest (RF) classifier, a mixed Gated Recurrent Unit-Convolutional Neural Network (GRU-CNN), and a VGG-16 model with transfer learning. The study utilized the public ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database. Once the audio signals were converted to Mel spectrogram images, the training and testing processes followed. The new CNN-ECA model outperformed all baseline models with an excellent performance rate for this multi-group classification, reaching 95.0% accuracy and 94.5% F1-score. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of a simple attention mechanism can substantially improve the ability of the CNN to identify and utilize critical information in the sounds. The CNN-ECA model thus stands to become an efficient system for automatic identification of respiratory diseases."

We evaluate both pipelines on the OLMo2-7B-SFT model for CommonsenseQA, suitable for intermittent or denied connectivity scenarios typical of edge networks. Under identical pruning schedules, L2PSD achieves comparable or superior test accuracy to L2PFT, indicating that the choice of loss function has a significant impact on compressed model recovery in resource-constrained environments."

Specifically, given a time-expanded graph constructed from an original network graph, we propose an optimization problem to find a subset of network services to maximize their total completion rewards such that the data of all services in this subset can be transmitted to their destination nodes by their deadlines. Unfortunately, solving this problem directly is challenging since it is a mixed-integer program. We propose a heuristic algorithm based on a sequential rounding approach where a linear programming (LP) feasibility problem is iteratively solved to update the network service subset, guided by a relaxed reward maximization problem that prioritizes high-reward requests. To further improve efficiency, we fine-tune the above LP feasibility problem from a static flow perspective, enabling fast feasibility checks on the original graph, and design the corresponding efficient heuristic algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the trade-off among different approaches and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

    "abstract": "Wireless communications and remote sensing require accurate knowledge of target location to perform directional beamforming. This is especially true for mobile applications, when platform dynamics, long range and evolving mission demands necessitate beam tracking to maintain system performance. In practice, these dynamics create target location ambiguity, stressing application performance when directional beams are not accurately steered. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel ambiguity beamforming optimization program to uniformly distribute energy across a two-dimensional uncertainty region. The methodology operates on array weights without signal pre-coding, a departure from alternative approaches, while maximizing physical-layer availability for user applications such as sensing and communications. The uncertainty region has been quantized via Fibonacci spherical sampling for uniform optimization solving, and the resulting density has been related to worst-case gain error to fine-tune performance. Our results show an approximately 25 dB improvement in worst-case beamforming gain across uncertainty regions with a maximized uniform gain, while simultaneously minimizing off-angle energy, and the practical design makes it viable for adoption into emerging systems."

The model captures local motifs and temporal dependencies, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 661.65 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 779.25, significantly outperforming classical models: ARIMA (MAE: 7603.09, RMSE: 9094.82), Holt-Winters (MAE: 1080.37, RMSE: 1217.77), and Linear Regression (MAE: 1446.69, RMSE: 1699.96). By leveraging symbolic patterns and statistical modeling, the model offers robust performance for real-time applications in resource-constrained settings. This work advances energy forecasting by addressing limitations in traditional and deep learning approaches, providing a scalable solution for modern energy systems."

    "abstract": "Augmented reality in e-commerce seeks to enhance customer experience in regard to return rates while bringing satisfaction. The basic application of e-commerce seems to be facing high returns as well as the impossibility to visualize products. Return rate levels due to dissatisfaction with traditional product representation stand at a very unacceptable high level. Methods involving a standard product image plus text description fail to yield immersive experiences. The proposed work is to incorporate AR into e-commerce portals so that customers can envision products in their real-world environment before buying them. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the influence of AR on customer conversion rates, return rates, and satisfaction. In this research, the novelty will be applied by using AR to fill the gap between online and in-store purchasing experiences to provide a more interactive and informed purchasing decision process. Findings have been generated indicating that features of AR bring about significant return rates decline and conversion rate enhancement with higher customer confidence levels towards purchase decisions. Results depict how AR can influence the potentiality of customer satisfaction, enabling them to experience a more immersive, transparent, and interactive shopping environment. This research contributes to the rapidly expanding knowledge base on AR in e-commerce, providing valuable information for businesses looking to leverage new technologies to increase customer engagement and retention."

The paper uses a clinical and demographic data to examine the applicability of the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) in classifying heart disease. The data set consists of 14 attributes such as age, sex, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise angina, old peak (ST depression), and ST slope, and the binary target attribute that indicates whether the individual has a heart disease or not. This dataset was used to train and test the SVC model on the existence of heart disease. Normalization and encoding of data preprocessing and stringent measures of preprocessing data were adopted to give optimal results in the model. The result indicates good classification figures: 88 accuracy, 0.88 precision of both classes, 0.85 recall of non-diseased patients and 0.89 recall of diseased patients, and F1 of 0.87. This is evidenced by the fact that the SVC model can categorize patients with and without heart disease. The findings demonstrate that clinical and demographic variables should be considered in machine learning algorithms to provide powerful predictive analytics. The precision, recall and F1-score of the SVC model are close to accuracy and thus balanced leading to its suitability in diagnosis of heart disease classification. The study contributes to the growing body of knowledge about the use of machine learning in healthcare, demonstrating how SVC can be used to enhance the early detection process and make informed clinical judgments."

Early diagnosis and classification of these diseases is fundamental for good therapy. An automated mango leaf disease detection convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system is presented in this paper. A publicly available dataset including images of both healthy and sick leaves was used encompassing several illness categories in order to imitate real-world circumstances. Excellent results in all disease areas came from CNN model training and evaluation. Precision, recall, and average accuracy measurements demonstrated how well different diseases could be distinguished with minimal mistakes. Analysis of Precision-Recall curves and confusion matrices validated consistent generalizing across training and validation datasets. Stable convergence free of overfitting assured reliable forecasts from the model. The results validate the CNN-based method as a practical tool for early disease identification, therefore reducing the demand for human inspection and enabling rapid response. This approach can help to support sustainable development by way of improved disease control. More study could expand the system to real-time applications and larger datasets therefore enhancing its scalability and usability."

The long-standing methods of IDS are usually centralized data gathering, vulnerating information and unable to address the changing cyber threats in heterogeneous IoT environments. In addressing these shortcomings, this study introduces FedAdaptShield, adaptive IDS based on federated intelligence which facilitates decentralized training of models on edge devices without exchange of raw data, hence, privacy protection. FedAdaptShield adds an adaptive learning dynamic, which uses models and adapts them according to new patterns of attacks that occur, making the system more accurate and robust in detecting attacks. Employed in federated learning architectures and deep neural networks models, FedAdaptShield proves to have an accuracy level greater than 98% on a variety of attacks and demonstrates better performance in comparison to baseline and centralized IDS implementations. FedAdaptShield eliminates network bandwidth and computational requirements in collaborative learning settings because learning is performed locally, yet using high security services. The scalable, efficient and privacy-aware solution can be effectively used to counter highly-efficient cyber threats in IoT applications across smart homes, healthcare, and industrial automation."

By embedding this mechanism within local computation units and peripheral input circuits, the architecture reduces stochastic number generation time by 16x. The system utilizes a 6T SRAM array with shared linear feedback shift registers (LFSR) to store 8-bit weights and generate uncorrelated bitstreams. These streams are processed through correlation-aware stochastic logic circuits, followed by binary restoration via counters and shift-accumulate units. The proposed macro is fabricated in TSMC 28nm CMOS process, supporting 8-bit input/weight multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations and delivers a 19-bit output with a clock frequency of $\\mathbf{4 1. 7 ~ M H z}$.

While the ECHO protocol enables control-free broadcasting, it lacks prioritization and directionality in its Pruned Flood (PF) phase. This paper presents Greedy-ECHO, a backward-compatible enhancement that introduces a lightweight, score-based suppression mechanism. Each forwarding node computes a Greedy Score using hop distance, RSSI, Spreading Factor (SF), and battery level, and transmits only if no better candidate is overheard. Greedy-ECHO preserves ECHO’s stateless design while reducing redundancy and latency. The protocol requires no control messaging or neighbor discovery, making it suitable for embedded and energy-constrained deployments. NS-3 simulations under realistic LoRaWAN conditions show that Greedy-ECHO improves delivery ratio by up to 11.4%, reduces total communication load by 21.7%, and produces a more compact connected dominating set compared to baseline ECHO."

    "abstract": "The pitch pointing error of the telescope is a key factor affecting high-precision observation, characterized by non-linearity and multi-source. Existing correction methods mainly rely on long-term observation data to analyze the influence of different error sources, which limits their application in the early stage of telescope installation and calibration. To solve this problem, in this paper, a pitch pointing error analysis and compensation method based on the inclination sensor and the Beidou differential positioning system is proposed. In the analysis, the pitch pointing error of the telescope at various azimuth and pitch angles is calculated according to the actual pitch angle measured by the inclination sensor and the theoretical pitch angle provided by the encoder firstly. Then, the primary error sources are systematically analyzed and corrected. For the azimuth axis tilt, the Beidou differential positioning system is used to collect the positioning data of the telescope, and the motion trajectory is fitted using the positioning data to determine the tilt attitude. Regarding azimuth bearing defects, the spatial-domain filtering algorithm combining standard deviation thresholding with weighted average correction is employed to detect and correct the abrupt errors in the inclination sensor measurement value. Aiming for the pitch encoder zero offset, the finite element model is used to analyze the mechanical stress on the inclination sensor at different pitch angles, and the difference between sensor and encoder readings at the angle of minimum stress is used to quantify the offset value. To solve the structural gravity deformation, the inclination sensor is used to measure the pointing deviations caused by gravity under different pitch angles, and the polynomial model is used to characterize the error trend. Finally, a sinusoidal error model is designed to correct the residual error that varies with pitch angle. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively analyze and correct the above error sources during the installation and calibration stage, which is of great significance for improving the pitch pointing accuracy of the telescope."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a multi-physics design methodology to enhance the performance of high-speed synchronous reluctance machines (SynRMs). The primary innovation is to optimize the design of the rotor flux guides (FGs), instead of the commonly optimized flux barriers. This may sound like a minor change and just a dual model, but the difference in results is significant and allows different mechanical solutions. In case of transversally laminated rotor targeting high speeds requires thick radial and tangential ribs to support the flux guides, but the ribs diminish torque and power factor and negatively impact efficiency. Reducing the rotor mass can decrease the thickness of these ribs, improving performance. This research combines the optimization of rotor FGs with effective mechanical support strategies based on the machine's maximum speed, comparing two constructional methods: conventional radial and tangential ribs, and non-magnetic backplates between flux guides. Optimizing the rotor geometry with FGs provides deeper insight into the design process and ensures the rotor is electromagnetically and mechanically optimized for maximum performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, a 6-pole-36-slot motor with 300 kW peak power featuring 2, 3, or 4 FGs, identical stator dimensions, and a maximum speed of 12,000 r/min is designed, optimized, and compared. A prototype of a 6-pole-36-slot motor with 3 FGs manufactured with backplates is presented, along with initial measurement results."

The paper proposes a fully coherent fusion method for moving target detection on BeiDou-based passive multistatic radar. It first implements a signal synchronization algorithm, followed by a joint signal parameter estimation method based on the sparse algorithm and the least squares method. Lastly, a coherent matching strategy is applied to align target positions and phases in all integrated maps. This enables the multi-source coherent fusion of echoes, maximizing the target energy in practice. Both simulated and real-measured data prove the remarkable performance in weak target detection compared to the existing methods."

    "abstract": "Cardiac disease remains a leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, necessitating continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of cardiac activities. Traditional contact-based ECG monitoring is limited by patient discomfort, skin irritation, and restricted long-term usability, driving the need for non-contact alternatives. This study introduces a system for reconstructing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from radar-based chest displacement data, treating the human body as a signal generator and radar as a state observer. Each heartbeat is modeled as an independent event, and system parameters are iteratively optimized using reinforcement learning to refine state-space matrices. This integration enables accurate reconstruction of stable physiological signals. Experimental results from an overnight sleep dataset demonstrate high fidelity in cardiac motion reconstruction, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient approximately 0.9 of the ECG waveform and a mean absolute error of 16.45 ms in heart rate variability (HRV) compared to polysomnography (PSG) reference, approaching clinical-grade accuracy. The proposed system effectively addresses common generalization challenges in data-driven methods, achieving high accuracy with minimal training data and maintaining consistent performance across subjects, ensuring robust and scalable non-contact cardiac monitoring."

    "abstract": "In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, the high-dimensionality and the complex coupling of spatial-spectral features present severe challenges to existing deep learning methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Researchers have recently explored CNN and Transformer-based methods to overcome these limitations, but CNN's limited receptive field prevents effective modeling of long-range dependencies, while Transformers suffer from high computational cost and inefficiency in high-dimensional data. Motivated by these limitations, the state-space model (SSM) Mamba shows great potential as an efficient alternative for sequence and dependency modeling. Building on this foundation, we propose HyPyraMamba, a novel architecture designed to effectively overcome the above challenges. It integrates the Pyramid Spectral Attention (PSA) module to capture multi-scale key spectral features, thereby reducing interference caused by spectral redundancy. We developed an Adaptive Expert Depthwise Convolution (AEDC) module that enhances the model's ability to express multi-scale spatial-spectral features, and a sequence modeling module, Mamba. In the Mamba module, we utilize the spatial Mamba and spectral Mamba branches to enhance spatial structure and spectral correlation modeling. Extensive experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that HyPyraMamba significantly outperforms several recent state-of-the-art methods and provides a favorable accuracy–efficiency trade-off. In particular, class-wise analyses on spectrally similar land-cover categories (e.g., different soybean and bareland types) show that HyPyraMamba markedly reduces mutual confusion compared with CNN-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based baselines. The code will be available at https://github.com/dekai-li/HyPyraMamba."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) and multispectral images (MSIs) fusion is a hot topic in the remote sensing society. A high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI) can be obtained by fusing a low-resolution HSI (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution MSI (HR-MSI) or RGB image. However, most deep learning-based methods require a large amount of HR-HSIs for supervised training, which is very rare in practice. In this paper, we propose a coupled diffusion posterior sampling (CDPS) method for HSI and MSI fusion in which the HR-HSIs are no longer required in the training process. Because the LR-HSI contains the spectral information and HR-MSI contains the spatial information of the captured scene, we design an unsupervised strategy that learns the required diffusion priors directly and solely from the input test image pair (the LR-HSI and HR-MSI themselves). Then, a coupled diffusion posterior sampling method is proposed to introduce the two priors in the diffusion posterior sampling which leverages the observed LR-HSI and HR-MSI as fidelity terms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised HSI and MSI fusion methods. Additionally, this method utilizes smaller networks that are simpler and easier to train without other data."

In this work, we present two new QKD methods called \"BB84 with Quantum Error Mitigation\" and \"FAST QKD\", each leveraging fast quantum state tomography (FQST) over quantum reference states - preamble qubits - to compute a channel model at a much faster rate than conventional tomography methods. Fast QKD further expands by leveraging fast tomography itself, permitting lower fidelity thresholds in noisy conditions while maintaining secure key generation. An evaluation of new potential attacks for both processes is also presented."

Unlike legacy systems such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and terrestrial networks (TNs), LEO-based systems experience large Doppler shifts and delay spreads, where traditional orthogonalization methods become ineffective. Compared to widely used sequences like Gold and Zadoff-Chu (ZC), Björck sequences offer improved ambiguity function behavior, nearly ideal autocorrelation, greater resilience to interference, and accurate delay estimation in high Doppler environments. To broaden their applicability, we also introduce a novel construction method that extends Björck sequences to non-prime lengths while minimizing cyclic autocorrelation. Focusing on LEO-based non-terrestrial network (NTN) localization, we compare the positioning performance of Björck and Gold sequences under diverse interference scenarios. The results demonstrate Björck sequences as a viable alternative for PRS design in Doppler-challenged NTN positioning systems."

Moreover, the flat structure of the architecture is compatible than the existing chip manufacturing which sidesteps the major fabrication and integration problems that hinder CNTFETs.

    "abstract": "Hardware Trojans (HTs) pose significant threats to Integrated Circuits (ICs), particularly when test procedures are outsourced to potentially malicious third parties. Traditional detection approaches often fail under stealthy, dynamic adversaries, such as malicious testers who behave honestly during most sessions and deviate intermittently, executing so-called On-Off attacks. This paper proposes a trust evaluation framework that moves beyond individual test outcomes and instead assesses the trustworthiness of aggregate test data over time. Our model uses Bayesian inference with ternary anomaly feedback (detected, not detected, and uncertain) to estimate belief states. A prospect-theoretic utility function captures varying system risk tolerances, enabling application-aware trust assessment. To counter on-off attacks, we introduce an asymmetric weighted moving average (AWMA) scheme that penalizes abrupt deviations more than rewards cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework reliably detects transient threats, adapts to imperfect anomaly detection, and reflects critical system-level trust requirements."

    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) has become a highly promising architecture for the future of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, congestion remains a significant challenge in NDN, as it hinders real-time communication between network devices and lowers the Quality of Service (QoS). Developing effective congestion control mechanisms for NDN remains a persistent challenge, particularly in fully utilizing its multipath routing and router capabilities. Previous work has overlooked the essential role of NDN routers in congestion control. To address this gap, we propose an efficient Probability-based Forwarding Mechanism considering Load Factor for Congestion Control (ProLoC) in NDN. Our innovative approach incorporates the load factor into the probability-based forwarding decision process and dynamically updates congestion information. The mechanism actively manages traffic, distributes load across multiple paths to prevent congestion, and optimizes resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that ProLoC outperforms three state-of-the-art congestion control protocols for NDN (PCON, QSCCP, and AQM). Specifically, ProLoC demonstrates zero packet loss over 10,000 time steps, in contrast to AQM's 14,080 lost packets and PCON's 24. Throughput comparisons show that ProLoC achieves 53.8 % higher throughput than QSCCP and a 156.2 % improvement over PCON, while consistently maintaining a stable round-trip time (RTT) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$11 \\pm 1 ~\\text{ms}$</tex> and a near perfect fairness index of 0.9995. This highlights ProLoC's ability to prevent and respond to sudden network congestion while maintaining high performance across key metrics."

Specifically, attackers may place a rogue device, which is under their control, into a CPS to be used at a time and place (consider mobile systems) of their choosing. To sufficiently defend a system, one may need to detect such a device before operating a system, such as driving an automobile. We propose and present results from a novel approach that couples time-domain reflectometry (TDR) with physics-informed machine learning to detect and localize rogue devices.

    "abstract": "Brain stroke is a serious and life-threatening medical emergency caused by interrupted blood flow to the brain, leading to permanent neurological damage or death if not diagnosed early. Predicting stroke risk from patient health data remains challenging due to complex feature interactions, data imbalance, and heterogeneous clinical attributes. This work proposes a Hybrid Autoencoder and Ensemble Deep Learning Model for reliable stroke prediction using the publicly available Kaggle dataset. The proposed system integrates a denoising autoencoder to extract compact latent features from demographic, lifestyle, and medical variables, effectively reducing noise and redundancy in the input space. These latent representations are concatenated with key original attributes and used to train multiple advanced models, including TabNet, FT-Transformer, Deep Neural Networks, XGBoost, and CatBoost. Class imbalance is addressed through the Borderline-SMOTE technique and class-balanced focal loss during model optimization. A stacking ensemble with logistic regression as a meta-learner combines the outputs of the top-performing base models to generate the final prediction. Experimental evaluation demonstrates improved accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC compared to traditional machine learning and standalone neural network approaches, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid deep ensemble for early stroke risk assessment."

To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-enhanced deep learning framework for real-time driver drowsiness detection within intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The system integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for modeling temporal behavior, and an attention mechanism to prioritize fatigue-related cues such as eyelid closure, yawning, and gaze deviation. Attention maps highlight critical regions, improving interpretability and reducing false detections. The framework is optimized for low latency and can operate on embedded platforms for in-vehicle deployment. Experimental evaluations on benchmark and custom-acquired datasets demonstrate an accuracy exceeding 95%, with superior robustness under varying illumination and head pose conditions. The proposed approach provides a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution for enhancing road safety and advancing real-time driver monitoring in modern ITS environments."

Although most of them currently rely on a single, proprietary, embedded system, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) are poised to accommodate multiple such systems, each best suited for different operating environments. Detecting which system is currently active is important for identifying system malfunction or compromise.We developed a machine learning-based classifier to distinguish between various automated systems, as well as when a human is driving, using only telematics data. We employed a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based classification model trained on time-series telematics datasets from three automated driving systems: Comma’s Openpilot, Tesla’s Autopilot, and Cadillac’s Super-Cruise, to analyze key driving behavior indicators such as acceleration profiles, braking, and steering patterns. Our experiments show that we can differentiate between the three automated systems or when a human is driving (F1-score of 90+%). Our tests are on passenger cars, but we expect our system to be applicable to any automated vehicle type (land, air, or marine) with telematics."

    "abstract": "As the 5G New Radio (NR) standard is primarily designed to meet the needs of commercial cellular communications, it is not inherently robust against malicious interference sources such as jammers. To support military-grade deployments in diverse tactical environments, there is a need for a jamming-resilient physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) receiver. PUCCH plays a vital role in transmitting various control messages, collectively referred to as uplink control information (UCI), from user equipment (UE) to the base station (BS). For UCI payloads between 3 and 11 bits, small block coding (SBC) is employed. Due to their short lengths, these codes do not include a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), complicating error detection and the assurance of message reliability, especially in the presence of interference. To address this challenge, we propose a jamming-resilient PUCCH receiver that leverages a robust reliability assessment mechanism based on a threshold criterion, which bounds the probability of decoding errors. Additionally, we introduce a channel estimation error-aware equalizer tailored for DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, enabling more accurate computation of log-likelihood ratios (LLRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed receiver can effectively evaluate decoding reliability without relying on CRC, even under jamming conditions, thereby enhancing the robustness of 5G control signaling in contested environments."

    "abstract": "In intelligent pressure sensor System-on-Chip (SoC) applications, the micro-controller unit (MCU) serves as a critical control and computational core, with its power consumption directly impacting system energy efficiency and battery life. These MCUs typically operate in a periodic wake-up and short-term operation mode within such systems. Reducing MCU active time by maximizing operating frequency is essential for power savings. This study proposes a dynamic adaptive calibration technique for maximum frequency, which adjusts system frequency in real time by monitoring MCU instruction fetch correctness. Unlike conventional voltage-tracking-based maximum frequency calibration, this approach eliminates voltage detection circuits and voltage-frequency mapping tables while mitigating aging effects. In low-power designs, clock control strategy plays an important role in optimizing power consumption. This paper proposes an instruction-decoding-driven fine-grained dynamic clock control technique. Compared to conventional approaches, this method enables instruction-level clock gating to achieve micro-operation-level power optimization. Experimental validation in intelligent sensor systems demonstrates that the proposed low-power technique enhances system energy efficiency by 16% under typical operating conditions."

    "abstract": "Precise nucleus segmentation is a very important condition of computational pathology and analysis of whole-slide images, which allows the accurate quantification of cellular morphology and spatial arrangement. Nevertheless, conventional deep learning systems tend to lose fine nuclear borders and feature variety in the decoding process. This research proposed a Boundary Aware EfficientNet-UNet and Channel Shuffle Decoder to overcome these constraints to segment nuclei in H&E-stained histopathological images automatically. To extract the multi-scale contextual features, the proposed framework uses an EfficientNet-B0 encoder which is computationally efficient. There is the introduction of a channel shuffle-based decoder to increase the inter channel feature interaction and decrease redundancy to be able to get better feature fusion during upsampling. Also, the skip connections provide structural consistency of the encoder and decoder paths. The model is trained and tested on NuInsSeg dataset. The experimental findings reveal that the given approach performs better in terms of Dice coefficient of 0.82 and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 0.71 and accuracy of 95 percent especially at the boundaries of nuclei, and the computational overhead is low."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the frequency assignment problem in high-throughput geostationary satellite communication (SATCOM) systems, where co-channel interference imposes serious constraints on spectrum efficiency. We propose two computational frameworks, ALG-MUSIC and ALG-BEAT, developed within our SatDreamOpt system to optimize frequency allocation under interference limitations. ALG-MUSIC seeks to maximize the number of users assigned their full bandwidth, while ALG-BEAT prioritizes activating a larger total of weighted user sub-channels by allowing partial allocations. Both approaches employ a Two-Pass hybrid strategy. The first pass applies a greedy heuristic to assign sub-channels while strictly enforcing interference thresholds. The second pass expands the candidate set by temporarily relaxing these constraints, followed by an integer programming model that selects a final set of active users satisfying the interference limits. Experiments on both synthetic and SatDreamOpt data show that ALG-MUSIC achieves solution quality comparable to commercial solvers such as Gurobi, but with significantly reduced computation time. ALG-BEAT achieves higher spectrum utilization, especially in bandwidth-constrained settings. Both algorithms scale effectively to problem sizes beyond the reach of exact methods. The results demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of hybrid optimization for interference-aware frequency planning in satellite networks."

These technologies enable efficient implementations of XOR and majority logic, which offer superior expressiveness compared to traditional AND/OR logic. As a result, researchers have introduced new logical structures MIGs and XMGs, which pose more demands for digital logic synthesis. In this paper, we propose a node merging algorithm using fault detect model for XMGs logic synthesis, including building an optimal majority node and XOR node model using the path sensitivity method from single stuck-at fault model testing, activating and propagating faults among majority node and XOR nodes in the XMGs, and using ROBDD tree to compute and store the mandatory assignment sets for efficient storage. The algorithm is implemented in the C++ language under the framework of the EPFL logic synthesis tool. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the depth and number of nodes of XMGs circuits when applied to the standard test circuit in EPFL, with an average optimization depth of 2.07% and an average optimization number of 0.91% in the 2-level verification, and can gain better optimization effect when the window sizes increase."

Since the on-board sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such ‘newly’ sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and non-quantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts."

Nonvolatility is provided by spintronics, while ultrafast switching can be performed with minimal energy use utilizing memristors. However, despite that potential for exponential speedups, quantum computing is an extremely challenging thing to implement. In both case of memristors and spintronic devices, the power efficiency is much higher than conventional CMOS technologies. The comparison shows that they are capable of achieving 50–100 TOPS/W, which is beyond CMOS.

    "abstract": "The future 6G communication systems are expected to enable and support new robotic applications that rely on a higher density of communication links. At the same time the adoption of robotics is becoming more and more widely. One of the new emerging research areas is the integration of robotics into delivery processes to alleviate human labor. In this work we examine a scenario in bike delivery which combines Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and robots with Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). We present a demonstration that showcases preliminary steps toward realizing the full scenario. The demonstration features a robot that autonomously loads cargo into a delivery bag. In the envisioned system, a UAV delivers packages near the bicycle, and a robot loads the items into a bag mounted on the rear of the bike. With the application of V2X technology in this scenario, these components could form a network and communicate with each other. This approach aims to enhance the efficiency and regularity of deliveries, thereby ease the burden of the human in delivery. This preliminary work presents a demonstration in which a robot autonomously picks up a small cargo item from the ground and loads it into a bag, simulating the envisioned loading procedure."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an isoflux beamforming method for phased array antennas in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, incorporating two key enhancements to the classical method of maximum power transmission efficiency (MMPTE). A constraint-based optimization strategy is introduced to enable wide-angle isoflux coverage, while a precision weighting mechanism is developed to support consistent power distribution and directional flexibility in multi-beam scenarios. These techniques respectively address the challenges of significant link loss variation across wide angular spans and gain degradation at large off-axis angles. By embedding constraints into the optimization process and dynamically adjusting the weight matrix, the proposed method achieves consistent isoflux radiation under varying orbital altitudes. Simulation results based on a 6×6 uniform rectangular array (URA) show that the proposed method effectively forms wide-angle beams covering up to ±40° with deviations of less than 1dB from the theoretical profile. In addition, flexible direction and gain control in dual- and triple-beam scenarios is demonstrated. The results further confirm the broad applicability of the proposed method to isoflux beam shaping across varying orbital altitudes, validating its effectiveness in enabling wide-angle and multi-beam isoflux communication with consistent signal quality in LEO environments."

Thus, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging are vital for diagnosing COVID-19. Particularly, chest CT is more advantageous because it provides rapid results, cost-effective, and offers high sensitivity for detecting lung infections. Recently, Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques have shown significant potential for clinical imaging. However, training traditional DL models requires large datasets, and medical professionals face increased risks when gathering CT images from COVID-19 individuals due to the complicated growth of the virus. Thus, this work presents an effective Mutated leader Algorithm_DenseNet (MLA_DenseNet) for classifying various levels of COVID-19. At first, the input CT image is pre-processed by an adaptive bilateral filter. Thereafter, lung lobe segmentation was conducted through U-Net ++. After that, segmentation of lung lesions is conducted based on U-Net ++. In addition, significant features are extracted from the lung lesion segmentation results. Lastly, COVID-19 classification is carried out using a Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and the Mutated Leader Algorithm (MLA) is utilized to train the hyperparameters of DenseNet. Furthermore, the developed module achieved precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 90.00%, 90.288%, and 90.858%."

In this work, we demonstrate spectral channelization in the D-band across a 32 GHz bandwidth at a spectral resolution of 1 GHz with a sample rate 64 GS/s. A low-complexity polyphase filterbank that replaces fast Fourier transform (FFT) blocks that require ${\\mathcal{O}}$(N logN) multiplications with an approximate discrete Fourier transform (DFT) requiring zero multiplication operations is used for channelization. An analysis filterbank of order 32 is used for box-car responses across each subband, with a total interference suppression better than 44 dB. Spectrum occupancy is sensed using a multiplierless energy detection algorithm; an error correction technique is proposed and demonstrated experimentally to show how the approximate discrete Fourier transform (ADFT) errors can be largely removed for sensing applications. A testbed consisting of a D-band receiver from Virginia Diodes and a digital mixed-signal field programmable gate array (FPGA) platform from Altera with integrated analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) operating at 64 GS/s over 128 parallel digital phases are used for verification of the algorithms."

    "abstract": "In 6G mobile communication systems, it is anticipated that joint channel estimation and data decoding (JCED) will play a key role in resource sharing, spectrum utilization and reducing the hardware costs. The shortcomings of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as a JCED waveform have led to interest in new waveforms, among them Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS), which has good spectral efficiency and error rate performance even in doubly spread channels. In theory, it has all the features required for a next-generation waveform, but over-the-air (OTA) experiments are lacking. In this paper, we describe the first OTA implementation of Zak-OTFS with a spread pilot for JCED at sub-6GHz frequencies. We perform turbo iteration to improve channel predictability. Our bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) results against pilot to data power ratio (PDR) show that the selection of PDR plays an important role in improving the performance of JCED using Zak-OTFS with spread pilot."

    "abstract": "Accurate wireless channel modeling is essential for the development and testing of modern communication systems, but traditional channel emulators often struggle to adapt to dynamic environments that vary in time. In order to address substantial demand for bandwidth in contemporary communication systems, the Terahertz spectrum (THz) could be utilized to build \"beyond 5G and 6G\" communication systems, particularly those with Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). To address the challenges of channel emulation in dynamic high bandwidth environments like the THz band, we propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)-based wireless channel emulator capable of learning statistical channel characteristics directly from raw signal data. Unlike conventional approaches, the proposed framework is designed to generalize across diverse channel conditions, including additive noise and both large- and small-scale fading effects, while also adapting to potential temporal variations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our CGAN-based generator effectively replicates real-world wireless channels, including Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and various fading distributions such as Rayleigh, and Nakagami. We further validate our model on different modulation schemes that were previously unseen by the model during training, showcasing its versatility in practical communication scenarios. The performance of the proposed emulator is evaluated by comparing the statistical similarity between the true and emulated channel distributions using multiple distance metrics and analyzing first-, second- and higher-order moments. The results confirm that the proposed architecture provides an accurate and adaptive channel emulation framework, offering a robust tool for the design and evaluation of wireless communication systems."

Existing anomaly detection algorithms cannot effectively solve the anomaly detection problem of multi-dimensional time series operation status data. Because the statistical characterization of data is dynamically changing caused by frequent server increase or decrease and/or application online or offline. Inspired by pre-trained models, we study the problem of anomaly detection for multi-dimensional time series data from the aspect of pre-trained model. To address this problem, we propose a pretrained model called TS-iCutpaste. Specifically, first, we propose a Shift-Image-Transform approach to transforming time series data to a series of images. Then, we propose an improved Cutpaste approach to perform anomaly detection on images based on multi-dimensional time series data. Finally, we conduct experiments on the dataset and compare TS-iCutpaste with Cutpaste and TS-Bert. The results show that TS-iCutpaste can improve the accuracy by an average of 10 % compared with these methods."

Unlike single RIS solutions, distributed RISs cover a broader area and field of view, improving interference management and signal reception at the RTA. RTAs receive interference directly from satellites and indirectly, in opposite phase, via the RISs. Our approach optimizes the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio by jointly optimizing RISs’ reflecting coefficients for interference self-mitigation and receive beamforming weights at RTA. This alignment reduces the interference. Our method employs active RISs capable of amplification to ensure sufficient reflected signal strength and effective cancellation of direct interference at the RTA. Simulations confirm the method’s effectiveness in reducing interference at RTA, improving the detection of astronomical signals, and validating this approach as a practical solution for protecting astronomical observations from growing SATCOM interference."

The proposed magnetic coupler uses a three-layer DD coil structure, with mutually orthogonal magnetic fields, which was utilized to generate mutual inductance to remain stable during rotation, with minimal variations under axial, radial, and polar angle misalignments. A design optimization method integrating Finite element analysis (FEA) and sequential mixed-integer nonlinear programming (SMINLP) is proposed, determining optimal mutual inductance and finding matching structural parameters, which save time of simulation and experiment. Compared to existing magnetic couplers, the proposed magnetic coupler exhibits tolerance against 360° full-space misalignment. At last, the prototype validates the multi-directional anti-misalignment capability of the proposed magnetic coupler."

    "abstract": "We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network—conceptually they are <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">active channel scatterers</i> with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (i) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station."

To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach to collect per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the need for an expensive robotic mannequin and reducing data collection time from 2 hours to 2 minutes. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid person representation that ensures precise human-garment alignment.

Based on the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, it was found that there are two peaks at 4.984 THz and 6.629 THz, with peak values of 86.18% and 94.43% under direct incidence conditions. The experimentally prepared samples exhibited peak frequencies of 4.977 THz and 6.648 THz, with peak values of 86.62% and 94.33% under direct incidence conditions, respectively. The paper analyzes the reasons for the absorption resonance at these two absorption peak frequencies from the perspectives of excitation electric field distribution and impedance. This metamaterial also demonstrates two remarkable characteristics: a large absorption half-value angle and a significant sensitivity to temperature regulation. Owing to its absorption peak, peak frequency, absorption angle, and other attributes, this metamaterial promises to be a highly promising receiver for 6G communication."

We developed an automatic irrigation system incorporating an ultraminiature fiber-optic pressure sensor for real-time IPP monitoring and control. The sensor, with an outer diameter of 0.125 mm, positioned 2 mm inside the ureteroscope tip, provides high-resolution pressure measurements (±~0.75 mmHg) with temperature compensation. A proportional-integral-derivative controller automatically adjusts the speed of a roller pump to maintain target IPP levels based on real-time sensor feedback. The system was evaluated using a porcine kidney model during insertion/removal of surgical instruments (272-μm laser fiber and 1.3-Fr basket forceps) and Ho:YAG laser lithotripsy procedures. Manual control showed delayed responses to pressure changes during both insertion and removal, whereas the automated control demonstrated a rapid return to a stable pressure. During 10-W Ho:YAG laser irradiation, constant pump speed operation led to progressive IPP baseline elevation with repeated firing, while the automated control prevented cumulative pressure buildup and maintained a stable baseline pressure. The fiber-optic sensor demonstrated superior spatial and temporal resolution compared to sheath-based pressure monitoring systems. The automated irrigation system effectively reduced IPP fluctuations during critical surgical operations. This approach represents a significant advancement in endourological safety and precision, and offers the potential for widespread clinical implementation in flexible ureteroscopy procedures."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) are well-suited for the nondestructive inspection (NDT) of adhesive joints as they can enable the transmission and reception of signals across the joint without requiring direct access to the damaged area. Conventional damage indices (DIs), such as the peak of the signal envelope, are limited for Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) adhesive joints due to the material's anisotropy and the complexity of UGW propagation. This is especially challenging for disbond detection and sizing. This study proposes an unsupervised approach using autoencoders for automatic disbond characterization in CFRP joints. Angle beam transducers (ABTs) were used in a pitch-catch setup to collect UGW signals under pristine conditions at two excitation frequencies (320 kHz and 650 kHz). The proposed DI is based on the reconstruction error between the original and autoencoder-reconstructed signals. Three architectures, including fully connected, Transformer-based, and CNN-LSTM autoencoders, were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and tested on independent scans. Performance was assessed using different metrics. Results show that the CNN-LSTM model consistently achieved the highest detection accuracy, while the Transformer model exhibited the most stable performance across folds. In a controlled temperature and humidity environment, the proposed DI provides superior localization and sizing of disbonds compared to conventional manually extracted signal features."

    "abstract": "While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved impressive results in natural image synthesis, their core strengths – creativity and realism – can be detrimental in medical applications, where accuracy and fidelity are paramount. These models instead risk introducing hallucinations and replication of unwanted acquisition noise. Here, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">YODA</i> (You Only Denoise once – or Average), a 2.5D diffusion-based framework for medical image translation (MIT). Consistent with DM theory, we find that conventional <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">diffusion</i> sampling stochastically replicates noise. To mitigate this, we draw and average multiple samples, akin to physical signal averaging. As this effectively approximates the DM’s expected value, we term this Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) sampling. We additionally propose regression sampling <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">YODA</i>, which retains the initial DM prediction and omits iterative refinement to produce noise-free images in a single step. Across five diverse multi-modal datasets – including multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT – we demonstrate that regression sampling is not only substantially more efficient but also matches or exceeds image quality of full <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">diffusion</i> sampling even with ExpA.

Furthermore, we show that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">YODA</i>-translated images are interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several medical applications."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound is widely applied in the dairy industry for milk decontamination, homogenization, and sterilization. This study presents an ultrasonic method for rapid, non-destructive characterization of fat content in bovine milk. It can provide information about fat content, droplet size, and the temporal evolution of milk product characteristics. This paper examines conventional linear ultrasonic techniques, such as speed of sound and attenuation, alongside nonlinear acoustical methods for precise bovine milk characterization. This study assesses the reliability of ultrasound-based fat quantification and compares the effectiveness of linear and nonlinear acoustic measurements. By analyzing the intrinsic nonlinearity of milk samples, this study advances milk characterization with a highly sensitive technique capable of detecting fat variations as low as 1 g/100ml—unachievable by conventional methods. Detailed analysis of the relative nonlinearity parameter sets a new standard for precision in nonlinear acoustic characterization of complex liquids. This research enables a rapid, non-destructive, and scalable ultrasonic method for milk fat characterization, with implications for quality control and dairy processing optimization. Unlike prior ultrasound studies that require controlled laboratory conditions, chemical reagents, or specialized sample preparation, our approach combines linear (speed/attenuation) and nonlinear (harmonic content) acoustic features at sub-cavitation drive levels to separate composition from temperature effects. The protocol is simple to execute, non-destructive, and suitable for in-line or atline monitoring, offering a practical path to rapid quality control in dairy processing."

However, widely used unimodal or limited-modal approaches, such as vibrotactile, electrotactile, force-feedback, thermal, and emerging mid-air ultrasound/magnetorheological systems, are merely capable of simulating few virtual materials, exhibit a deficiency in fidelity, and necessitate substantial training expenditures. To address these limitations, we propose a multivirtual object recognition system based on multimodal haptic feedback and develop an evaluation and training scheme. The system is based on electrohaptic, vibrohaptic, and thermohaptic, acquires four haptic perception modalities, roughness, sharpness, hardness, and temperature, and simulates the haptic sensation of eight different materials. In experiments, the fidelity alignment of haptic feelings of real and virtual objects is 85.8%, and after averaged 2.8 trainings, the recognition accuracy reaches 100%. Our research not only improves the realism of haptic feedback but also significantly reduces the training cost, providing a more cost-effective and practical solution for user experience enhancement in virtual reality (VR) and meta-universe applications."

    "abstract": "We propose a diversified prompting strategy to address the challenges of slot filling with Large Language Models (LLMs), where recall often suffers from prediction omissions and precision declines due to duplicate or excessive slot assignments. Our strategy combines sub-prompt, which partitions candidate slots into smaller groups to improve recall, and multi-view prompt, which applies diverse structural prompt variations to the same utterance. Final slot predictions are selected through threshold-based majority voting, effectively balancing recall and precision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (SNIPS, MASSIVE, and MultiWoz) with six LLMs (bloomz, falcon, llama2, llama3, qwen2, and gemma) show consistent improvements when compared with the baseline and all single-prompt methods. For example, on SNIPS, llama3-8B improves recall from 78.4 to 90.5 and F1 from 72.6 to 82.0. Additionally, we conducted experiments across various model sizes to confirm the general applicability of our methodology. These results demonstrate that the proposed diversified prompting strategy effectively restores balance among recall, precision, and F1, offering a scalable methodology for enhancing LLM-based slot filling."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) cloud platform enables multi-dimensional sharing of vehicle data, enhancing both its value and the quality of vehicle services. To ensure dynamic authorized access control and safeguard user privacy in the IoV cloud platform, an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is employed. However, existing state-of-the-art schemes still struggle to simultaneously address the following challenges: 1) the limitation of single-application scenarios due to the difficulty of achieving cross-primitive ciphertext transformation; 2) the risk of user privacy leakage caused by the inability to fully hide access policies; 3) the potential for malicious accusations against the delegator due to a lack of verifiability. To tackle these issues, we propose PPVTAC, a Privacy-Preserving, Verifiable, and Transformable Access Control scheme for cloud-assisted IoV. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid proxy re-encryption technique to transform ABE ciphertext into identity-based encryption (IBE) ciphertext, making it more suitable for collaborative scenarios. A cuckoo filter is introduced to achieve fully hidden policies, thereby protecting user privacy. Additionally, we incorporate non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKPs) to ensure verifiability, guaranteeing the correctness of transformed ciphertexts while preventing malicious accusations against the delegator. A further advantage of our scheme is its support for unbounded attribute spaces, eliminating the need for system reboot when adding new attributes. In addition, our scheme requires only a constant number of pairing operations during the decryption and re-encryption phases, regardless of the number of attributes. We formalize a security model and rigorously prove that our scheme achieves adaptive security. Our scheme achieves simultaneously for the first time cross-primitive ciphertext transformation, fully hidden policy, and verifiability while ensuring adaptive security. We implement our scheme in real-world environments and compare it with existing state-of-the-art schemes. Our approach offers a more comprehensive feature set without significant performance trade-offs, making it highly suitable for cloud-assisted IoV scenarios."

    "abstract": "The fast growth of Internet of Things (IoT)-based Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) has brought severe security issues such as unauthorized access, identity theft, and data tampering. MANETs' dynamic environment makes it more susceptible to attacks, hence the necessity for secure communication and anomaly detection. Enhancing Secure IoT Architecture in MANET Using Addax Optimizer and Discrete Hopfield Neural Network with Blockchain-Based BATMAN (DHNN-AOA) is presented in this research to enhance network security and routing effectiveness. First, behavioral and network traffic characteristics are gathered from IoT nodes and then feature selection through Quokka Swarm Optimization (QSO) to remove redundant information. Discrete Hopfield Neural Network (DHNN) is utilized for anomaly detection and node classification into normal or malicious, while Addax Optimization Algorithm (AOA) optimizes the hyperparameters of DHNN for learning rates, activation functions, and regularization weights to enhance the detection rate and minimize false alarms. Secure routing and authentication are ensured through integration of the Better Approach to Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (BATMAN) protocol with blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof authentication and trust-based communication. Fair Consensus in Blockchain with Heterogeneous Miners Technology proposed allows high-reputation nodes to authenticate transactions and ensure efficient and reliable security protocol for MANET-based communication. Experimental comparison confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model in comparison to other approaches, with a 14.82% improvement in detection accuracy and 16.91% in precision with a decrease in computational overhead. The model provides a scalable, adaptive, and privacy-preserving solution for MANET security in IoT-based systems, providing robust intrusion detection, secure routing, and efficient validation of consensus in decentralized networks."

The proposed technique leverages the mandatory SINR reports in 5G New Radio (NR) standards to intelligently allocate a subset of RBs with higher channel quality to higher priority source and vice versa for lower priority source. Using a simulation framework built on the finite blocklength channel coding model, we evaluate block error rate (BLER) and throughput under log-normal and Rayleigh fading channel models. Experiments were also done for 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). Our results prove that intelligently hopping provides a substantial performance advantage over a static, non-hopping baseline, maintaining low BLER even under low SINR conditions. These findings validate SINR-aware RB hopping as a powerful, low-complexity, and practical method for enhancing the resilience and reliability of NextG networks, specially, NextG smart factory/manufacturing."

These networks offer broadband Internet access to previously un-serviceable regions that lack sufficient terrestrial infrastructure. However, these LSNs are not without idiosyncrasies; relatively high latency and jitter accompany throughput variations. Most notably, though, are frequent packet losses that hinder link usage and consistent traffic flows. While consumer-focused LSNs such as Starlink have been extensively studied, other LSNs with distinct properties remain underexplored. In this work, a measurement study of the OneWeb LSN is presented, documenting and detailing an under-studied network which focuses on reliability and enterprise use-cases. Furthermore, we examine the potential benefits of liquid data transport, which allows TCP flows to maintain a large congestion window size and reduce retransmissions, thereby minimizing the impact of packet loss over LSNs. We find that OneWeb generally fulfills its service-level agreements, and liquid data transport may be used to further increase the reliability of TCP flows over LSNs."

The increasing deployment of 5G base stations (BSs) in neighboring frequency bands creates a risk of out-of-band (OOB) interference, threatening to disrupt RA. To address this risk, one would have to impose a limit on 5G deployment, which could in turn adversely affect its area coverage. In this paper, we present Varuna—an algorithm designed to maximize 5G network coverage while ensuring the OOB interference threshold at passive RA site is satisfied. Varuna operates by selectively adjusting the transmit power of 5G BSs based on a penalty-driven metric that balances coverage loss against interference reduction. Through simulation experiments on a real-world Very Large Baseline Antenna (VLBA) site and using the Irregular Terrain Model (ITM) propagation model, we demonstrate that Varuna achieves nearly maximum spatial coverage while offering OOB interference protection for RA."

    "abstract": "Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are among the most energy-intensive systems in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. With increased energy efficiency, economic benefits, and ecological consciousness, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based optimization methods for HVAC system control has become a groundbreaking trend. This paper discusses the design and implementation of AI-based optimization technologies for innovative, adaptive, and energy-efficient control of HVAC systems. Conventional HVAC systems typically operate on preprogrammed schedules or rule-based control, which are not responsive to fluctuating environmental conditions, usage patterns, and heat loads. In contrast, AI optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer real-time, dynamic control. The algorithms utilize past data, sensor data, and predictive models to adjust system parameters, thereby improving energy efficiency without compromising indoor thermal comfort. This research presents a detailed review and comparative assessment of various AI optimization techniques implemented in HVAC systems. The article highlights model predictive control (MPC) integrated with AI to forecast future environmental variations and optimize the actuator response accordingly. Machine learning algorithms are also investigated to learn and predict usage patterns, weather fluctuations, and thermal performance of buildings. Case studies of intelligent buildings demonstrate that this methodology is effective in reducing energy consumption by up to 30% while ensuring compliance with indoor air quality and comfort standards. Additionally, the paper addresses implementation issues, including computational complexity, data requirements, real-time processing capabilities, and integration with existing Building Management Systems (BMS). A hybrid approach that integrates data-driven models and physics-based simulations is proposed to achieve optimal performance and robust control. Overall, AI-activated optimization schemes offer a viable path to sustainable and intelligent management of HVAC systems. Their management of nonlinearities, adaptation to uncertainties, and learning capabilities make next-generation energy-efficient control strategies possible. Some of the future research frontiers include lightweight AI model design for edge deployment, integrating renewable energy sources, and privacy-preserving data analysis for occupant-centric optimization. This research advances the emerging field of innovative building technology, enabling global urban transitions to low-carbon and energy-resilient infrastructures."

Over the years, endoscopic imaging in diagnostic processes has played a significant role. Nevertheless, the conventional ways to identify these diseases do not usually work well in terms of high accuracy and consistency when identifying various classes of GI disorders. This work introduces a new ensemble method that can assist in classifying multiple gastrointestinal diseases using endoscopic images. The suggested approach is a hybrid of various deep learning models, namely, EfficientNetV2L, InceptionResNet, MobileNetV3Large, Vit-L16, and DenseNet-121, to improve diagnostic results. Through this ensemble method, a decent test accuracy of 92.37% is obtained, which is better than individual models and the current solutions. The idea behind this work is to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional diagnostic methods and offer a more credible, accurate, and reliable solution to the diagnostic challenges of GI diseases."

While reliability imposes timely-throughput (on-time delivery rate) requirements under strict latency constraints, resilience relates to the network’s ability to swiftly recover timely-throughput performance following an outage event caused by non-stationary conditions, such as node failures or shifting network topologies. While recent studies have increasingly focused on designing reliable network control policies, a comprehensive solution that combines reliable and resilient network control has yet to be fully explored. This paper formulates the least-cost resilient and reliable network control problem as a stochastic control problem with long and short-term timely throughput constraints. We then present a solution through the Resilient and Reliable Cloud Network Control (ResRCNC) algorithm and show through numerical experiments that it jointly ensures reliability under normal conditions and resilience upon complete network node failures."

In particular, the proposed model can capture how actions influence the manifestation of external threats. This leads to a radio power control optimization problem of maximizing network throughput while minimizing probability of detection, which we solve using a model predictive control heuristic.

    "abstract": "Low latency communication is critical for supporting latency-sensitive applications in beyond 5G and 6G networks. While there have been various advancements in optimizing the latency, current network architectures still route data traffic between User Equipments (UEs) connected to the same gNodeB (gNB) through the core network. This causes unnecessary delays and resource consumption that could otherwise be avoided. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize intra-RAN UE communication by introducing “shortcuts” at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of the gNB. By enabling direct data forwarding between UEs connected to the same RAN, the proposed approach reduces end-to-end latency. This is achieved by bypassing higher layers in the gNB and the core network for eligible traffic. A proof-of-concept implementation by modifying the MAC layer of the srsRAN project, an open-source 5G RAN, demonstrates the viability of such an approach. The implementation and further analysis demonstrate measurable end-to-end latency reduction and improved consistency. Such an approach holds significant potential for optimizing intra-RAN UE communication."

While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security work-flows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G."

    "abstract": "Time Interleaved Analog to Digital Converters (TI-ADCs) are widely used in wideband spectrum monitoring systems to achieve high sampling rates and large instantaneous bandwidths. However, as highlighted in the literature, accurately compensating for inter-channel mismatches such as gain, offset, and timing skew, is critical, as these impairments can distort the digitized signal. While traditional studies focus on spectral analysis under ideal sinusoidal inputs, this work examines the direct impact of TI-ADC mismatches on Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) accuracy. Using a publicly available dataset of IQ-modulated signals, we introduce controlled mismatch impairments and evaluate classification performance across varying distortion levels, from relaxed to extreme. We propose a lightweight dyadic down-sampling scheme combined with a CNN-based fusion architecture that improves robustness of AMC to interleaving mismatches and calibration drift. Results show up to 6.7 percent improvement in classification accuracy under severe mismatch conditions, underscoring the method’s consistent gains and robustness to hardware distortions. These findings are particularly relevant for field-deployed or long-duration monitoring applications where hardware degradation and limited recalibration are expected."

But conventional orthogonal multiple access strategies limit the effectual use of the available spectrum. Here, we proposed the innovative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based hybrid spectrum access system to be integrated with 6G-enabled cognitive IoT (C-IoT) Even during the active transmission of the Primary User (P-U), the use of NOMA allows the C-IoT to access free and busy bands. Two types of methodologies for uplink resource allocation for the C-IoT are proposed in this paper. This method tries to make best use of the average aggregate rate of transmission of the C-IoT, and thus guarantee the smallest rate of transmission for the P- U and each C-IoT node and each cluster to send arc on circle nobility hybrid spectrum access depends on the NOMA protocol having more benefits and rate guarantees for clustering NOMA-based C-IoT are demonstrated and compared by the simulation results."

This article introduces GeNetE, a Generative Network Environments framework, for creating a Specialized Small Language Model (SSLM) by fine-tuning open-weight LLMs using synthetic, domain-specific datasets. GeNetE enables streamlined emulator use, runs efficiently on low-resource devices, and reduces user workload. GeNetE was extensively evaluated using the Mininet emulator, employing various model sizes and quantization techniques, achieving approximately 60% valid Software-Defined Network environment generation with a compact 2.4 GB model, underscoring its potential for accessible and efficient network testing."

This paper actually describes a multiclass classification system based on the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and YOLOv8 that can be used to segment the image with the goal of fractured bone detection; that is, to automate the bone fracture diagnosis. We tested CNN models of EfficientNetV2, Xception, and MobileNetV3 on an image dataset of X-rays and obtained results of 93.49, 88.14, and 89.42 with EfficientNetV2 which is the best among the models.

The integration of these methods yielded great enhancements in the classification as well as the localization and offered an efficient and accurate means of detecting and segmenting bone fractures.

Specifically, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), plants were detected and classified as medicinal plants based on images of the plant and therefore very accurately. A novel dataset of medicinal plants was created with labeled images of the plants. The dataset of medicinal plants was used to train and test the model. The Medical Plant Detection System can identify individuals of a particular plant species under varying conditions, exhibiting reliability in each scenario. Therefore, the plant detection system is a beneficial tool for researchers, health care practitioners, and conservationists studying medicinal plants.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel bi-level optimization framework for addressing multi-user channel estimation and dynamic resource allocation problems jointly in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). As RIS is emerging as a key technology for 6G communication, its deployment in dynamic, obstructed environments alongside base stations aims to enhance spectral efficiency while minimizing power consumption. However, traditional resource allocation becomes challenging when user equipment (UE) positions are uncertain and the wireless environment is non-stationary. To address this, the developed bi-level optimization can effectively integrate dynamic resource allocation and multi-user channel estimation in RIS-assisted wireless networks into a unified framework and solve them simultaneously. Specifically, multi-UE dynamic channel estimation is formulated at the lower level, whereas transmit power and RIS phase shift optimization are formulated at the upper level. Due to the hierarchical nature of bi-level framework, the lower level estimates uncertain wireless channels, which are then utilized in the upper level for joint optimization of resource parameters. To ensure robustness against worst-case estimation errors, a zero-sum game formulation is introduced at the upper level, enabling reliable transmission power allocation and RIS phase shifts. Next, a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) scheme is developed, where the upper level employs an online actor-critic RL algorithm for dynamic resource allocation, while the lower level uses a neural network-based estimator for channel estimation and multi-user localization."

The design aims to generate a high-speed direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with high precision and high performance for signal sources. By employing a pipelined phase accumulator, working speed is increased effectively. A ROM compression structure is also used in order to reduce hardware resource consumption, and some optimization techniques such as dithering injection and spur cancellation are utilized to improve spectral purity. To boost the output frequency further, a dual-channel DDS structure combining with a doubled frequency control word and a $2: 1$ multiplexer is employed. Simulation results show that the operating frequency can be up to 500 MHz and a 12-bit output signal with a frequency resolution of 0.1397 Hz and phase resolution of $8.382 \\times 10^{-80}$ can be achieved. The power consumption is about 17.58 mW under 1.2 V power supply voltage at 500 MHz working frequency. This DDS is expected to provide a high - precision, high - frequency and low power frequency source."

This work presents a comparative analysis of attacker activity collected from three secure shell honeypot deployments: Cowrie, Heralding, and a Raspberry Pi-based low-interaction system. IP-based profiles have been extracted using features such as total login sessions and days active, and then K-means clustering has been applied to uncover common behavioral patterns. The resulting clusters reveal clear distinctions between short-lived probes, opportunistic attackers, and long-term brute-force campaigns. Additionally, we highlight representative attacker profiles to illustrate the differences across systems and show how behavioral profiling can support broader defensive strategies. Finally, we discuss how this clustering approach can complement deception-based defenses and how it could be integrated into a Zero Trust Architecture to inform trust decisions. This work paves a way to explore honeypot deployments across geographically distributed networks and the use of multi-node honeynets to track attacker movement and behaviors through a system."

Among NTN platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are especially promising due to their rapid deployability. However, this shift from fixed, wired base stations (BSs) to mobile, wireless, energy-constrained UAV-BSs introduces unique security challenges. Their central role in emergency communications makes them attractive candidates for emergency alert spoofing. Their limited computing and energy resources make them more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and their dependence on wireless backhaul links and GNSS navigation exposes them to jamming, interception, and spoofing. Furthermore, UAV mobility opens new attack vectors such as malicious handover manipulation. This paper identifies several attack surfaces of UAV-BS systems and outlines principles for mitigating their threats."

    "abstract": "Cyberbullying on social media continues to escalate due to the rapid growth of user-generated content and the ease of anonymous communication. Accurately identifying harmful behaviour remains challenging because of informal writing styles, overlapping aggression types, and highly imbalanced data distributions. This paper proposes a Deep Multi-Modal Framework for cyberbullying detection that fuses textual features with behavioural indicators to enhance classification performance. The textual branch employs a hybrid CNN– BiLSTM encoder, while behavioural cues such as sentiment polarity, punctuation intensity, and lexical aggression scores are processed through a dense projection network. Extensive experiments were conducted on a large-scale Kaggle cyberbullying dataset and evaluated against traditional machine-learning models, deep neural networks, and transformer-based architectures. Baseline machine-learning models achieved moderate results, with SVM reaching an accuracy of 0.84. Deep learning architectures improved performance substantially, with the CNN–BiLSTM model attaining 0.93 accuracy. Transformer-based models such as BERT and RoBERTa further enhanced performance, achieving accuracies of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. The proposed multi-modal fusion model outperformed all baseline approaches, achieving an accuracy of 0.96, precision of 0.96, recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.96. These findings demonstrate that integrating behavioural and semantic information yields a more robust and reliable strategy for cyberbullying detection on social media platforms."

    "abstract": "In emerging networked systems, mobile edge devices such as ground vehicles and unmanned aerial system (UAS) swarms collectively aggregate vast amounts of data to make machine learning decisions such as threat detection in remote, dynamic, and infrastructure-constrained environments where power and bandwidth are scarce. Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server, distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber threats."

For the NextG, it is proposed in this paper that the UE find its location itself instead of the gNodeB by using only down link (DL) positioning reference signals (PRSs), PRS is always available at a UE because multiple gNodeBs broadcast their PRSs periodically. Thus, the proposed method does not require the UE to transmit its UL SRS and other feedback signals. Therefore, the proposed method can be beneficial and useful in the battle field because it is dangerous to expose the location of a UE to an adversary gNodeB or a fake base station. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method under amplify-and-forward (AF) relay jamming by analyzing the probability of detection (PD) before and after the AF relay jamming removal for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth W, finally we present an example of location estimation accuracy."

Ensuring continuous service delivery under adversarial conditions is a fundamental goal of Zero Trust Architectures (ZTA) for Future G. This paper presents an integrated framework that combines stochastic cyberattack modeling with cost-constrained survivability optimization to enhance resilience in 6G mission-critical networks. We extend the methodology to 6G radio access networks (RAN) and core infrastructures by building upon validated survivability models for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and stochastic attack rate prediction. We also incorporate redundancy allocation strategies and series-parallel reliability modeling. Cyber-attacks are characterized by using stochastic processes such as Poisson and negative binomial distributions to predict attack rates and dynamically update trust scores within ZTA policy engines. The proposed approach is supported by comparative analysis, including numerical insights from prior validated studies and literature benchmarks. The framework aligns with 3GPP security enhancements for 6G and offers a pathway toward unbreakable resilience in Zero Trust-enabled mission-critical networks."

The proposed approach addresses the challenge of reduced RX gain under lower reference voltages by increasing the bias current via an additional current path. This adjustment leads to improved RX gain performance at lower reference voltages. Furthermore, an offset calibration scheme is applied to the RX. Unlike the conventional major voting method, this approach enables the removal of offset in all signal paths, specifically for each internal DQ path, which is captured and divided by the DQS path. As a result, a reduction in offset by over 80% was achieved, as demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations. Implementing this scheme results in an 11% improvement in RX timing margin and a 23% enhancement in voltage margin."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity and interconnectivity of cyber-physical systems pose challenges to real-time decision making, resource optimization, and security. Existing systems usually fail to incorporate autonomous robotics, IoT networks, and intelligent energy management with secure, adaptable operation. This project envisions a next-generation AI-enabled cyber-physical ecosystem that overcomes such challenges through the integration of autonomous robot and drone swarms, distributed IoT sensors, cloud computing, smart energy modules, sophisticated cybersecurity, and brain-computer interfacing. Multi-modal AI architectures analyze real-time data for predictive analysis and adaptable system behavior, while multi-agent reinforcement learning coordinates autonomous agents to perform tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster management, logistics, and smart city operations. Firebase facilitates secure, real-time data storage with cross-platform accessibility, and a brain-computer interface facilitates the direct neural control of devices. The innovation in this system is the fully autonomous, cloud-united platform that offers intelligent, predictive, and secure management to future smart ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Sharing data at the edge with situational awareness systems like the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) can enable powerful real-time common operating pictures on mobile phones and tablets, but there is often no substitute for voice communications to clearly and unambiguously relay certain types of critical information. Unfortunately, verbal communication quickly becomes inefficient or infeasible when in multinational operations where there is no common spoken language or where accents prevent effective communication. Further, many tactical networks are too limited or too overloaded to be able to provide consistent team-wide voice comms, even in a single language. It is in this context that we present the TAK Transcription and Automated Language Kit (TAK TALK) as a mechanism to achieve voice communications over constrained tactical networks, even in the presence of multiparty, multilingual deployment settings. TAK TALK capitalizes on recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) for automated speech to text, machine translation, text to speech and voice cloning, to achieve a capability that emulates true voice conversations using only a very small fraction of the bandwidth of traditional mechanisms. Here we present TAK TALK, explore its key systems and the ML models that underpin them, evaluate its efficiency and efficacy, compare those results to the state of the art in today’s voice communications, and examine the new possibilities that text-based audio transmission enables."

    "abstract": "As Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely applied in modern society, IoT devices (IoTDs) and their various applications are dramatically improving people's daily lives. IoTDs usually require considerable sufficient energy amounts to maintain normal functions. Based on far-field wireless charging technique, tremendous existing studies have proposed to employ conventional cellular base stations (BSs) to wirelessly charge their surrounding IoTDs. However, when the charging distance between a BS and an IoTD is relatively long, the BS's charging efficiency decreases accordingly. Therefore, from both academia and industry, it is still crucial to improve the farfield wireless efficiency to achieve the practical and convenient wireless charging. In this work, we adopt a green energy powered wireless charging vehicle (WCV) to effectively power the IoTDs in wireless charging IoT network. We propose a nonlinear energy conversion model to accurately calculate the received wireless power of the IoTDs. In order to extend the lifespan of IoT network, we aim to minimize the sleep time of IoTDs by reducing the WCV's traveling distance. Since this sleep time minimization problem is proved to be NP-hard, we further propose the One-to-Multiple charGing (OMG) algorithm to efficiently solve it. Extensive simulations have validated that our proposed algorithm exhibits obvious advantages in terms of shortening the total sleep time of the IoTDs."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases among women, where early detection plays a crucial role in reducing mortality rates. Ultrasound imaging has emerged as a widely used, cost-effective, and non-invasive diagnostic tool, though its interpretation is often challenging due to noise and operator dependency. To address these challenges, this study proposes a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for automated breast cancer classification using the BUSI dataset. The dataset comprises 780 ultrasound images categorized into normal, benign, and malignant cases, supplemented with ground truth annotations. The proposed CNN incorporates multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling operations, dropout regularization, and dense layers to achieve robust feature extraction and classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates strong performance, achieving 95.45% overall accuracy with precision, recall, and F1-scores above 92% across all classes. Training and validation performance trends confirm the model’s generalization ability, while the confusion matrix highlights its effectiveness in distinguishing between visually similar lesion types. These findings establish the proposed CNN as a lightweight, efficient, and clinically applicable model for breast cancer diagnosis, offering potential as a decision-support system in healthcare environments."

    "abstract": "A simple transceiver design is essential for achieving low computational complexity, low power consumption, and cost-effectiveness in beyond 5G (B5G) wireless systems. However, these architectures introduce hardware impairments that can significantly compromise the performance reliability of transmissions. This paper delves into the problem of in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance hardware impairment at transmitter (Tx) for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), which is a recent promising waveform for potential use in B5G communications systems. A novel pilot allocation strategy is proposed to mitigate the impact of Tx IQ imbalance in delay-Doppler (DD) domain. Specifically, this scheme aims to circumvent the physical impact of mirror-Doppler interference (MDI) caused by IQ imbalance at TX so that wireless channel estimation in DD domain is successfully performed despite the presence of IQ imbalance. Different from classical IQ imbalance estimators based on iterative methodologies, the proposed pilot location in DD domain eliminates the need for additional signal processing stages, and avoids substantial losses in spectral efficiency. The obtained results validate the robustness of the proposed pilot location strategy in various practical scenarios, showcasing its superiority over conventional pilot allocation strategies in DD bin."

    "abstract": "The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing, between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi) data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy, showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion."

ATO includes requirement creation, selection, implementation, and satisfaction. Because each step of ATO involves multiple stakeholders, any disconnect between stakeholders can lead to approval difficulties and delay. When these miscommunications compound, they undermine the main goal of the ATO process: to ensure that only secure systems are deployed. In order to addresses these difficulties, this paper proposes to augment the ATO process with formal methods to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of deployed systems. In particular, we first introduce the traditional ATO process and its main stakeholders. We then introduce formal methods and their role to improve ATO. Finally, we apply our enhanced ATO architecture on the Cyber-Hardened Satellite Software (CHSS), satellite flight control software developed by AFRL/RV and MIT LL, to demonstrate how our work illuminates gaps in the traditional ATO process, aids in better communication between stakeholders, and provides formalized security guarantees."

The graph structure induces Markovian dependencies in data sampling, leading to biased updates and slow convergence. We propose a decentralized and asynchronous data shuffling framework to address this issue. Inspired by the Ising model, our method uses Glauber dynamics to guide local data swaps among connected nodes based on an energy function defined via the total variation distance between nodes’ neighborhood label distribution and the uniform distribution. The algorithm shuffles the data with the goal of approximating a uniform label distribution in each node’s neighborhood. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that our method can significantly improve convergence and accuracy, approaching centralized performance."

    "abstract": "Network attacks (e.g., distributed denial of service (DDoS), worms, and botnets) have become serious threats to the Internet. To mitigate these threats, network systems increasingly utilize machine learning (ML) models to analyze network traffic (e.g., packet rates and traffic volumes), detecting anomalies related to attacks. However, these ML-based methods normally fail to detect multi-vector attacks, where a single malicious network traffic simultaneously exhibits multiple attack characteristics. The key bottleneck is that the network traffic datasets are predominantly single-vector (i.e., one attack type per traffic). In this paper, we design a novel framework that can generate diverse multi-label datasets to facilitate attack detection by only leveraging existing single-vector datasets. The key idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the single-vector network traffic, learning the underlying statistical characteristics of each individual attack. Through advanced prompt engineering, our framework can generate network traffic exhibiting the statistical characteristics of real-world multi-vector attacks. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets show that the generated network traffic can build ML models for effective multi-vector attack detection."

While it has been widely explored over the past 25 years, many common assumptions are not aligned with the realities of 5G networks. In this paper, we consider the CR problem for the following setup: (i) infrastructure-based systems, where downlink transmissions might occur to Receivers (Rxs) whose positions are not, or not exactly, known; (ii) multi-beam antennas at both primary and secondary base stations. We formulate a detailed protocol to determine when secondary transmissions into different beam directions can interfere with primary users at potential locations and create probability-based interference rules. We then analyze the \"catastrophic interference\" probability and the \"missed transmission opportunity\" probability, as well as the achievable throughput, as a function of the transmit powers of the primary and secondary base stations and the sensing window of the secondary base station. Results can serve to more realistically assess the spectral efficiency gains in 5G infrastructure-based cognitive systems."

Federal organizations have established regulatory frameworks to manage shared commercial use alongside mission-critical operations, such as military communications. This paper investigates the potential of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to enhance spectrum sharing capabilities within the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band, specifically focusing on the coexistence of commercial signals (e.g., 5G) and military radar systems. We demonstrate that ML techniques can potentially extend the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-recommended signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) boundaries by improving radar detection and waveform identification in high-interference environments. Through rigorous evaluation using both synthetic and real-world signals, our findings indicate that proposed ML models, utilizing In-phase/Quadrature (IQ) data and spectrograms, can achieve the FCC-recommended 99% radar detection accuracy even when subjected to high interference from 5G signals upto -5dB SINR, exceeding the required limits of 20 SINR. Our experimental studies distinguish this work from the state-of-the-art by significantly extending the SINR limit for 99% radar detection accuracy from approximately 12 dB down to −5 dB. Subsequent to detection, we further apply ML to analyze and identify radar waveforms. The proposed models also demonstrate the capability to classify six distinct radar waveform types with 93% accuracy."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the nonlinear and coupling characteristics of small-scale DC V2G systems under conditions of limited number of electric vehicles, frequent load disturbances, and battery parameter drift. A model-based stability analysis and adaptive power coordination control method is proposed. First, a system state-space model is established, incorporating the bus, electric vehicle energy storage units, DC/DC converters, and load dynamics. Theoretically, bounded disturbance assumptions and parameter uncertainties are taken into account. This is used to build a framework for Lyapunov stability analysis and to establish an adaptive gain convergence rule that uses fixed-point theory to dynamically modify the control gain. This function guarantees the system's overall stability in the face of time-varying disruptions. Second, a weighted optimization goal function is provided, taking into account inter-vehicle power imbalance and global voltage variation, based on a model-driven power coordination mechanism. An adaptive law is used to optimize power allocation in real time. On the MATLAB/Simulink platform, a small-scale V2G simulation model involving five electric vehicles is created. The rated bus voltage is 400 V, the load power fluctuates between 2 and 6 kW, the battery has a 12 kWh capacity, and the state of charge (SOC) ranges from 60% to 90%. According to experimental results, the algorithm described in this study is more robust and stable under situations of parameter drift and load rapid changes than the conventional MPC, PSO-MPC, and IWOA-MPC approaches. Specifically, when the load increases from 3 kW to 5 kW, the steady-state deviation of the bus is reduced by approximately 85%, the voltage fluctuation amplitude is reduced by 40%, and the system peak current decreases by 12.7%. The system can sustain a convergence error of less than 10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> even with parameter uncertainties of ±12%. The uniqueness and convergence of the adaptive law under fixed-point theory are confirmed by the gain's simultaneous convergence to the steady-state value K* = 0.832I."

    "abstract": "Soldiers operating in harsh battlefield environments face extreme temperature variations, which can lead to discomfort, fatigue, and reduced operational effectiveness. To address this challenge, this work presents a Smart Solar-Driven E-Uniform equipped with an autonomous climate control system that maintains thermal comfort while minimizing external power dependence. The proposed uniform integrates flexible solar panels for on-body energy harvesting, a rechargeable battery storage module, and a NodeMCU-based microcontroller system that monitors ambient temperature using a digital sensor. Depending on real-time environmental conditions, the controller activates either micro cooling fans for ventilation in hot climates or resistive heating pads for warmth in cold conditions. The system architecture ensures energy-efficient operation by prioritizing renewable power use and switching dynamically between heating and cooling modes. Experimental evaluation demonstrated stable temperature regulation, reliable mode switching, and extended runtime supported by solar energy, reducing the need for external charging sources. The results indicate that the system enhances soldier comfort and endurance while contributing to sustainable and mobile power solutions. This research highlights the potential for integrating wearable renewable energy systems with intelligent climate management to improve operational readiness in defense applications."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied in many applications such as social networks, recommendation systems and cybersecurity. However, the impact of adversarial attacks on GNNs is a prevalent problem. Previous research shows that GNNs have adversarial vulnerabilities due to a minor perturbation of graph data can lead to poor performance outcomes for these models. Our research investigates the transferability of GNN’s robustness against adversarial vulnerabilities to different GNN architectures through transfer learning. This method examines how adversarial information can propagate across different GNN models, while investigating methods to develop robustness of the model. Our approach begins with a graph convolutional network (GCN) trained on an adversarial dataset which showcases its specific vulnerabilities. We then create a robust graph-attention network (GAT) model that are expected to be more resistant to adversarial perturbations. In training the model on an adversarial dataset, we assess its robustness while working towards improving its adversarial defenses. We also apply meta-learning at the target-side model to improve its adaptability and further develop the model’s defenses. Our research aims to improve the adversarial robustness of GAT, contributing to developing more effective defenses for applications involving graph-based data protection."

Existing optimization and control methods generally fails with scalability, uncertainty, and nonlinear dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) provide efficient tools to manage high-dimensional data and extract hidden patterns, yet their black-box nature and dependency on large datasets limit their use in safety critical domains. To overcome these challenges, Constraint aware DL (CADL) and Constraint Aware Deep Q Learning (CADQL) model is presented that have embedding physical laws, conservation principles, and engineering constraints directly into DL model. This hybrid model enhances robustness, adaptability, provides better forecasting, control, and decision-making. Empirical studies report substantial improvements: forecasting error reduced by 65%, operational costs decreased by 11%, enhances renewable utilization by 10%, and carbon emissions reduced by 26%. With respect to learning with domain knowledge, the CADQL provided a scalable pathway toward sustainable, resilient, and cost effective IES management. This supports global efforts in renewable integration and carbon reduction."

This paper proposes UAV-based federated learning (FL) optimized over-the-air computation (AirComp) schemes for CF massive-MIMO mobile networks. To tackle the model aggregation errors that undermine FL accuracy, our schemes jointly optimize mobile users’ (MUs) transmit power, access points’ (APs) receiving vectors, central processing unit’s (CPU) large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) weight, and UAV locations under power and receiver constraints. Using the fully connected signal path inherent in CF massive-MIMO, we cast the entire mobile networks as a trainable neural network whose parameters correspond to the physical transceiver coefficients. Using preconfigured pilot symbols, a forward–backward training procedure directly learns power allocation and combines coefficients without channel estimation, thus simplifying design and reducing signaling overhead. The extensive simulations obtained confirm that our proposed schemes can accelerate FL convergence, enhance mobile networks robustness under high levels of noise, and outperform conventional two-stage optimization baselines, validating our developed FL optimized AirComp over UAV-based CF massive-MIMO mobile networks."

Prior work has focused on exploiting the frequency-reconfigurability property of a DMA in a cellular network setting. We propose DMAs to enable frequency-reconfigurable mobile adhoc networks (MANETs). We envision devices in an adhoc network equipped with DMAs that have the ability to dynamically change the operating frequency within a feasible range depending on the DMA design. We propose a dynamic operating frequency selection approach that reduces interference in an adhoc network compared to the case when all devices operate in the same band. To maximize the signal-to-interference- and-noise ratio (SINR), we optimize the per-element resonant frequencies of the DMA using a gradient-ascent based technique. We use ray-traced channels to perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the adhoc network. We show that the normalized transmission capacity, i.e., the number of successful transmissions per unit area per unit frequency, increases with the DMA tuning range using our proposed optimization. The DMA with wider tuning range is more energy-efficient compared to a fully-digital receiver."

Wi-Fi and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, ubiquitously available on a multitude of wireless devices, offer rich and accessible data sources highly correlated with the ambient environment, making them ideal for I/O classification. Despite this potential, to date, there has been a notable absence of live, on-device I/O classification. In this work, we address this critical gap by implementing real-time I/O classification on a mobile device within the SigCap Android application. We leverage two distinct methodologies: a robust machine learning approach utilizing multiple Random Forest models (trained on Wi-Fi, GNSS, and combined features) and a computationally efficient threshold-based method (relying on per-satellite GNSS RSSI thresholds). This work details the implementation of both methods, alongside a comparative analysis in terms of computational complexity, memory footprint, scalability, and configurability, highlighting the practical challenges and solutions for deploying advanced classification capabilities in a mobile environment."

Through comparisons with agent-based simulation results, we validate the accuracy of our dynamical model across various stochastic games, population structures, and algorithm parameters. Our research thus provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into the effects of state transition rules and graph topologies in population dynamics. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, state transitions can significantly promote the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. We also explored the effects of agent degree on cooperation, and unlike previous findings, we show that this can have either positive or negative implications for cooperation depending on the transition rules."

This complex and dynamic problem requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to evolving warfare environment. While our previous work addressed the static NADP problem by proposing a mathematical model and heuristic solutions for sensor allocation, engagement scheduling, and ship routing, this study extends to the dynamic NADP problem. Unlike the static version, which assumes complete knowledge of future threats, the dynamic NADP problem requires continuous updates and real-time adjustments to decisions as new threats emerge and situational parameters change. We present modifications in the mathematical formulation, which is based on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, alongside a comprehensive simulation structure. We employ heuristic solution approaches that utilize a combination of a genetic algorithm, construction of an engagement graph to solve the shortest path problem, and dynamic programming (DP) techniques. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing the dynamic NADP problem. The study also explores machine learning models for threat prioritization, offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by dynamic naval air defense scenarios."

Although considerable recognition performance has been achieved by existing palmprint learning methods, they generally require the use of substantial labeled datasets and involve substantial computational overhead for feature learning. In this article, we propose a novel multilayer projection learning (MLPL) method to achieve efficient palmprint feature learning and recognition. First, we transform the palmprint images into their direction-specific representations by computing the difference in the multiple directional responses. Then, we learn three layers of feature projections for robust feature learning, including low-rank projection for image noise decoupling, feature projection for discriminative feature exploration, and quantization projection for information preservation during feature encoding. With multilayer feature projections, palmprint images can be transformed into discriminative feature representations through a single-step process for efficient palmprint recognition. Moreover, we extend the proposed MLPL, referred to as E-MLPL, by minimizing the representation discrepancy between heterogeneous palmprint images to make it applicable for heterogeneous palmprint recognition. The results obtained from five widely adopted databases confirm the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency."

Here we introduced a tongue-computer interface capable of speech recognition that do not relay on vocal cords, throat or face, which only based on the surface electromyography (sEMG) of tongue by using a soft electrode array. A Multiscale Attention Fusion - Temporal Convolutional Networks (MSAF-TCNet), was designed for silent speech recognition of tongue sEMG, integrating input features, channel attention, and spatial attention to adaptively handle attention features at different scales, achieving more comprehensive and balanced feature representations. Quantitative results show that the model achieved average recognition accuracies of 88.4% and 78.6% on the daily sentence dataset and phoneme dataset from seven participants, respectively; qualitative observations indicate that the tongue-computer interface can work stably in noisy environments due to its independence from acoustic signals, and can realize silent speech recognition only through tongue movements. The combination of the tongue-computer interface and neural network optimization provides a highly promising solution for silent speech recognition that requires no sound production and relies only on tongue movements."

The surface is excited using a single conductor powered resonant coil, which provides good passive voltage gain at -16 dBm input power. A secondary resonant coil is employed to amplify voltage variations caused by human touch on the surface. The system delivers a high voltage output signal that can be directly interfaced with a computing platform through an analog to digital converter (ADC), thereby eliminating the need for external amplifiers or analog filters.

    "abstract": "The key objective of the Quantum Internet is the distribution and manipulation of entanglement to enable unprecedented applications. This requires a radical departure from classical Internet design principles, such as the end-to-end argument, due to the inherently stateful and non-local nature of entanglement, which demands coordinated in-network operations and persistent state awareness. To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical Quantum Internet architecture centered on the concept of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Entanglement-Defined Controller</i> (EDC).

While necessary, this separation is insufficient to manage entanglement resources, requiring a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">quantum-native control plane</i>.

    "abstract": "Conventional space-borne antenna shaping designs predominantly rely on a pre-defined reflector geometry, which lacks the capability to adapt to varying multi-stage service requirements once in orbit. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an active shaping method for space-borne membrane reflector antennas (MRA) through coordinated control of electrostatic forces and boundary cable tensions. A coupled structural-electromagnetic model is established that integrates the nonlinear finite element method for structural mechanics and the physical optics approach for radiation analysis, capturing the interactions between actuation forces, reflector morphology, and far-field performance. With electrostatic voltages and cable tensions as design variables, an optimization model is formulated to minimize the root mean square error of the directivity at sample points within the target coverage region. Numerical simulations conducted on a 30-meter aperture MRA demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, achieving an average directivity improvement of approximately 2.67 times after active shaping. The approach provides a feasible strategy for in-orbit reconfiguration of membrane reflector antennas to accommodate dynamic mission profiles and was verified through experiments with 5-meter electrostatically formed MRA."

One of the components that support this process are firewalls, particularly web application firewalls (WAFs). These tools are responsible for detecting and blocking potential attacks coming from user traffic. Their proper security configuration (usage of appropriate blocking rules) is behind this crucial task, which is often marginal. One method of verifying such a configuration is using fuzz tests, but they have some drawbacks. In this work, we investigated the effectiveness of WAF configurations in the context of cross site scripting attacks (XSS) with an agent using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach.For this purpose, we created a suitable test environment with six different types of WAFs (e.g., ModSecurity, Naxsi, and SafeLine) and we conducted several experiments using the RL agent to check whether it is possible to bypass attack detection by the application firewall. Moreover, we compared the effectiveness of the RL agent with five web application fuzzers to verify whether it is capable of finding more effective payloads that can bypass WAF detection. The results allow us to conclude that using the RL concept and fuzzing can be an appropriate method for verifying the efficacy of WAF configurations."

    "abstract": "Safety guarantee is a fundamental requirement for numerous dynamical systems. In this work, the safe stabilization problem in complex scenarios is considered. First, we introduce the notion of the local safe set, a convex and compact set disjoint from unsafe regions, to construct a finite sequence of such sets. Next, we leverage Zubov’s theorem to propose the Zubov barrier function (Zubov BF), which provides safety guarantees on local safe sets. Compared with the existing ones, the Zubov BF reduces the conservatism and complexity in safety analysis. The relations between the Zubov BF and existing ones are discussed to show the generality of Zubov BF. The Zubov control barrier function (Zubov CBF) is further extended for control synthesis. Sufficient and necessary conditions are provided to verify the existence of the derived controller. To achieve the safe stabilization objective, we provide a modified quadratic programming (QP) framework with feasibility guarantee and demonstrate the continuity of the derived controller in closed form. Finally, a numerical example from the overtaking problem of two autonomous vehicles and a practical experiment on the safe navigation for a quadrotor are provided to illustrate the derived results."

    "abstract": "Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) is widely used for detecting and locating local defects in power cables. However, noise, multiple reflections, and spectral leakage can generate spurious peaks and sidelobes in the FDR spectrum, which may mislead defect localization. Moreover, FDR testing requires the collection of a large volume of data, placing high demands on on-site storage and real-time processing. This study proposes a compressed sensing (CS)-based method for defect localization in power cables. The method first preprocesses the raw signal using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and windowing and performs compressed sampling with a sparse random measurement matrix, after which the signal is reconstructed and preliminarily denoised under the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis, followed by sparse reconstruction under the Chirp Z-Transform (CZT) basis to obtain a sparse representation. Simulations and field tests verify that the proposed method maintains high localization accuracy even under high compression ratios, while effectively suppressing spurious peaks and sidelobe interference."

    "abstract": "Flexible resources (FRs) including battery energy storage systems, hydrogen energy storage systems, and electric vehicles can effectively enhance the resilience of power distribution networks (PDNs) during extreme weather events. However, the high-impact, low-probability (HILP) nature of extreme weather events creates challenges in accurately assessing spatial temporal risk. Moreover, the complex interplay among PDN and multiple FRs introduces challenges in effectively incentivizing FRs to enhance PDN resilience. To address these issues, we apply the tail-focused risk measure known as Entropic Value at-Risk (EVaR) to assess the spatial-temporal risk of energy not supplied. In addition to the wholesale price, we develop a dynamic EVaR-based price adder designed to encourage multiple FRs to deliver resilience-enhancing services when risks are identified. This approach can mitigate supply shortfall risks by facilitating spatial-temporal FR power injection into the PDN, incentivized by the price adder. Case studies show that the EVaR risk measure is sensitive to HILP events, and the proposed pricing framework effectively incentivizes FRs to provide resilience-enhancing services at high-risk nodes and during critical intervals."

    "abstract": "Fully-supervised category-level pose estimation aims to determine the 6-DoF poses of unseen instances from known categories, requiring expensive manual labeling costs. Recently, various self-supervised category-level pose estimation methods have been proposed to reduce the requirement of the annotated datasets. However, most methods rely on synthetic data or 3D CAD model, and they are typically limited to addressing single-object pose problems without considering multi-objective tasks or shape reconstruction. To overcome these challenges and limitations, we introduce a diffusion-driven self-supervised network for multi-object shape reconstruction and categorical pose estimation, only leveraging the shape priors. Specifically, to capture the SE(3)-equivariant pose features and 3D scale-invariant shape information, we present a Prior-Aware Pyramid 3D Point Transformer. This module adopts a point convolutional layer with radial-kernels for pose-aware learning and a 3D scale-invariant graph convolution layer for object-level shape representation. Furthermore, we introduce a Pretrain-to-Refine Self-Supervised Training Paradigm to train our network. It enables proposed network to capture the associations between shape priors and observations, addressing the challenge of intra-class shape variations by utilising the diffusion mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets and a self-built dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised category-level baselines and even surpasses some fully-supervised instance-level and category-level methods."

The irreversible demagnetization can be induced by high temperature, opposing magnetic fields, or mechanical stress. While Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is highly accurate in predicting the irreversible demagnetization, it is computationally expensive and inefficient for the early design stage, where repeated geometric changes and parametric studies are often required. In this study, a Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC)-based approach is proposed to efficiently assess the risk of partial demagnetization in the Permanent Magnets (PMs). The method enables localized analysis by dividing the magnet into structurally weak subregions, such as ribs and bridges, and evaluating whether demagnetization is likely to occur in each area. The proposed technique offers a fast and practical solution to identify demagnetization-prone regions in the initial design phase of railway IPMSM."

The proposed system leverages on-off keying (OOK) signaling in combination with randomly modulated transmitter-side phases to generate a secure, channel-dependent detection pattern. This modulation technique causes the energy detector output of the A-IoT receiver to be highly sensitive to the unique properties of the wireless channel. Through a training stage, the transmitter learns a one-to-one mapping between transmitted sequences and observed binary outcomes, forming a secure codebook without requiring channel state information (CSI). To handle sparse multipath, random pre-filtering further enlarges the security gap. Analytical derivations and simulations show strong agreement, demonstrating a clear key disagreement rate (KDR) gap between legitimate devices and eavesdroppers under both rich and sparse multipath channels."

    "abstract": "This article addresses the distributed global prescribed-performance control problem for uncertain Lagrangian dynamics, with a particular emphasis on minimizing steady-state error oscillations. A novel global distributed prescribed-performance control framework is proposed based on a dynamic funnel function and neural network design. Specifically, by integrating funnel barrier properties and derivative information, a new neural network learning law is developed. Furthermore, a projection operator is incorporated into the learning law to guarantee the boundedness of the weight estimates in the stability proof, ultimately avoiding potential constraint incompatibility problems caused by neural network integration. The established control framework ensures that the trajectory consensus error of robotic manipulators under distributed control satisfies global arbitrary convergence rates and steady-state error bounds while leveraging neural network approximation to mitigate the inherent uncertainties of controllers that do not require precise mathematical model, thereby effectively suppressing steady-state error oscillations. Unlike existing literature, this work pioneers the incorporation of neural networks into distributed funnel control, achieving global prescribed performance while significantly reducing steady-state error oscillations. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

We propose CFSCNet, a novel model that integrates multimodal signals—audio, nasal airflow, and tri-axial accelerometry—to enhance swallowing event segmentation. The model employs a dual-stream architecture to capture swallowing information across varying durations and utilizes an exponential moving average-based cost-sensitive weighting method to address data imbalance. To further improve the stability of predictions for clinical applications, a Swallowing State Machine-Driven Post-Processing Method is introduced to smooth the segmentation sequences. CFSCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, reaching an AUC of 89.83 on the HRCA dataset and 94.10 on the SMSD dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods. Built on a series of tailored methodological innovations, the proposed framework offers a comprehensive and novel solution for swallowing event segmentation. It demonstrates strong accuracy and reliability, as well as great potential for future extension and clinical translation. This work is expected to advance high-precision detection and diagnosis of dysphagia, thereby supporting more effective swallowing rehabilitation and medical interventions."

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are being increasingly utilized for critical applications. CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces, which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured, but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system (OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other anomaly detection methods."

In this work, we present a three-stage framework that integrates feature engineering, baseline machine learning, and heterogeneous graph neural networks (H-GNNs) for drug repurposing. The system constructs a heterogeneous graph consisting of drugs, proteins, and diseases, where edges represent pharmacological and biological interactions. Drug features are derived from SMILES strings using cheminformatics tools, while protein and disease features are extracted from network-based properties. A baseline XGBoost model is trained on these features to establish reference performance. Building on this, a heterogeneous GAT-based encoder and MLP predictor are employed to capture high-order structural relationships within the graph. The framework also incorporates a prediction module that dynamically adds unseen disease nodes and identifies potential candidate drugs. Experimental results on benchmark biomedical datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional feature-based and shallow models, while also ensuring scalability to large biomedical networks. This highlights the potential of graph-based deep learning in advancing computational drug repurposing."

In this work, a privacy-preserving semantic communication framework is proposed to protect sensitive content of the image data. Leveraging a vision-language model (VLM), the proposed framework identifies and removes private-content regions from input images prior to transmission. A shared privacy database enables semantic alignment between the transmitter and receiver to ensure consistent identification of sensitive entities. At the receiver, a generative module reconstructs the masked regions using learned semantic priors and conditioned on the received text embedding. Simulation results show that generalizes well to unseen image processing tasks, improves reconstruction quality at the authorized receiver by over 10% using text embedding, and reduces identity leakage to the eavesdropper by more than 50%."

    "abstract": "Recently, the significance of Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) has grown beyond mere defense in cyber military operations. The U.S. Field Manual defines CSA as the timely and accurate understanding of friendly and enemy forces, as well as ongoing activities across the battlefield. In line with this, there is a growing demand for capabilities that can analyze and predict attacker behavior in real time. Reflecting this trend, the focus is shifting from traditional Cyber Threat Intelligence to Predictive Threat Intelligence. However, most existing research has concentrated on analyzing and visualizing past attacks, with limited success in forecasting future threats. To address this gap, we propose a Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) prediction mechanism based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Through experimentation with various GNN models, we found that the GraphConv model delivered the best performance. Specifically, GraphConv outperformed the GCN model by 9.51% in Recall and 8.73% in Macro F1-score. These results highlight the potential for preemptively detecting future cyber attacks and lay the groundwork for minimizing security threats."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Despite the security enhancements that 3GPP has added to 5G New Radio (NR), several Physical-layer functions remain vulnerable, including channel state information (CSI) reports. CSI estimation plays a crucial role in scheduling downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) resources. In 5G NR, the base station (gNB) relies on UL CSI reports to optimally allocate resources for DL data transmissions. In this paper, we identify vulnerabilities in CSI reporting that affect communication integrity and confidentiality. We then introduce an attack model where an adversary exploits these vulnerabilities by transmitting a deceptive signal that tampers with the rank indicator (RI) field in the CSI reports. This sophisticated attack bypasses integrity validation and deceives the gNB. We determine the set of subcarriers that the attacker should target to manipulate the 2-bit or 3-bit RI field of a UL CSI report over the air. Using the MATLAB 5G Toolbox, we model the attack and analyze its impact on system performance. Our analysis demonstrates that the attack is effective at signal-to-tampering ratios (STR) of up to 3.69 dB and 5.6 dB for the 2-bit and 3-bit RI fields, respectively. The attack reduces average DL throughput by approximately 50% to 100% for the 2-bit RI case and 35% to 55% for the 3-bit RI case. The impact is most severe when the RI value is maliciously increased, often causing a complete collapse of DL throughput."

    "abstract": "In the face of rapidly developing urban cities, the traditional static traffic signal systems operate on fixed timers, which fall short in adapting to real-time signal management, as some lanes experience high vehicle density while others experience low density. This results in delay in reaching destinations, consuming excessive fuel, which causes pollution and stress-related health issues. This research introduces a real-time integrated adaptive traffic signal control system and signal violation monitoring. The system leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection for vehicle detection and counts vehicles in each lane to assess traffic density to dynamically adjust signal timings. The system supports emergency vehicle detection, such as ambulance and fire trucks, to prioritize lane traffic signals accordingly. The lane in which emergency vehicle is detected will get an immediate green light. Additionally, time-stamped visual evidence of traffic signal violations is saved in the GUI dashboard for enforcement. Built using Python, OpenCV, ByteTrack, and YOLOv11, this system offers a cost-effective, scalable solution for smart city traffic signals which can result in an 18% increase in traffic flow and 22% reduction in vehicle wait time near signal intersections after deployment."

    "abstract": "The growing decentralization of the databases of various hospitals and clinics poses enormous obstacles in the centralized treatment of patients and big-data health insights. In this study, an enhanced middleware framework based on AI is suggested in order to integrate heterogeneous healthcare systems securely and maintain privacy in a healthcare setting. The middleware is a smart translator that can support interoperability between incompatible Electronic Health Record (EHR) formats and standards without data, making it centralized. The data harmonization, anomaly detection, and secure data exchange by encryption and access control mechanisms are implemented by advanced machine learning algorithms embedded into the system. The suggested Support Vector Machine (SVM) system can be scaled, and including new healthcare institutions into it can be carried out with minimum setup work. Experimental analysis proves that the framework is effective in providing reduced complexity in integrating data, enhancing consistency and easy data, and efficient time in multi-institutional collaboration work. This would enable healthcare providers to deliver more data-driven care in a more coordinated fashion and allow safe large-scale medical research, which would, in turn, help improve the healthcare delivery process and patient outcomes without breaking data privacy laws."

Early and accurate diagnosis remains essential to enhance patient results while following quality healthcare standards and decreasing mortality numbers. The current diagnostic approach for ALL assessment depends on expert-investigator evaluation of peripheral blood smear (PBS) images through manual microscopic analysis despite experiencing time-intensive and subjectively variable examination methods. Research development focuses on creating an automatic diagnosis system which classifies PBS images into Benign, Pre, Pro, and Early types needed for proper leukemia treatment management. The study adopted the EfficientNetB0 as their deep learning model as it offered a better performance compared to other deep learning models, and evidence based was that it is computationally effective as well. This study two 3,256 annotated PBS images of which 2,604 were to be used as training and 652 to be used as testing. The test accuracy in the model attained success; 94% demonstrating potential of the model in the diagnostics medical tools. Our strategy facilitates realism in terms of good health and well-being gains and catalyzes the invention of digital diagnostics and consolidates so as to encapsulate sustainable medical technologies during industry-academic collaborations.

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) has created a pressing demand for efficient, renewable, and intelligent charging systems. Conventional solar charging systems often utilize fixed-step Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithms, which suffer from slow convergence, oscillations around the maximum power point (MPP), and poor adaptability under fluctuating irradiance conditions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel embedded C-based adaptive MPPT controller integrated with a Boost converter for solar-powered EV charging applications. The proposed approach employs a real-time C-coded P&O algorithm capable of dynamically tuning the converter’s duty cycle to extract maximum power from the photovoltaic (PV) array while ensuring stable and ripple-free battery charging. The system was designed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, with the embedded code integrated for microcontroller deployment. The PV array delivers a maximum output power of 4379 W, corresponding to a PV voltage of 335.9 V and current of –13.05 A, while maintaining a battery charging voltage of 335.9 V and 90.04% state of charge (SoC). The proposed controller achieved an MPPT efficiency of 97%, converter efficiency of 96%, and reduced the current ripple by 33% with a 31% faster settling time compared to the conventional fixed-step P&O method. These results confirm that the embedded C-coded control strategy provides higher precision, faster dynamic response, and real-time hardware adaptability, offering a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation renewable energy–driven EV charging infrastructures."

    "abstract": "In mission-critical military operations, maintaining reliable wireless communication is essential, particularly in non-line-of-sight (nLOS) environments caused by terrain obstructions such as hills, buildings, or mountains. These conditions signif-icantly degrade channel performance and pose challenges to coordination and situational awareness. This work presents a machine learning-based framework to predict bit error rate (BER) in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks using physical layer measurements collected from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone user equipment (UE). The study focuses on nLOS conditions representative of tactical deployment scenarios. We utilize features including channel quality indicator (CQI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), modulation and coding scheme (MCS), resource block (RB), and power headroom report (PHR), obtained through controlled LTE experiments conducted in an indoor lab environment and emulating nLOS conditions. Multiple regression models, including Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression, are trained and evaluated for BER prediction accuracy. Results show that BER can be effectively inferred from these observable metrics, enabling real-time channel quality assessment without requiring access to full channel state information (CSI). This approach enhances the adaptability and resilience of communication systems in obstructed radio environments using only smartphone UEs."

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often depend on static, signature-based approaches that fail to recognize emerging zero-day attacks and polymorphic threats. This research presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Autonomous Cyber Defence System capable of detecting, classifying, and mitigating network threats in dynamic environments. The system employs an innovative ensemble of dataset-specific Random Forest (RF) classifiers trained on heterogeneous benchmark datasets: CI-CIDS2017, CICIDS2018, and UNSW-NB15. Predictions from these specialized models are aggregated using a majority-voting mechanism, significantly enhancing both detection accuracy and generalization. For fine-grained threat identification, a Decision Tree classifier trained on the IoT-23 dataset performs multi-class attack classification on anomalies flagged by the ensemble. Experiments demonstrate that the ensemble model achieves over 99.9 percentage detection accuracy. Furthermore, the integration of honeypot-generated data from the Cowrie honeypot enriches the system with realistic attack patterns, creating a robust and adaptive defence mechanism against modern cyber threats."

A digital-twin (DT) enabled dual-timescale framework is proposed that unifies upper-level optimal power flow (OPF) scheduling and lower-level model predictive control (MPC) via scenario-driven deduction in a bilevel formulation. Validated on an oil-and-gas well-station MG, the strategy issues consistent pre- and post-event process commands and preserves steady-state optimality. Relative to a second-order cone programming (SOCP) based OPF baseline, average AC frequency deviation and DC bus voltage deviation during islanding are reduced by 74.1% and 49.6%, respectively. Against two state-of-the-art methods, the tracking consistency between dispatched commands and measured transients improves by 23.8% and 31%. Computation for transient sequences completes within 6–10 s across scenarios, supporting real-time deduction on commodity hardware."

Although significant research has been conducted on the integration of control and communication, existing studies on communication for control systems predominantly emphasize control aspects and warrant further exploration. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on the impacts of topology changes on control systems. This article aims to establish a connection between control and communication via communication topology, examining how communication topologies affect controllers. This article also analyzes the relationship between communication and control in depth. For static topologies, specific controller forms are derived from a general controller to illustrate the impacts of static topologies on controllers. In dynamic topologies, communication is nondeterministic, so whether a controller can receive data from other nodes is nondeterministic. Therefore, controller forms in which some coefficients are random variables following a probability distribution are derived. We utilize them to establish a close connection between control and communication. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted to investigate the impact of different topologies on the control system."

To address these issues, we propose SCAFNet, a Semantic Compensated Adaptive Fusion Network, featuring three core components: 1) The Semantic Compensation Module (SCM) that aligns local-global features via cross-attention to resolve spatial-semantic mismatches; 2) The CNN-Transformer Feature Adaptive Fusion (CTFAF) module improving feature integration by dynamically balancing the local details of CNN and the global context of Transformer through cross-branch attention interactions and dynamic parameterization; 3) The Change Feature Identification Module (CFIM) computing channel and spatial weights, enhancing true changes while suppressing disturbances such as seasonal variations. Experiments on CDD and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate SCAFNet’s superior robustness and accuracy, outperforming existing methods through effective feature fusion.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fully integrated ultra-lowpower $2 \\times / 4 \\times$ reconfigurable charge pump (CP) for RF energy harvesting system to enable switching of the number of operating CP stages at different input levels. The reconfiguration is achieved by an intermediate node voltage detection circuit, which enables timely switching of the switching control signals with fairly low power consumption. Moreover, this CP employs dynamic body bias (DBB) technique to improve driving ability as well as settling time. The output is regulated by a low dropout regulator (LDO) to obtain a ripple-free and stable output voltage without significantly affecting efficiency and power consumption. The design was simulated in a $65-\\mathrm{nm}$ low-power CMOS process and the layout occupies an area of $0.25 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.

    "abstract": "In modern chip design, the placement of millions of circuit modules poses a significant challenge. However, macro placement can significantly enhance this process by enabling greater modularization of the chip design. In many cases, macros can occupy more than half of the die area, making their placement a critical factor in defining the die’s overall shape. Despite its importance, existing algorithms often either neglect this aspect or fail to address it adequately. This paper presents a novel macro placer that enhances reinforcement learning architectures to produce compact and shape-optimized placements. Our research demonstrates that strategically decoupling standard cells during macro placement can significantly reduce network complexity, enabling an efficient relinking solution. Additionally, we introduce a shape force mask into the reinforcement learning-based visual representation learning framework. The approach proposed in this paper enables the creation of compact and shape-optimized chip designs. Experimental results validate that our algorithm can produce more compact and regular macro placements while consistently maintaining other key performance metrics."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of the MQTT protocol for covert channel communication, focusing on both storage-based and timing-based methods. While such channels have been previously studied, our work distinguishes itself by demonstrating their practical feasibility using publicly accessible MQTT brokers as intermediaries. In our setup, endpoints communicate covertly through these public brokers without requiring any modification or influence over the broker itself. This approach enables covert data exfiltration or unauthorized command injection between clients while blending into legitimate MQTT traffic. We validated our implementation using six available public brokers and achieved reliable covert communication through both storage and timing channels. The use of public brokers introduces several critical implications: endpoints can bypass network-level filtering or firewall restrictions, evade detection by security monitoring systems due to the use of legitimate and commonly trusted infrastructure, and potentially scale covert operations across multiple distributed receivers. These findings underline the security risks inherent in permissively configured or widely trusted MQTT infrastructure, and they highlight the need for more strict broker policies and network-level anomaly detection to mitigate covert misuse."

The model is based on multi-input system that includes photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind power, and electric vehicle battery storage with SEPIC and buck-boost topologies. The analysis of the critical time-domain parameters such as rise time (Tr), peak time (Tp), settling time (Ts), and steady-state error (Ess) of both the voltage and current responses are analysed. It has been experimentally shown that FLC based control systems have much better transient performance with a 87 percent reduction in rise time (0.07s vs 0.53s), 85 percent reduction in peak time (0.09s vs 0.62s) and 91 percent reduction in settling time (0.10s vs 1.13s) than PI controllers. The steady-state error was decreasing 89 percent (0.15V vs 1.38 V) in voltage regulation. Using the current control characteristics, similar performance improvements were also found, which makes FLC a more effective control strategy in complex multi-source energy management systems used in modern smart grids. Such innovations as real-time controller adaptation depending on the size of errors, ML-based energy demand prediction with 92.3 percent accuracy, and advanced battery management with state-of-charge awareness are the key ones. It focuses on improving energy efficiency while fostering innovation in sustainable energy technologies. End-to-end simulation outcomes show that there are great improvements in performance and can be highly applicable in the contemporary smart grid infrastructure that needs strong, efficient, and adaptive energy management features."

In this work, we show that in digital sparse arrays, this results in false detection of targets in direction finding applications. As a solution to this problem, we propose sparse digital arrays where the element locations are determined by shifted low discrepancy sequences. We present numerical results and show that the field of view of sparse digital arrays can be extended significantly by using our proposed approach."

To address this, we propose a lightweight, temporally-aware container anomaly detection system based on the Temporal Graph Attention Network (TGAT), validated on a realistic dataset collected from an actual container environment. Experimental results demonstrate our TGAT model achieves significantly higher accuracy than baseline models: outperforming GIN by 2.96% in system anomaly detection and GraphSAGE by 19.79% in network anomaly detection. Compared to a variant without temporal encoding (TGAT w/o), our model also shows improvements of 1.18% and 34.04%, respectively.

Deepfakes use AI to manipulate content, making it appear real. Since Deepfake Technology is updating rapidly, it has become very difficult to identify such fake content. Different methods have been discovered to detect such contents. This paper projects the recent advances and ethical challenges in detecting manipulated content. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advances in deepfake detection methods, alongside an analysis of their broader societal implications. The study examines state-of-the-art detection approaches, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent and transformer-based architectures, multimodal fusion techniques, and frequency-domain and physiological signal–based analyses. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of detection systems from handcrafted feature extraction to end-to-end learning frameworks capable of identifying subtle spatial–temporal inconsistencies and cross-modal discrepancies. Additionally, the paper highlights emerging challenges such as adversarial attacks, dataset bias, generalization across unseen manipulation techniques, and real-time detection constraints. Beyond technical considerations, this work explores the societal impact of deepfakes, including their role in misinformation campaigns, political manipulation, financial fraud, and erosion of public trust in digital media. Legal, ethical, and policy-related responses are discussed, with attention to regulatory frameworks, digital watermarking, and public awareness initiatives aimed at mitigating misuse. By bridging technical advancements with societal perspectives, this paper underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders."

Devices like temperature, dissolved gas, vibration, current and line sag sensors are placed on transformers, distribution lines to detect early fault indicators.

The system had 95.2 % fault prediction, 96 % packet delivery and 220 ms average communication latency. Overheating and insulation degradation in T4, T7 and T9 were correctly detected on the basis of dissolved gas analysis and temperature monitoring. L3, L4, L7 and L9 grid overload conditions were identified with 93% accuracy. The secure cloud interface provides real-time visualization and alerts, as well as role-based access to utility operators and maintenance teams. In general, the presented system positively improves reliability, situational awareness, and diagnostic speed in power distribution networks. It combines edge intelligence, NB-IoT connectivity, and AI-based analytics to reduce or eliminate unplanned outages, decrease maintenance costs, and allow condition-based monitoring.

This study introduces HybridSYN, a hybrid RL framework combining optimization algorithms from AIG and Majority-Inverter Graphs (MIG) to address the limitations of synthesis methods relying on a single logic graph representation. By expanding the action space, HybridSYN enables the exploration of better LUT-level solutions. To improve state representation, HybridSYN processes topological features from both AIG and MIG using independent Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoders. The resulting features are fused and passed through a fully connected network, where the final layer jointly predicts the type of operator and its parameters.

    "abstract": "This paper describes how fifth-generation (5G) New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) multi-hop UE-to-UE (U2U) relays can extend communication range in off-network scenarios, where UE denotes User Equipment. We focus on key challenges introduced by SL’s distributed resource allocation (Mode 2) in multi-hop topologies, particularly when semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) is used. We use system-level simulations to evaluate a tactical scenario with mission-critical push-to-talk (MCPTT) traffic over a multi-hop U2U topology. Our results show how compounded intra-path interference and losses due to half-duplex operation can degrade end-to-end communication performance. We further identify specific scheduling configuration settings that influence these effects and impact the attainable communication range."

    "abstract": "Wheat is an important crop worldwide, but foliar diseases like Brown Rust, Loose Smut, Septoria and Yellow Rust heavily affect the yield of this crop. Conventional ways of detecting diseases are based on manual observation, which can be quite laborious, prone to error, and inapplicable to large scale farming. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a fine-tuned VGG16 network to classify wheat leaf disease automatically. This dataset was obtained on the open-source Kaggle platform and includes 5,597 images which are divided into 5 classes: Brown Rust, Healthy, Loose Smut, Septoria, and Yellow Rust. Transfer learning was then used to fine-tune the VGG16 model with ImageNet weights and further classifier layers were incorporated to improve the classification efficiency. The model was tested on an experimental basis with results showing an overall accuracy of 96% in the correct classification of visually similar classes of disease. The suggested solution emphasizes the possibilities of deep learning in monitoring and detecting diseases in real-time, scaled, and reliable to aid farmers in managing crops sustainably and promote precision agriculture."

A parallel corpus of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 2 0}$</tex> news articles (60 human-written and 60 AI-generated) was created, and lexical patterns were examined using lexical clustering keyword analysis. Subsequently, the present study employed social actor framework to investigate the representation of immigrant women. Findings reveal that human journalists predominantly frame immigrant women through personal narratives and social integration themes, emphasizing individual lived experiences and emotional dimensions, whereas AI texts focus on policy analysis and institutional critique while to some degree lacking contextual depth and humanistic concern. Further, though both text types construct immigrant women as passive victims, AI texts amplify this through highfrequency terms like “violence” and “detained”. Regarding identity representation, human news uses multiple labels (e.g., geography, ethnicity, economic status) to intersect the composite identities of immigrant women, whereas AI texts rely on the abstract “immigrant” label, showing significant “decontextualization” characteristics. The study demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) are yet capable of addressing societal issues like immigration, probably due to limitations in training data and safety mechanisms. We argue for a safe and equitable treatment of minoritized communities in LLM design and training."

    "abstract": "The fast growth of Android devices and applications has turned the platform into an appealing target for cybercriminals, leading to a tremendous increase in Android malware. Given that traditional signature-based detection techniques can no longer keep pace with rapidly evolving threats, advanced detection techniques based on Deep Learning (DL) have emerged as effective alternatives. Hence, an effective technique named Deep Residual Network with Mean Baikal loss (DRN-MB) is developed for malware detection in Android devices. At first, the Android device model is considered, and the feature extraction process is executed based on the statically extracted information, dynamically observed behaviors, and PCAP of the network traffic. Next, feature selection is performed by using a Random Forest classifier. The selected features are further subjected to the malware detection process. Here, malware detection is done by the novel DRN-MB, which is developed by modifying the loss function of the Deep Residual Network (DRN) using the Mean Baikal (MB) loss. The MB-loss function is devised by integrating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) with the Baikal loss. Moreover, the DRN-MB method achieved an accuracy of 96.588%, a recall of 97.279%, and a precision of 96.357% by utilizing the Android malware dataset with the k-value 8."

    "abstract": "The open radio access network (O-RAN) enables modular, intelligent, and programmable 5G network architectures through the adoption of software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and implementation of standardized open interfaces. It also facilitates closed-loop control and (non/near) real-time optimization of radio access network (RAN) through the integration of non-real-time applications (rApps) and near-real-time applications (xApps). However, one of the security concerns for O-RAN that can severely undermine network performance and subject it to a prominent threat to the security & reliability of O-RAN networks is jamming attacks. To address this, we introduce SAJD – a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML)-integrated O-RAN environments. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming interference via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps. Specifically, a labeler rApp is developed that uses live telemetry (i.e., KPIs) to detect model drift, triggers unsupervised data labeling, executes model training/retraining using the integrated & open-source ClearML framework, and updates deployed models on the fly, without service disruption. Experiments on O-RAN-compliant testbed demonstrate that the SAJD framework outperforms state-of-the-art (offline-trained with manual labels) jamming detection approach in accuracy and adaptability under various dynamic and previously unseen interference scenarios."

By Integrating a Fingerprint sensor with a microcontroller, the proposed model ensures that only authorized students gain access, reducing errors and impersonation risks. The system stores fingerprint data in a database and matches it in real time during Verification. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and speed, making it suitable for large-scale academic environments. This innovation enhances examination security and simplifies administrative procedures. In many educational institutions, manual hall ticket checking during examinations is time-consuming and vulnerable to mistakes or impersonation. This paper presents a smart exam hall authentication system designed to address these issues using fingerprint-based verification. The system combines a fingerprint sensor, microcontroller, and real-time database matching to confirm student identity before permitting entry. When a student scans their finger, the system quickly retrieves and verifies their biometric record, ensuring seamless and secure access. The proposed system highlights the system’s efficiency, accuracy, and suitability for large academic settings.

    "abstract": "Routing is a crucial part of analog integrated circuit design. For inter-block routing in analog circuit layouts, existing routing algorithms fail to achieve full connectivity across all scenarios while minimizing track usage, ultimately leading to wasted chip area and increased production costs. This paper proposes a post-routing optimization algorithm for inter-block routing regions in analog circuit layouts. The post-routing optimization algorithm enhances track utilization by reusing tracks in channel routing regions and applying single-layer rerouting in single-sided pin regions, reducing amount of track. In channel routing regions without wire-ordering constraints, track usage, area occupation, and wire length are reduced by $23.37 \\%, 25.05 \\%$, and 17.83%, respectively. For single-sided pin regions, these parameters are reduced by with $49 \\%, 49.34 \\%$ and 4.77%. The algorithm is further extended to address specific global layout optimization. Through the integration of intraregion optimization and wire-ordering constraints, 8 tracks are reduced with an area saving of $377.66 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The research provides a practical solution for area-efficient analog integrated circuit design with significant cost-reduction implications."

This paper presents a novel cloud-native BI framework that integrates federated query processing, reinforcement learning-based adaptive data pipeline orchestration, and serverless GPU-accelerated analytics to address scalability, latency, and cost challenges inherent in modern data ecosystems. The framework executes analytics directly on distributed datasets across Azure and Google Cloud Platform, eliminating data migration overhead and preserving data locality. An RL-driven orchestrator dynamically optimizes ETL/ELT workflows for variable workloads, while serverless GPU instances accelerate complex predictive analytics tasks. Columnar storage combined with semantic vector indexing further enhances real-time query performance. Additionally, the framework incorporates event-driven CQRS architecture for low-latency dashboard updates, streaming feature stores for inline AI insights, and differential privacy mechanisms to ensure compliance without compromising data utility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that federated query processing reduces average latency by 52%, while RL-based orchestration improves throughput by 7 queries per second and cuts latency by 35%. GPU acceleration halves query execution time for compute-intensive workloads. Semantic indexing reduces retrieval time by over 50%, and differential privacy preserves compliance with minimal accuracy loss (<0.4%). Overall, the framework achieves over 99.4% accuracy in analytics results across all modules, proving its effectiveness in enabling scalable, secure, and cost-efficient real-time BI across multi-cloud platforms."

We propose a novel learning-aided approach that integrates the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty (LDPP) framework and Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) reinforcement learning algorithms. This offers a powerful approach to learning stable and constraint-aware policies, reaping the joint benefits of both LDPP and MADDPG in complex multi-agent environments. The main challenge lies in integrating these two approaches effectively. The key idea to solve this problem is to introduce a novel feature of local observation that incorporates potential negative value of the reward function due to the stochastic constraints introduced by the LDPP framework. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods under various conditions."

In this work, we consider a distributed transmit array where each transmitter is on a separate platform and geographically sparse. For practical distributed array systems, the achievable beamforming gain is degraded by both error in the channel estimates and the distributed geometry of the transmit nodes. We derive a performance guarantee on transmit beamforming gain for scenarios where individual transmit nodes can coordinate to send common data to a multi-antenna receiver. This guarantee is expressed in terms of a system figure-of-merit called the error-gap ratio, which incorporates both the impacts of channel estimation error and geometry."

The objective is to integrate the ml and dl models to those passpoints and analyse the features like user behaviour, number of clicks,number of attempts ,time taken to select the passpoints for authentication. In this document, machine learning classifiers random forest and support vector machine have taken but comparing with ML classifiers, DL model lstm(long-short term memory) model works better and ensures more security by understanding complex passwords. Calculation is done for the performance metrics like accuracy(Acc), precision(pre),recall(rec) and f1-score of all the ML and DL models. From experimental work, the observation is, DL outperforms than the ML classifiers. From experimental observation, this revealed that the lstm model performs well and provides absolute security and obtained the performance acc,pre,rec,f1-score. Accuracy is 97.75% and precision is (1.0000),recall(0.98),f1-score(0.9631). From experimental work, the random classifier has the accuracy 90.76% and support vector machine has the accuracy of 89.09%. The study demonstrate that LSTM works poorful for long term passwords and detects the real user. Results show the proposed approach increases password entropy and resists common observation attacks while maintaining quicker recall than complex text passwords.

    "abstract": "Public ceremonies, such as events, classes, places of worship, or exhibitions, often include a high concentration of people in limited indoor places. In such an environment, health issues, imbalances or conflicts increases the risk of accidental human fall. Traditional monitoring and manual monitoring systems fail to immediately detect or provide an alert for such important events, leading to delayed reactions that can spoil the results of the injury or even cause congestion nervousness. Addressing this challenge, our project proposes a real-time software solution that takes advantage of AI and Computer Vision to detect human falls and immediately informs security personnel or carers for timely intervention. The system uses a live video feed from existing CCTV or IP cameras and applies advanced deep learning models such as YOLOv 8 for human identity jointly with pose assessment framework to track body movement. When the sudden loss of posture or horizontal decline is detected, the system sends an automated alert through integrated services such as firebase cloud messaging or Twilio SMS API. Alerts can be configured to access mobile devices, web dashboards or alerting systems in real time, which ensures rapid response from on-ground personnel. Major features of the proposed system include monitoring non-grace (no need for wearable equipment), compatibility with existing infrastructure, scalability and congestion settings at many places include high accuracy (tests with 40–50 individuals per room). The modular architecture of the system includes video stream handling, fall detection engine, alert module and monitoring interfaces for logging and visualization. This solution increases safety in public places by reducing dependence on manual observation and enabling early emergency response. The project shows how artificial intelligence can be applied for social good by improving mob safety and real-time phenomenon. Future work can focus on external landscapes, obstacles handling and multi-camera integration to further improve reliability and coverage."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework for optimizing and analyzing LEO satellite constellations through the joint design of orbital parameters and payload configuration (i.e space segment antenna) to maximize system downlink capacity. The approach integrates constellation geometry with antenna allocation per satellite, using sum-capacity in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenarios. To address the computational cost of evaluating each candidate design, Bayesian Optimization is employed as a sample-efficient black-box search method. Simulation results demonstrate that highlight the value of combining accurate capacity modeling with integrated constellation and hardware co-design."

    "abstract": "The paper proposes a quantum-classical hybrid method of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to combine quantum inspired computation on WSD with classical natural language processing methods. The quantum state encoding is proposed to make ambiguous words coded in the framework as quantum superposition of all the possible senses, and semantic interpretations can be explored by encoding quantum states. A simulation of quantum circuits based on simulated quantum interactions was used to create a hybrid model involving variational quantum circuits and classical neural layer using the PyTorch platform. The system was trained and tested on a manually annotated collection of 5,000 polysemous sentences spanning various domains and tested on WordNet synsets. The experimental findings reveal that the hybrid quantum-classical model of WSD has 94.7 per cent accuracy and weighted F1-score of 94.0 per cent, which is better than CNN-LSTM and Transformer (BERT-base) baselines. The confusion matrix affirms enhanced sense differentiation and less semantic duplicity. The suggested architecture illustrates the possibility of quantum-enhanced natural language processing to be used in order to reach a higher contextual accuracy without compromising the computational efficiency that would be suitable with near-term quantum hardware."

The current method Automated Resume Parsers (ARPs) that use keyword matching to assess the claimed skills of the candidate. This creates a gap between qualifications and actual abilities, more specifically in terms of projects, code quality, etc. The current approach doesn’t check if the candidate actually used their skills, can’t find copied work, and doesn’t access the progress over time. Tool like CVExplorer and SkillsMap try to use GitHub data and evaluate the candidate’s skills, but they don’t support many languages, they’re not very accurate, can’t access the quality of their work. The GitMeter system, which was introduced in this paper, is a better option because it uses a smart analysis method to determine both hard and soft skills from publicly available projects on their GitHub. But it still has some issues: it only looks at public GitHub activity, works with just Python and Java, can’t catch copied or AI-generated code, and doesn’t assess important soft skills like teamwork or empathy.To fix these problems, our improved system adds support for more languages using tools like CodeQL, checks if code is original with the help of AI models and plagiarism tools,and academic profiles to build a more complete and reliable way to hire."

    "abstract": "Web analytics platforms face growing challenges in manual tagging inefficiencies, schema drift, and regulatory compliance. This paper presents a privacy-first, AI-driven architecture that integrates privacy-preserving data collection with automated schema governance and adaptive compliance enforcement. On the client side, a lightweight JavaScript SDK validates event payloads against strict JSON Schemas, masks sensitive fields, and enforces user choices via Global Privacy Control (GPC) and consent management platforms (e.g., One Trust). On the server side, a policy-as-code framework applies regional and purpose-specific rules, ensuring no event is transmitted without explicit consent. The architecture incorporates three AI-based modules: Auto-Schema Agent – Generates and maintains event specifications dynamically. Drift & Anomaly Detector – Identifies schema inconsistencies and shifts in data distribution. Policy Recommender – Suggests updates to deny-lists as new fields emerge. Methods: Synthetic evaluations were performed using simulated event streams with schema mutations, consent toggles, and anomaly injection. Performance was measured against baseline manual schema governance and static policy enforcement. Results: Findings indicate that schema governance effort is reduced by ~70%, setup time shortened by 75%, and schema drift detection accelerated from multiple days to hours. Consent-aware policy enforcement achieved 100% compliance in simulated GPC and regional policy scenarios. This work contributes a deployable reference architecture, an AI-assisted schema governance model, and a policy evaluation framework for next-generation, compliance-ready web analytics systems."

    "abstract": "Microservice architectures, while scalable, often harbor intricate execution dependencies forming critical performance bottlenecks. These vulnerabilities are exploited by sophisticated low-rate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that cause severe operational disruptions yet evade conventional detection due to their subtlety, posing significant risks to critical infrastructure and systems that demand high operational assurance, including those in national security contexts. Orchestrating stealthy, high-impact attacks against these opaque dependencies is a considerable challenge. This paper introduces PhantomRift, a novel framework that enhances attack stealth and efficacy by integrating LLM-assisted semantic path discovery for comprehensive surface mapping—uncovering elusive, dynamically triggered paths—with deep quantitative modeling of inter-path dependency strengths and complex relational typologies. Experimentally, PhantomRift’s optimized strategies achieve substantial performance degradation (e.g., a 12-fold increase in average response time, with approximately 35% less request traffic than the baselines), while its efficiency and precise, sub-detection-threshold millisecond-level bottleneck control ensure enhanced stealth via a minimized operational footprint. This research highlights the transformative potential of Large Language Models in automating sophisticated network attacks. It underscores the urgent security challenges faced by contemporary systems, particularly those underpinning strategic capabilities in contested digital environments."

    "abstract": "Retina diseases like diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and glaucoma are some of the most significant causes of visual impairments and blindness in most parts of the world especially where there exists a lack of ophthalmic experts. Conventional techniques of detection such as manual examination of the fundus, optical coherence tomography and slit-lamp examination are effective, but they are labor intensive, time consuming and lacking inter-observer consistency. New developments in artificial intelligence, especially, deep learning, have shown to be transformative in automated retinal disease classification. In this paper, the proposed model is a multi-class convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model to classify retinal images into normal, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and glaucoma. The preprocessing and augmentation of a curated dataset of images of various public sources were done to enhance the model robustness. The CNN-fine-tuned model had an average accuracy of 97% and high precision, recall and F1-scores in all the categories with limited misclassifications in the confusion matrix. The results outline the possibilities of deep learning models to become scalable diagnostic tools, which would be helpful to conduct early disease diagnostics and perform effective screening of diseases in clinics and communities. This paper helps advance the adoption of AI-based systems in ophthalmology by providing a framework that is both accurate, generalized, and clinical in practice."

The proposed design has been applied to the board-based PYNQ-Z2 focusing on parallel processing using Verilog HDL to achieve high-speed operation with low latency. The essence of innovation in this study is combining Sobel-based edge detection with real-time pixel enhancement at the level of FPGA hardware to enable diagnostically relevant images with low computational overhead. The system proposed here produces enhanced grayscale X-ray images to be displayed externally and hence is applicable to portable diagnostic medical applications. The aim is to achieve resource optimization with low costs and real-time support toward imaging in healthcare facilities where immediate and accurate preprocessing is required."

    "abstract": "The disaggregation of 5G networks, particularly through the introduction of the Open RAN Intelligent Controller (O-RAN RIC), creates new opportunities for fine-grained network control but also introduces novel attack surfaces. Malicious actors can exploit this architecture to launch sophisticated Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, such as throttling the throughput of specific User Equipment (UE), which can be difficult to detect with traditional security methods, and also lack the potential for mitigation. This paper introduces an intelligent, two-part framework for automated anomaly detection and mitigation, operating as xApps at the Near-Real-Time RIC (Near-RT RIC). We design an Intrusion Detection xApp (ID xApp) that leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Autoencoder to analyze temporal UE behavior based on collected Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and identify anomalous patterns characteristic of a DoS attack. Upon detection, the ID xApp triggers a Secure Slicing xApp (SSxApp), which automatically isolates the malicious UE by moving it to a secure network slice with no allocated resources, effectively neutralizing the threat without impacting other users. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately detecting and autonomously mitigating DoS attacks, presenting a robust AI-driven security solution for next-generation cellular networks."

The performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated in terms of range and velocity estimation accuracy and is compared against the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the bi-static ISAC setting. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves estimation performance that closely approaches the CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime."

    "abstract": "We examine a simplified coherent distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB) link consisting of two transmitters sending a single data stream to a receiver. The novel elements introduced are a method for computing expected link throughput and an analysis of performance when operating over wireless channels with significant time-varying phase distortion. To offset the channel phase distortion, each transmitter samples the state of its channel using a periodic sounding waveform sent by the receiver. As the age of the last sampled channel state increases, so does the probability of phase error between the beamforming components. A quantized phase space model is introduced for the wireless channel and the DCB gain performance is analyzed with respect to age of channel state information (AoCSI). Additionally, we introduce a framework for computing expected throughput of the DCB link, whereby the channel sensing period is optimized to the wireless channel conditions. Future network planning for WSNs or MANETs can use this framework for incorporating DCB links. Adding DCB links to a wireless network does not necessarily require additional hardware and provides benefits such as greater link ranges, increased throughput, reduced transmit power, and reduced interference."

The interconnected influences result in challenging coupled dynamics within the group of agents. Motivated by this challenge, robust control techniques are used to compensate for the complex chain of influences among the group, and a Lyapunov-based analysis is used to prove the target is exponentially regulated to a desired location by the herding agent."

    "abstract": "As conventional three-phase two-switch power factor correction (PFC) converters operate at continuous conduction mode, it is difficult to control the intermediate phase current effectively, which leads to distortion of the grid current. A novel three-phase two-switch PFC converter topology based on third harmonic injection is proposed in this paper to realize wide-power-range and low-harmonic operation. The third harmonic is injected through a resonant network to enhance the grid current quality. The impact of harmonic injection amplitude and resonant network parameters on the current quality of grid side is analyzed. The harmonic injection coefficient can be regulated in real time to ensure that the PFC converter meets harmonic requirements in a wide power range. The resonant network parameters are optimally configured according to the constraint condition of current harmonics and operating power, which can avoid the impact of increased neutral point voltage at the DC-link on the stable operation of the converter. Therefore, the harmonic distortion of the grid current can be significantly reduced, and the power factor can be improved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed converter topology is verified on the three-phase two-switch PFC converter prototype. Compared to the traditional method, the efficiency of the PFC converter can be improved by more than 2% while meeting international electrotechnical commission (IEC) 61000-3-2 harmonic standards."

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication is essential in mission-critical settings, including military applications, where persistent and asymmetric link blockages caused by mobility, jamming, or adversarial attacks can disrupt delay-sensitive transmissions. This paper addresses this challenge by deploying a multilevel diversity coding (MDC) scheme that controls the received information, offers distinct reliability guarantees based on the priority of data streams, and maintains low design and operational complexity as the number of network paths increases. For two priority levels over three edge-disjoint paths, the complete capacity region is characterized, showing that superposition coding achieves the region in general, whereas network coding is required only in a specific corner case. Moreover, sufficient conditions under which a simple superposition coding scheme achieves the capacity for an arbitrary number of paths are identified. To prove these results and provide a unified analytical framework, the problem of designing high-performing MDC schemes is shown to be equivalent to the problem of designing high-performing encoding schemes over a class of broadcast networks, referred to as combination networks in the literature."

Moreover, to characterize the statistical data rate of VR services under a given delay constraint, we investigate the effective capacity (EC) of the VR video streaming under HRS-CF strategy. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the precoding matrix, rate splitting coefficients, and BS selection using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, where a power threshold-based BS selection is introduced to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed HRS-CF strategy outperforms the conventional rate splitting and CF transmission schemes, achieving at least a 16% performance improvement."

    "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems is poised to enable a hyper-connected world of intelligent devices, where tiny machine learning (TinyML) will drive pervasive, real-time applications. However, this paradigm, built on distributed data from billions of endpoints, introduces an unprecedented privacy attack surface. A fundamental challenge for deploying AI in 6G is ensuring robust data privacy on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing model utility. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), a cornerstone of private machine learning, critically depends on managing gradient sensitivity, a task traditionally hampered by the manual tuning of a static clipping threshold. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of gradient control mechanisms for DP-SGD, evaluated from a 6G deployment perspective. We trace the evolution from static clipping to fully adaptive scaling methods that obviate the need for a fixed threshold. To unify these approaches, we propose a conceptual framework, culminating in a case study of the Differentially Private Per-sample Adaptive Scaling Clipping (DP-PSASC) algorithm. We argue that such adaptive methods are not merely algorithmic improvements but are essential, “6G-adaptive” solutions that can be integrated into next-generation network architectures, such as the Open RAN (O-RAN) framework, to deliver efficient, scalable, and trustworthy AI."

This article formulates an emergency computation offloading model to guide the collaboration between cloud servers and edge servers to maximize the dispatchable power of VPP. The model identifies analytically the range of attack intensities where a VPP can maintain full dispatchable power and where the VPP cannot. It also uncovers the convexity property of VPP’s dispatchable power. The proposed model is submodular so that an efficient submodular optimization algorithm can be developed to alleviate the curse of dimensionality inherent in the computation offloading problem. Numerical studies were carried out on the VPP with 9,951 DSRs to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A small-scale VPP was also selected to show that the proposed method offers comparable performance, but much less computational cost, to deep reinforcement learning methods."

We propose a low-complexity PO estimator that averages downlink (DL) pilot responses across frequency, then reuses the DL phase to align uplink pilots at the user without extra training. Using only base station-RIS power inferred from DL, we develop a weighted least-squares cascaded-channel estimator. We also quantify PO impact on representative LS-based and two-timescale schemes. Simulations show robust PO compensation, sizable normalized mean square error reductions, and achievable-rate gains with limited pilots."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) into everyday environments has heightened concerns about how personal data is perceived, shared, and protected. While much research on IoT privacy has concentrated on technical safeguards, individuals’ attitudes toward privacy are equally shaped by psychological and linguistic factors. This study investigates how privacy concerns expressed in social media discourse can be predicted by integrating psycholinguistic patterns with personality and risk-related features. We introduce a deep learning framework, BERTweet, that fuses textual representations with auxiliary features derived from the Big Five personality traits and general risk propensity. Our dataset comprises 85,112 tweets (a consensus subset where GPT-4.1, Grok, and DeepSeek all agreed), drawn from five publicly available corpora. Privacy annotations were generated through a multi-step process that began with zero-shot classification and was finalised via majority voting across the three large language models. The proposed fusion architecture dynamically balances contributions from linguistic, personality, and risk dimensions. Evaluation on a held-out test set of 8,512 tweets shows that the BERTweet-Large fusion model achieved 96.8% accuracy, with strong F1 performance for sensitive (low-privacy, high-disclosure) tweets (97.6%) and non-sensitive (high-privacy, low-disclosure) tweets (95.2%). We benchmark this model against BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa backbones under identical training conditions to substantiate the choice of BERTweet for tweet-level privacy prediction. Unlike approaches that rely on explicit metadata or direct tagging, our method reveals the implicit ways privacy concerns emerge in everyday language use. The findings highlight the value of combining psycholinguistic, Big Five, and risk features in deep learning systems, offering a scalable approach to building privacy-aware models that address the complexities of IoT and social media ecosystems. The study therefore contributes a psychologically grounded, empirically validated framework that links tweet-level language, inferred traits, and risk propensity to IoT privacy concern, and provides a transparent benchmark for future privacy-aware language models."

    "abstract": "We propose a unified mathematical meta-framework for long-distance navigation in birds, based on a bundle-theoretic representation of multisensory integration within evolving combinatorial structures. Various information streams–uch as magnetic, celestial, olfactory, and landmark cues–are modeled as typed fibers over a time-varying simplicial base, which is reconstructed from behavioral trajectories and neural co-activity. In this framework, integration is framed as a global consistency problem: coherent system-level representations occur when there are globally compatible assignments across overlapping local contexts. This is equivalent to finding global sections of an evolving bundle. The tension between local and global perspectives is formalized in quantum theory through the concept of contextuality, which expresses the impossibility of a single, non-contextual global assignment that is consistent with all local marginals. In Bell-type scenarios, this aligns with operational non-locality and device-independent signatures of entanglement. We demonstrate that the same constraint semantics provide a precise mathematical connection between canonical contextuality models and biological cue integration, treating contextuality as a calculus for diagnosing and localizing incompatibilities in distributed representations. Our theory introduces two computable topological observables: critical simplices and interface loops. Critical simplices identify discrete remapping pivots where the structural scaffold must be reconfigured to restore consistency, while interface loops detect transient conflict cycles at the boundaries between different information streams. Together, these observables form a diagnostic “compass” that integrates cues onto a common scaffold, localizes incompatible overlaps, and predicts when spatial representations need to be remapped. We validate our framework using standard quantum contextuality scenarios, including Bell’s theorem and KCBS, successfully recovering established contextuality classifications through bundle obstructions and loop signatures. We then apply this framework to an anatomy-aware model of avian navigation, in which entanglement-capable cryptochrome/radical-pair dynamics serve as a microscopic source of non-classical correlations, without assuming that macroscopic entanglement occurs across neural circuits. In this model, microscopic non-classicality influences adaptive functions by leaving persistent, computable contextual footprints within the evolving biological scaffold, providing testable signatures at the level of remapping events and context-dependent cue integration."

Machine learning (ML) has proven to be an effective tool due to its ability to accurately detect complex patterns in network data. Maintaining high model performance, however, is a constant challenge, as malicious actors are non-static and the distribution, frequency and variety of attacks a network experiences constantly changes. Continual Learning (CL) has emerged as a new paradigm for ML-based NIDS to constantly adapt to changing threats and network environments, but faces many key issues, most of all the catastrophic forgetting problem. This paper provides an empirical analysis of different training strategies of CL and model-agnostic metal learning (MAML) to mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting within the network security domain. We show that regularization strategies prove ineffective in network security to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and that replay is the most effective way to ameliorate catastrophic forgetting. We also demonstrate that model repair with MAML, while effective for select classes, causes dramatic performance degradation to other classes. This work should prove useful in future research into the efficacy of traditional continual learning strategies in ML-NIDS, and their potential applications."

Traditional methods for analysis based on visual observation may be slow and sometimes incorrect or inaccurate. Thus, to mitigate these difficulties, this paper presents an AI system for machine-based synthesis of football match analysis using deep learning algorithms. The system utilizes a maximally optimized YOLO model to identify players, referees, and the ball, and OpenCV methods to track, rectify perspective and derive metrics. It can then measure player velocity, total distance travelled, identify ball possession by team and predict potential goal scorers from location data. The architecture also includes visual overlays which benefit coaches and analysts in maximizing game appreciation. Evaluative data confirms the validity of the approach's accuracy in challenging conditions such as occlusion and fast ball flight, providing consistency and scalability for football analysis overall. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves a precision of 95.62%, recall of 73.86%, and an overall accuracy of 83.35% on match footage. This proves that the approach identified key elements of the game with high confidence while sustaining balanced performance in complex scenarios."

Due to competing workloads and the dynamic nature of the edge environment, server availability fluctuates over time. To maintain accurate estimates of server availability states, each dispatcher updates its belief using two mechanisms: (i) active queries over shared communication channels and (ii) feedback from past job executions. We formulate a query scheduling problem that maximizes the job success rate under limited communication resources for queries. This problem is modeled as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) with multiple actions and addressed using a Net-Gain Maximization (NGM) scheduling algorithm, which selects servers to query based on their expected improvement in execution performance. Simulation results show that the proposed NGM Policy significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to a 30% gain over the Round-Robin Policy and up to a 107% gain over the Never-Query Policy."

A major challenge is the dynamic nature of this environment, stemming from unpredictable movements of a large number of users, unanticipated obstacles, and inconsistent terrain, in addition to jamming and other sources of interference. User grouping, or clustering, can be used to increase reliability by partitioning users into manageable subsets to be served by different allocated beams. In this paper, we apply spectral clustering to the distinct challenge of dynamic user grouping for satellite communications within a tactical SAGIN environment. We introduce a novel analysis from the perspective of a dynamic satellite observer as well as new similarity metrics tailored to the SAGIN geometric and kinematic characteristics. Several dynamic cluster count selection techniques, such as REQ and GAP, are analyzed against a traditional K-Means approach. Results show that REQ demonstrated more cluster stability, quality, and computational efficiency via consistent silhouette scores less than 0.1 across time frames and scenarios; 2.5x improvement in cluster assignment persistence over K-Means and more over GAP when altitude and velocity are incorporated; and a much more consistent and predictable runtime at 1/5 K-Means and 1/2 GAP runtimes."

    "abstract": "Wildfire monitoring is increasingly done at the network edge using small, shared (multi-tenant) sensor nodes with cameras and on-device ML. While this architecture scales, it is also susceptible to new reliability and security risks. In this paper we study how co-located workloads and side channels can undermine wildfire detection on a shared GPU edge node.Using real workloads, we show two key effects. First, inference latency is content-dependent: frames that look like fire or smoke tend to trigger heavier model paths and take longer to process. Second, a concurrent ML application (e.g., an animal detector) can slow the wildfire pipeline and cause instability by competing for VRAM and compute. Taken these effects together, timing and simple GPU telemetry (utilization, memory, power) leak enough signal for a co-tenant to infer when \"fire-like\" frames are being processed and to time bursts of activity that further delay or drop those frames.To mitigate this problem, we argue that edge deployments should treat stateful triage as a first-class system component. Rather than emitting isolated detections, a lightweight triage layer maintains short event state, enforces basic spatiotemporal consistency (e.g., smoke before flame, persistent growth), and adapts resource use based on both event state and platform health. This paper contributes: (1) an empirical analysis of multi-tenant risks for wildfire ML at the edge, including content-dependent latency and timing side channels; (2) a security-oriented threat model for shared edge nodes; and (3) a design sketch for stateful triage that can reduce false positives, prioritize likely true events, and blunt denial-of-service and timing leaks."

    "abstract": "Tactical military systems must operate reliably in dynamic environments marked by mobility, intermittent connectivity, and variable data flows. To meet strict Quality of Service/Experience (QoS/E) for mission-critical Command and Control (C2) operations, simulation-based testing offers a cost-effective alternative to live training. A crucial component of these simulations is the mobility model, which directly impacts Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) behavior and performance. Most existing models, however, lack the strategic and hierarchical movement patterns seen in real missions. The Anglova scenario, widely used for its operational relevance, offers a valuable basis for improving realism. This paper presents an in-depth characterization of Anglova Scenario Vignette 2, analyzing spatial-temporal mobility, mission roles, and inter-entity dynamics. These insights support a better understanding of mission dynamics and the development of more accurate tactical mobility models."

    "abstract": "Finding an accurate method for brain tumor detection remains a significant challenge in medical imaging, as many deep learning models struggle to balance segmentation precision with computational efficiency. Existing approaches often achieve high segmentation accuracy but overlook the importance of inference speed and memory requirements, thereby limiting their clinical applicability. To overcome this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines Attention U-Net for tumor segmentation with the Slender Loris Optimization Algorithm (SLOA), a newly designed bio-inspired metaheuristic for hyperparameter tuning and performance optimization. The attention mechanism enhances segmentation by focusing on tumor-relevant regions, while SLOA improves classification accuracy and convergence by effectively exploring the parameter space. A publicly accessible multi-class brain MRI dataset includes glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and normal (no tumor) was used for the research. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 98.6%, outperforming several baseline models, including CNN, U-Net, ResNet, and VGG. The model processes each image in approximately 0.2 seconds, featuring a lightweight architecture that qualifies it for real-time clinical deployment. These findings demonstrate that a reliable and effective method for brain tumour analysis can be achieved by fusing attention-based segmentation with biologically inspired optimisation. To improve generalization across various datasets, future research will extend the framework to other medical imaging modalities, utilizing federated learning and transfer learning."

The dataset used for neural networks are obtained from Sentaurus TCAD. The weight parameters in the MLP model were updated by gradient descent method and the accuracy of the model was evaluated by mean logarithmic squared error function. The final results show that the developed model can effectively predict the effect of WFV on HTFET device performance. Compared with the random grain distribution method used by TCAD, the trained MLP-based NN model can predict the key performance parameters of WFV with more than $300 \\times$ improved speed, and with the predicted Pearson’s coefficient value of 0.927 for threshold voltage. This indicates that the MLP-based NN model has a great potential for HTFET WFV performance optimization and related researches."

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) mitigates sample complexity by decomposing complex objectives into simpler subskills, yet handcrafting these skills and their intrinsic rewards remains expertise-dependent and resource-intensive. We introduce a novel agentic AI framework that harnesses the task decomposition and planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate both skill discovery and reward shaping within HRL. By prompting an LLM to identify semantically meaningful skills and craft corresponding intrinsic reward functions, our method significantly reduces manual engineering effort. We validate our approach in CAGE Challenge 4, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) cybersecurity environment, showing that our LLM-guided hierarchical policy achieves faster convergence and improved performance in cyber defense relative to flat MARL baselines. These results underscore the potential of integrating agentic AI into multi-agent HRL for scalable, interpretable, and efficient cyber-defense."

Cloud Data Verification is a significant difficulty since, although it enables flexibility, it also raises substantial concerns about data quality and security because it operates on decentralised networks over standard Internet protocols. This process have looked into data preparation tactics in large data mining and tried traditional methods like encryption and decryption, however there are still limits. In order to tackle this, they provide a feature extraction approach that combines a hybrid deep learning framework with UFKLDA. The model is designed for Cloud Data Verification and incorporates a RNN for temporal regression and a CNN for spatial feature extraction. The result is a robust hybrid model. This method outperforms several traditional models, according to experimental data, which provide an astounding accuracy of 98.27%. These results highlight the need for cloud security practices to incorporate sophisticated machine learning techniques. Finally, for Cloud Data Verification, the suggested CNN-RNN hybrid model is an excellent and trustworthy option, and it has great promise for improving data integrity in distributed cloud settings."

The effective resistance value of the access resistor in the network is controlled and adjusted by the temperature detection circuit, thereby adjusting the absolute value of the bandgap reference output voltage. The amount of change in the resistance value of the adjustment module is used to compensate for the amount of drift of the reference voltage caused by temperature changes, in order to achieve the purpose of reducing the temperature drift of the output voltage. In this paper, the specific verification of this method is based on the $0.18 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ BCD process. The results show that through the adjustment of this method, the temperature drift coefficient of the bandgap reference can be reduced from $8.394 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $1.997 \\mathrm{ppm} /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, and the adjustment function can be realized."

Chitosan (CS) is a product of chitosan removed of part of the acetyl. It has excellent film-forming, adsorption, permeability and permeability. In addition, it is rich in amino and hydroxy and it is also used as a film-forming material in the preparation of the chemical sensor. However, CS is prone to swelling, and it is capable of sliding off the electrode surface. Based on this, it becomes a hot spot for modifying CS to enhance its film forming.

Current fraud detection models, as precise as they are, tend to be black boxes that offer little or no interpretability to decision-makers. In response to this problem, this proposed model introduces a new cybersecurity risk assessment framework based on Explainable AI (XAI), which integrates XGBoost for predictive modeling with SHAP for interpretability. The model is learned and tested on a real-world UK FinTech fraud data sample with more than 250,000 transactions. The results show better performance in the main metrics, reaching 99.2% accuracy. SHAP integration provides additional transparency by enabling stakeholders to visualize feature contributions both globally and locally. In contrast to standard models, the new approach not only enhances fraudulent detection performance. Its simplicity and transparency features make it particularly appropriate for deployment in resource-limited FinTech startup settings."

    "abstract": "Today’s networked cyber-physical environments contain a wide range of agents, including fixed sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which help accomplish the objective(s) of a given mission. These collaborating agents support informed decision making for humans to accomplish mission objectives such as surveillance or search and rescue. However, these agents and their sensors are subject to various failures, including power, communication, hardware, and environmental factors. In contested environments, these failures also result from the kinetic or cyber actions of the adversary. This can result in conflicting information and the loss of a shared notion of the truth, leading to impaired situational awareness and poor decision-making. To overcome this challenge, we present ConflictResolver, a policy-driven knowledge-graph framework that can identify agents that share conflicting information and resolve conflicts using agent negotiation and reasoning. In doing so, it also infers/updates the trustworthiness measures of the sensing agents. This framework analyzes the information available within the collaborative agents to identify conflicts, acquire mission-critical objectives from the operator, determine triggering actions, and self-organize and reconfigure the agents’ capabilities in accordance with mission-criticality to remain resilient in contested environments. As part of our test bed, we deploy UGVs equipped with multimodal sensors to demonstrate how agents handle conflicts and establish trust."

Conventional boost converters commonly used in EV chargers face challenges such as high current ripple, increased switching stress, lower efficiency at high power, and limited integration with multiple energy sources. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a high-performance interleaved four-port boost converter for EV battery charging. The four-port topology allows simultaneous connection of grid supply, solar photovoltaic (PV) input, battery storage, and auxiliary power, making it highly suitable for hybrid and renewable-based charging systems. The interleaved configuration with a 90° phase shift significantly reduces input and output current ripple, ensures balanced current sharing among switches, and improves thermal management. The proposed converter achieves efficiency exceeding 90%, maintains stable voltage levels, and enhances component longevity. Moreover, the multiport design provides greater flexibility, enabling seamless integration of renewable energy sources without compromising charging performance. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed topology compared to traditional converters, exhibiting lower ripple, improved stability, and more efficient power delivery."

The inability to consistently differentiate between applicants with good credit and those prone to default is a major obstacle, particularly considering that conventional credit granting was dependent on human experts' subjective assessments and rule-based determinations. This paper has strengthened credit risk evaluation, improved cash flow, reduced financial risks, and supported sound managerial decisions by adopting more systematic methodologies like behavioural management and credit scoring to tackle these problems. This study delves into the ways data preprocessing, particularly Truncated SVD, impacts the precision and resilience of financial risk assessment and prediction. Feature extraction is carried out using PCA. This study proposes a MNCGF. The convolutional network may extract global or local picture characteristics. Comparing and contrasting embedding pairs from different networks trains the model to learn features at different image scales. With an F1-Score of 94.96%, the experimental findings show that the MNCGF model works well.

    "abstract": "Hybrid-trusted Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks face unique security challenges due to semi-trusted nodes. These nodes may introduce security threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks and key storage side-channel leakage. With the increasing complexity of QKD network architectures and expanding application scenarios, substantial divergences have emerged between user requirements for communication duration and cryptographic security demands. To address security challenges in hybrid-trusted QKD environments and provide differentiated services for users with varying requirements, this paper proposes a Service Requirement-based Hybrid-Trusted QKD Network (SRHT-QKDN) routing scheme. We propose a time-slot allocation model for QKD that employs time-slot resources as substitutes for key-generation resources in resource allocation processes. For sustained key distribution required by prolonged communications, the scheme implements two distinct time slot allocation algorithms: continuous-consistent and discrete-inconsistent allocation, enabling periodic quantum key updates. Concurrently, QKD requests are classified into three security levels, with corresponding routing strategies developed for each tier to achieve security service differentiation while maintaining routing success rates. Simulations conducted under four distinct operational conditions demonstrate that the SRHT-QKDN routing scheme not only effectively fulfills key continuity requirements but also achieves optimal overall performance in request success rate and security assurance, outperforming two benchmark routing schemes."

    "abstract": "This study presents an AI-powered object detection framework for the automated recognition of tic behaviors associated with Tourette Syndrome, specifically targeting early diagnosis among Filipino youth. Using the Roboflow 3.0 Object Detection (Accurate) model, the system was trained and validated on a curated dataset consisting of annotated video sequences representing both motor and facial tics. The proposed model achieved a validation mAP@50 of 81.8%, with corresponding precision and recall scores of 68.8% and 78.4%, respectively. These results demonstrate the model’s capability to accurately detect and classify tic-related movements, thereby meeting the primary objective of developing an automated bioTic classification framework for Tourette Syndrome analysis. While the results confirm effective generalization across the dataset, the performance under stricter thresholds—mAP@50:95 plateauing between 0.48 and 0.55—reveals persistent challenges in fine-grained spatial localization. This limitation aligns with prior studies employing YOLO and CNN-based architectures for tic detection, where models exhibited strong overall recognition but struggled with precise localization under higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) criteria. Despite these constraints, the findings affirm that the proposed model provides a promising foundation for AI-assisted early screening and monitoring of Tourette Syndrome. The integration of localized datasets and advanced feature extraction techniques underscores the system’s potential for deployment in clinical and educational settings to support early intervention efforts."

    "abstract": "Performance of video streaming, which accounts for most of the traffic in wireless communication, can be significantly improved by caching popular videos at the wireless edge. Determining the cache content that optimizes performance (defined via a revenue function) is thus an important task, and prediction of the future demands based on past history can make this process much more efficient. However, since practical video caching networks involve various parties (e.g., users, (wireless) internet service provider (ISP), and content service provider (CSP)) that do not wish to reveal information such as past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required. Motivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users’ privacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions—obtained from a trained Transformer—to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot future demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and decreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the impact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we formulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement decisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to efficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that (i) the FL solution achieves results close to the centralized (non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide different solutions than the classical cache hit ratio (CHR) criterion."

By integrating nonlinear characteristic theory with the mixer’s performance attributes, an effective modeling approach is developed for conversion loss and nonlinearity. Comparative analysis between simulation results and measured data demonstrates excellent agreement, with the simulated curves closely matching the actual measurement patterns.

    "abstract": "Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites earlier—referred to as primary systems—are given spectrum access priority over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users. Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies; therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users. Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline, achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "A key demand in contemporary VLSI design is minimizing power consumption, particularly in arithmetic circuits where switching activity predominates. Conventional irreversible architectures, which are based on NAND and NOR circuitry, generate heat and are less efficient since they automatically destroy information during computing. This restriction is overcome by reversible logic, which maintains information, guarantees bijective input-output mapping, and minimizes energy loss. In contrast to conventional reversible designs based on Feynman and Peres gates, this paper suggests a reversible full adder with just 12 transistors, which represents an 81% reduction in transistor count and roughly 78% lower power dissipation. In order to maximize resource utilization and energy efficiency, the design generates restricted trash outputs and uses a constant input to preserve reversibility. HSPICE simulation results show that the circuit operates steadily at supply voltages between 0.5 and 1.5 volts. Additionally, the suggested design's energy efficiency is confirmed by the constantly low power-delay product (PDP) and energy-delay product (EDP) values. The suggested complete adder is ideal for low-power processors, energy-constrained VLSI applications, and next-generation reversible computing because of its fewer transistors, small area consumption, and stable performance under voltage scaling."

To address this challenge, we propose an efficient multi-level gate-level post-simulation methodology. To validate the proposed method, we design a SoC chip circuit which integrates 2 DDR4 controllers, 4 CPU cores, and employ the commercial Electronic Design Automatic (EDA) tools to obtain the DDR controller circuit netlist, and Standard Delay Format (SDF) files as the post-simulation input files. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed multi-level gate-level post-simulation method achieves a $4 \\times$ speedup in functional post-simulation for the DDR controller circuit in SoC design, while also validating the effectiveness of the approach."

The increasing availability of compact, low-cost mmWave systems has made them particularly appealing for low-power platforms in mission-critical tactical scenarios. However, traditional SAR imaging demands extensive sampling, leading to significant delays and excessive data collection—particularly in environments where only a small subset of the scene contains mission-relevant information.To overcome this inefficiency, we introduce mmPrism, a perception-aware attention scheduling framework for mmWave radar that intelligently concentrates sensing and computation on Target Areas of Interest (TAIs). By combining rapid coarse scanning with spotlight-mode SAR under the control of a perception-aware TAI scheduler, mmPrism reduces unnecessary overhead while preserving task-relevant detail. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in recognition throughput and latency, with minimal compromise in imaging resolution."

People’s feelings play a significant role in their conversations. It could be useful for machines to recognize and respond to human emotions in various areas, such as healthcare, education, customer service, and virtual assistants. Deep learning technologies have made significant strides in recent years, improving the performance of systems that handle speech-related tasks. SER has also seen major advancements due to the development of complex neural network designs. This paper offers an in-depth look at current research in SER, focusing on studies that use deep learning techniques. It compares the most effective models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, transformers, and hybrid models. This study also talks about the most important things that affect SER performance, such as choosing speech emotion datasets and features. This review additionally discusses about the problems and limitations that current SER research faces. For example, datasets are not very diverse, emotions are hard to represent, speakers and languages are dependent on each other, and it is hard to use the technology in real time. This paper seeks to provide substantial insights for researchers on SER by synthesizing findings from multiple recent studies."

The design emphasizes portable experiment code, clear separation of data collection from learning logic, and compatibility with Gym-style agents to accelerate reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.

As a result, new approaches to charging EVs are appearing on the market, with WEVC showing great promise over older, more inconvenient methods. WEVC is particularly appealing for EV and PHEV applications in fixed contexts since it avoids plug-in issues while giving greater convenience, simplicity, and reliability. This study investigates a data-driven charging method that makes use of vibration signals to extract three charging features at the segment level using feature extraction techniques; the goal is to push this area forward. Afterwards, these features are fed into an RL-SVM model, which uses RL to optimise hyperparameters and boost the efficiency of SVM for charging problem diagnostics. A public rolling bearings dataset was used for experimental validation, which proved that the model was better than other methods. In terms of MAE, the RL-SVM model outperforms RL, SVM, and K-means by 9.47%, 4.50%, 1.65%, and 16.28%, respectively.

This model can account for the high-dimensional, non-stationary, and nonlinear characteristics of financial market data. As the basis of modeling, the ASTE method adaptively encodes the importance of information at different frequencies and time scales through a learnable spectral–temporal weight mechanism. This operation can achieve dynamic extraction of short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. The model then inputs the encoded features into a hybrid neural network. The network integrates convolution, recursion, and self-attention modules and can simultaneously capture local nonlinear patterns, short-term and long-term dependencies, and global feature interactions. In order to improve the generalization ability of the model, the final model also introduces temporal smoothing and entropy regularization constraints. The experimental validation phase adopted the multidimensional time series data from major markets in China, the United States, and Europe from August 2015 to August 2025. The training, validation, and test sets are collections of approximately 720,000 data points.

The cross-market AUC increased by more than 10%, the RMSE dropped by 15.9%, and the AUC improved by 11.9% when compared to the top competitive model. The robustness of the model was further confirmed by multi-factor ablation tests.

To overcome these struggles, we propose a detection system that to analyze and identify the forest loss in specified range of forest. Sentinel-2 satellite image is used to discover the deforestation by applying the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Change Detection algorithms, which are widely used to measure vegetation health and detect variations in forest cover. By comparing old and new satellite images on a monthly basis, the system predicts changes in vegetation and calculates key indicators such as NDVI %, Change %, and Tree Loss %. The results are then delivered through a role-based platform, where administrators can manage analyses and generate reports, while forest officers receive timely alerts whenever NDVI predicts forest’s critical condition. This approach ensures accurate, software-based, and efficient monitoring, solving the struggles of manual surveys by enabling faster detection, reliable reporting, and proactive forest conservation measures."

Traditional cybersecurity techniques are becoming insufficient to deal with the emerging trends, including covert attacks like backdoor attacks that interfere with the model integrity during the training of the model and interfere with outputs. A new, multi-layered smart cyber defence framework demanding a combination of threat modelling, data protection, and model protection has been presented in this paper to protect deep learning concept. The framework model is a permutation of both statistical and intelligent methods to avoid data privacy and confidentiality and extends structural measures of security management in terms of policies and procedures. It also presents ways of improving the sturdiness of models alongside attacks with the help of an adaptive threat model to identify the vulnerable points and implement countermeasures efficiently. An overview of back door attacks and defence mechanisms to back door attacks is given and a qualitative comparison of strategies in existence has been made.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a deep learning-based image inpainting and restoration algorithm that takes into consideration both irregular and structured degradations using Partial Convolutional Networks (PConv), convolutional autoencoders and U-Net networks. The pipeline of the framework has three stages, PConv, Autoencoder, and U-Net, each with specialized roles: PConv performs a structure-aware filling of missing or corrupted sections of the picture, the autoencoder smooths out fine details and removes noise artifacts, and U-Net balances global and local features to be perceptually consistent. A hybrid loss function that incorporates masked reconstruction loss, structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and perceptual losses is used to direct the model to create visually plausible output. The learning method is tested on several official benchmark datasets that include free-form masks and real-life degradation patterns, where its performance in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) is compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, showing an improvement by large margins. The experiments validate the performance of hybridization of structure-aware completion, feature refinement, and multi-scale semantic integration to restore image robustly."

In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements."

    "abstract": "Accurate interpretation of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is critical for oral diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing methods for automated tooth segmentation in CBCT face challenges, such as difficulties in generalizing across imaging artifacts and anatomical variations, as well as requiring manual revisions in many cases. To address these limitations, this study introduces ToothSeg, a fully automated approach for tooth instance segmentation and numbering in CBCT using deep learning and self-correction. ToothSeg combines semantic and instance segmentation into a unified method where their respective strengths are complemented. In particular, self-correction is employed when combining the segmentations, resolving merged or split teeth and determining the optimal sequence of tooth numbers for each dental arch. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using a diverse in-house dataset (n = 1282, 25+ devices) and the publicly available ToothFairy2 challenge dataset (n = 480, 1 device), including an ablation study, a comparison to state-of-the-art methods, and an analysis of challenging cases. Compared to an optimized semantic segmentation model, including instance segmentation and self-correction consistently improved tooth segmentation (True Positive Dice: 93.6% to 94.3%) and tooth detection and numbering (multiclass instance F1: 94.2% to 95.5%). Furthermore, ToothSeg outperformed the other methods on both datasets (True Positive Dice: <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol{\\ge }$</tex-math></inline-formula> +0.4%, multiclass instance F1: <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol{\\ge }$</tex-math></inline-formula> +1.8%), particularly for challenging cases.

    "abstract": "The naval air defense planning (NADP) problem entails the defense of a naval fleet against aerial threats. This complex and dynamic problem requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to evolving warfare environment. While our previous work addressed the static NADP problem by proposing a mathematical model and heuristic solutions for sensor allocation, engagement scheduling, and ship routing, this study extends to the dynamic NADP problem. Unlike the static version, which assumes complete knowledge of future threats, the dynamic NADP problem requires continuous updates and real-time adjustments to decisions as new threats emerge and situational parameters change. We present modifications in the mathematical formulation, which is based on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, alongside a comprehensive simulation structure. We employ heuristic solution approaches that utilize a combination of a genetic algorithm, construction of an engagement graph to solve the shortest path problem, and dynamic programming (DP) techniques. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing the dynamic NADP problem. The study also explores machine learning models for threat prioritization, offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by dynamic naval air defense scenarios."

    "abstract": "Urban customized bus (UCB) has become an important mode of urban transportation in recent years. To further enhance the applicability of UCB, we develop a UCB model that accommodates flexible pick-ups and drop-offs in this article. In our model, when a bus passes through a station, it can drop off passengers whose destination is exactly this station and pick up new passengers as long as constraints are satisfied. By eliminating fixed boarding and alighting regions that were commonly adopted in prior studies, we can provide travel services for both prebooked and real-time orders across broader temporal and spatial ranges. Under such a scenario, it is more challenging to decide when and where to pick up which passenger with which bus, and which route the bus chooses. To solve these intractable problems, we proposed an approach including passenger assignment and route design. For passenger assignment, we devise an ant colony system (ACS) method and a greedy method to assign prebooked and real-time passengers to buses, respectively. ACS represents the correlation among different passengers numerically through a pheromone matrix and updates it iteratively based on the good results. Therefore, prebooked passengers with higher correlations are more likely to be assigned to the same buses. The greedy method always selects passengers with the highest heuristic value to have a fast response in real-time passenger assignment. For route design, we adapt a Dijkstra-based greedy method to efficiently design routes for each bus in both static and dynamic situations. At last, experiments based on both generated data and real data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

Comprehensive multi-dimensional characterization is critical yet remains challenging for conventional techniques. In this work, we proposed an ultrafast gated hyperspectral imaging (UGHSI) system that synchronously captures spatial, spectral, and temporal dynamics in miniaturized LEDs, addressing the growing demand for high-resolution, multi-dimensional analysis of their complex transient behaviors. High-resolution two-dimensional (2-D) time-resolved electroluminescence (TREL) measurements are applied to demonstrate the system’s sub-micron spatial resolution and 500 picosecond temporal resolution. To enhance measurement accuracy, an optimized fitting model is developed to compensate the impact of the falling time of the electrical pulse signal on fluorescence lifetime. The 2-D fluorescent lifetime mappings for green Mini/Micro-LEDs derived from the 2-D TREL reveal distinct carrier distribution patterns and luminescence behaviors. In particular, the lifetime mappings clarify the enhanced anomalous emission at the sidewalls of the Mini/Micro-LEDs. In general, the proposed system achieves multi-dimensional optoelectronic characteristics with improved resolution and flexibility, providing a cutting-edge tool for studying complex behaviors of the next-generation devices and materials at microscopic and picosecond scales."

A dynamic 3D measurement method based on order shifting temporal phase unwrapping (OSTPU) is proposed. It integrates true free-space adaptability, true color detection, and true 3D measurement. Unlike conventional phase unwrapping methods, OSTPU encodes fringe order shifts using Gray-coded patterns instead of assigning absolute fringe order values. This approach significantly reduces the number of independent numbers needed for accurate encoding. By encoding only eight unique codewords, both the efficiency and the robustness within a predefined depth range are effectively enhanced. Its transferable encoding strategy reduces complexity and enables plug-and-play. Channel-wise chromatic independence preserves high-fidelity color reproduction. Experimental results show the validity in real-world dynamic 3D measurement scenarios."

This paper investigates slide ablation during pantograph-lowering by incorporating heat dissipation from material evaporation, a factor not addressed in prior studies. First, a high-precision arc voltage acquisition system was developed and implemented under real railway conditions. This system served as the basis for validating the proposed Multiphysics-coupled transient arcing model. Subsequently, an ablation model was established to account for the effect of material evaporation on surface temperature evolution under transient arcing. Then, numerical simulations were conducted to reveal the temperature field distribution on the slide surface. Finally, the effects of pantograph-lowering voltages, pantograph-lowering speeds, and ambient wind speeds on the slide ablation were systematically analyzed. The results indicate that reducing the pantograph-lowering voltage and increasing the pantograph-lowering speed can effectively mitigate slide surface ablation. Furthermore, the transient arcing produces an arc-shaped ablation pit on the slide surface, with the peak temperature stabilizing at approximately 4000 K, close to the carbon sublimation point."

    "abstract": "This research focuses on improving the k- Anonymization for numerical attributes by optimizing the critical phases of clustering and generalization through a novel Segment Tree-Based k-Anonymization (STKA) framework. Traditional methods face significant limitations: sorted-based approaches require costly re-sorting (O(n log n)) for dynamic updates; unsorted methods rely on inefficient linear scans (O(n)) for range queries; and dynamic methods suffer from frequent recalculations causing performance bottlenecks. Beyond computational efficiency, ensuring robust data privacy while minimizing information loss remains a central challenge in anonymization. Excessive generalization often safeguards privacy at the expense of data utility, whereas insufficient anonymization risks sensitive information disclosure. The proposed STKA framework effectively balances this trade-off by achieving optimal partitioning that enhances privacy protection while preserving high data usability. The proposed STKA framework addresses the aforementioned limitations by achieving logarithmic time complexity O(log n) for both min-max range queries and updates, eliminating resorting and recalculations. Compared to traditional approaches, STKA demonstrates: (1) 67% faster build time than sortedbased methods like ISKA/IAKA when handling dynamic updates; (2) 89% improvement in query response time over unsorted methods like WF-C-means and PCAA; (3) 35% reduction in information loss compared to dynamic approaches like CASTLE and FAANST; and (4) superior scalability for both batch and streaming data with minimal computational overhead. The experimental evaluation on datasets up to 1M records shows that STKA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods (MRA, SKA, IAKA, ISKA, MIAE) across multiple k-values, achieving 14.8-24.1% information loss compared to 31.2-53.1% for traditional methods, thereby delivering a more privacypreserving yet information-rich anonymization framework for large-scale data environments."

These devices collect sensitive physiological and behavioral data, requiring reliable user authentication to ensure secure access by authorized users. However, few-shot scenarios with significant intra-class variability and limited training data make it challenging for models to capture complex feature interactions. In this paper, we propose a Ratio-Enhanced Feature Interaction (RE-FI) framework designed for wearable running data. RE-FI systematically constructs pairwise product and ratio-based cross features to explicitly model second-order interactions and applies information gain–based feature selection to retain the most discriminative features. We provide theoretical justification for these design choices across linear models, tree-based classifiers, and deep neural networks. We validate RE-FI on real-world running data using nine representative classifiers. Results show that RE-FI consistently outperforms the baseline feature set across all classifiers, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.2% and up to 6.2% in F1-score. In extreme few-shot settings with only five samples per user, RE-FI maintains robust performance, with Random Forest achieving an average accuracy of 86%. Overall, this work offers a computationally simple feature-interaction solution that is compatible with diverse supervised models on session-level wearable statistical features and provides a principled approach for wearable security and personalized health monitoring in IoT applications."

It is the first attempt to apply a hybrid cavity with a dielectric slab and a shaped ground with power manipulation (SGPM) function. Different from traditional un-equal power dividers utilized in array, herein, we proposed the SGPM to manipulate power distribution on the radiation aperture of a RC antenna. In addition, due to the utilization of the dielectric slab, intrinsic partially reflection can be occurred at the aperture interface between the dielectric and air. This achieves RC response while eliminating the usage of a separate partially reflective surface (PRS), which is often independently required in a conventional RC antenna. For validation, a prototype using the proposed design method is fabricated and measured. Its profile is 0.25 λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>. The SLL of the design is less than 18 dB across the operating band.

Additionally, changes in electrical resistance caused by mechanical strain are utilized for detecting and mapping Stress and strain during physical activity, as well as identifying surface roughness and its impact on the athlete. This article introduces a Deep Transformer Learning Network (DTLN) based solution that combines transformer-based self-attention mechanisms with deep learning classifications to enhance strain detection accuracy. The DTLN addresses wavelength signal differences based on ascending intensities to compute the maximum difference between the impacting outputs and also classifies negative and positive differences. These outputs are correlated with the maximum strain acceptance factors to ensure that identified impacts on the sportsperson are accurately assessed. Therefore, the transformer learning classification is updated based on the previously trained difference to identify various wavelength intensities. Thus, the proposed method detects strain impacts over the sportsperson’s practice sessions. The proposed method improved strain detection by 13.2% and difference classification by 14.01%, reducing the error factor by 14.53% for average pressure. This work advances wearable sensor analytics by providing a scalable and accurate method for real-time strain impact assessment in athletic applications."

    "abstract": "High-end equipment development (e.g., CNC machine tools, lithography machines) drives demand for miniaturized, embedded, high-precision multi-degree-of-freedom motion measurement technologies. While laser interferometry provides non-contact, long-range precision measurements, conventional homodyne interferometry is environmentally sensitive, which limits its applications. Traditional methods usually use multiple beam-split elements to achieve spatial phase-shifting and collect interference signals with fixed phase differences through four incompletely co-pathed photodetectors to achieve common-mode suppression. However, it fails to eliminate path-specific noise and increasing system bulk. This paper proposes a novel method of shear phase-shifting and common-mode suppression for displacement interferometry. Polarization shearing is innovatively used to realize interferometric phase-shifting, and a Birefringent Crystal (BC) takes the place of the traditional complicated splitting and phase delay components. The new optical structure combined with the linear array photodetector can easily collect the interference signal with a fixed phase difference. Then, by parallel differential operation, the common-mode suppression can be realized in real time. The correction for DC error, AC amplitude inequality error, and non-orthogonality error is implemented by embedded digital processing. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed method has obvious anti-interference advantages and greatly simplifies the opto-mechanical structure. A prototype device was tested on a commercial linear stage, demonstrating 0.028 μm stability over 60 minutes and repeatability errors of ±0.032 μm, ±0.063 μm, ±0.046 μm, and ±0.110 μm at 25 mm, 50 mm, 75 mm, and 100 mm ranges, respectively,, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method and provides a new scheme with a simple structure and high precision for displacement interferometric measurement. The subsequent instrumentation design is capable of fulfilling the requirements of miniaturized embedded measurement."

    "abstract": "Underwater images typically suffer from severe color distortion, low contrast, and poor visibility due to light absorption and scattering in aquatic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Attention GAN (DA-GAN), specifically designed to enhance contrast and correct color distortions in underwater images. DA-GAN features three key innovations: a Hybrid CNN-Attention Bottleneck Layer (HCABL) for efficient enhancement of local and global features, a Transformer-based Channel Attention Module (TCAM) for color distortion removal, and a Multi-Color Space Loss function to improve contrast and visibility. HCABL employs parallel attention mechanisms and depth-wise separable convolutions to enhance both global context and local spatial details. TCAM enhances the model’s sensitivity to various color channels, enabling effective correction of complex color distortions. Furthermore, the Multi-Color Space Loss function, tailored for the HSV color space and the image’s bright and dark channels, further enhance contrast and visibility. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component, while extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that DA-GAN achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across six public underwater image datasets (SUIM, UIEB, EUVP, LSUI, UCCS and SQUID).

Existing methodologies that employ transfer learning and knowledge distillation encounter challenges with limited generalizability due to substantial intersubject variability and constrained data availability. Furthermore, their applicability is often questioned, as most lack comprehensive external validation and cross-script evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce P3-FSLNet, a few-shot metalearning framework that integrates prototypical networks and contrastive learning within a spatial-temporal convolutional neural network augmented by dual-channel attention for the selection of relevant electroencephalogram channels. Episodic metatraining facilitates the transfer of robust knowledge across different subjects. Evaluated on a self-recorded Devanagari script dataset, P3-FSLNet attains a classification accuracy of 93.17%, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 1%–14%, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by up to 400 times. External validation using English-script datasets from BCI Competition II and III confirms its robustness in cross-subject and cross-script generalization. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of P3-FSLNet and represent a substantial advancement toward the development of script-agnostic P300 spellers that are lightweight, scalable, and conducive to multilingual applications."

    "abstract": "In commercial complexes, the functional interwoven areas (FIA) with multiple attributes shops accommodate diverse population of pedestrians with heterogeneous travel purposes. A well-designed layout scheme of FIA can effectively increase the revenue while reduce the pedestrian congestion. However, existing layout schemes are more developed from the operator’s perspective, focusing on maximizing rents while neglecting shop attributes and pedestrians heterogeneity, which results in excessive corridor congestion and suboptimal store visit rates. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel macro-to-micro layout optimization framework that enhances pedestrian in-store rate while mitigating internal congestion. The proposed framework consists of two stages: 1) a macrolevel optimization model which generates multiple feasible layout schemes by using shop attributes based attractiveness algorithm; and 2) a microlevel simulation model which evaluates pedestrian movement dynamics and corridor density under different layouts by integrating an attractive potential based social force model (AP-SFM). Based on parameters calibrated from real collected data, we conduct extensive numerical and simulation experiments across two distinct commercial complexes: 1) China World Mall (CWM); and 2) Shin Kong Place (SKP). The results demonstrate that the optimized layouts significantly increase pedestrian in-store rates while effectively reducing average corridor density and alleviating local congestion, without altering the total pedestrian volume. Furthermore, the successful application in two distinct commercial complexes proves the validity, rationality, and generality of the proposed framework. Our research effectively integrates shop diversity and pedestrian heterogeneity into shop layout optimization, providing a practical and scalable decision-support tool for layout design and management."

Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of CVDs. However, the temporal resolution of current cardiac CT imaging techniques is still insufficient to freeze the beating heart. One solution to improve temporal resolution is fast data acquisition for a limited-angle range. Unfortunately, this approach introduces significant limited-angle artifacts that compromise image quality. Diffusion models have shown promising results to address this issue by effectively reconstructing missing data, but the process is typically time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel method for 3D limited-angle reconstruction using a diffusion model, optimized to significantly reduce computational time. Specifically, our approach integrates the regularized derivative least square (RDLS) algorithm with denoising diffusion implicit models. The numerical simulations and clinical data experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared with DDS, our method delivers a 1.8× speedup on the simulated dataset and a 3.4× speedup on the real clinical dataset."

This research advances the development of efficient spectrum sharing techniques in CRN by integrating cooperative spectrum sensing and power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA). As wireless systems are expected to utilize the spectrum resources efficiently, they must be able to mitigate interference with primary users and operate within the required throughput levels. Existing works consider either spectrum sensing or spectrum sharing separately, and often ignore the effect of cooperation and hybrid spectrum sharing on the overall system performance. This work presents and evaluates a novel framework that combines cooperative spectrum sensing and a hybrid interweave-underlay spectrum sharing mode for application in IoT-CRN. The network features multiple cognitive users (CUs) switching between interweave and underlay modes depending on availability of spectrum holes. This hybrid mode combines the advantages of opportunistically accessing the channel and transmitting with controlled power and interference. The model features a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based channel estimator sensing mechanism that enables individual CUs to determine the availability of holes. The formulated channel occupancy problem is evaluated using adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO). The occupancy is cooperatively shared to the fusion center (FC) for the final decision on the availability of PUs with penalties applied to misbehaving CUs. The results of the proposed model show a 28% and 35% better throughput performance than the existing models and a 15% higher probability of detection while accommodating different CU traffic."

    "abstract": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks provide global broadband. However, their high orbital velocity (7–8 km/s) causes frequent communication link variations, requiring feeder link switchover (FLSO) between LEO satellites and ground gateways (GWs). In the hard FLSO policy, LEO satellites trigger simultaneous user equipments (UEs) handovers (HOs) during FLSO, degrading service quality and increasing latency in non-terrestrial networks (NTN). In battlefield scenarios, frequent HOs in battery-powered equipments lead to power consumption, delay, and outage, impairing communication. In this paper, we proposes a reinforcement learning-based FLSO using a dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) to optimize FLSO and UE HO in dynamic environments. We achieve lower FLSO and UE HO occurrences and longer time-of-stay (ToS) compared to other algorithms, while maintaining satisfactory reference signal received power (RSRP) and channel capacity. The proposed algorithm also yields the fewest HOs across varying UE spatial dispersions."

Using this structure brings three benefits: 1) the lower supply sensitivity; 2) the better linearity of PTAT and CTAT voltages with the same area overhead; 3) the lower power consumption. A novel 8-bit successive approximation register (SAR) quantization scheme adjusts the capacitor ratio to drive the CTAT voltage to the PTAT voltage, achieving a linear output code.

    "abstract": "Gallium Nitride (GaN) power electronic devices represent a core technology of the third generation of semiconductor materials, with primary applications in high-efficiency power conversion and high-frequency, high-power systems. In half-bridge configurations, a dead time must be introduced to prevent shoot-through. However, due to the lack of an intrinsic body diode in GaN devices, the reverse conduction voltage drop during the dead time is significantly higher than that of silicon-based devices, leading to substantial reverse conduction losses. These losses are further exacerbated at high frequencies due to increased switching and reverse conduction losses. Therefore, adaptive dead-time control is essential for optimizing the trade-off between efficiency and reliability. This paper analyzes the impact of dead time on the efficiency and reliability of GaN gate driver integrated circuits and proposes a novel dead-time logic control architecture design. The proposed design comprises four key modules: a negative voltage detection module (NVDM), a negative voltage control module (NVCM), a dead-time logic control module (DTLCM), and a slope current detection module (SCDM). The NVDM identifies negative voltage within 5 ns, while the NVCM enables near-zero-latency dead-time adjustment. The SCDM estimates current switching based on the voltage slew rate at the switching node. The proposed design achieves a minimum dead time of 0.7 ns and a maximum of 10.5 ns. The variation range of the falling-edge dead time is 22.2% wider compared to existing dead-time architectures."

    "abstract": "Retina diseases that may permanently blind are choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), diabetic macular oedema (DME), and drusen. This brings out the importance of identifying them at an early age so that they can be treated and individuals do not end up blind. Nevertheless, retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images are difficult to assess manually, highly specialised and susceptible to observer variability thus posing a bottleneck in ocular diagnostics. This study introduces an automated sickness classifier of retinal OCT, having used the architecture of EfficientNetB7, a deep convolutional neural network with a distinguished characteristic of having outstanding scalability and accuracy through scaling of compounds. The proposed system is based on the OCT2017 dataset, containing approximately 84,000 OCT images that are classified into 4 categories: CNV, DME, drusen, and normal. Sizing down of images, normalisation of images and inclusion of lots of new data are all done to ensure that the model is capable of adjusting to variations in scan quality, patient demographics and imaging conditions. The model modulates the feature representations based on the characteristics of retinal disorders using the transfer learning using ImageNet-pretrained EfficientNetB7 weights. The validity of the system is experimentally determined to be very high, and accuracy of the system is balanced, as there is no difference in terms of precision, recall and the F1 scores between the different types of diseases. The confusion matrix analysis confirms that a reliable differentiation can be made even under the circumstances when it seems that two things are similar visually. It is a deep learning based solution that offers a scalable, high-performance, and effective solution in assisting eye doctors to make clinical judgements. It is beneficial to patients in the long run because it allows them to make diagnoses more accurately and faster."

A Trojan infected Debian package modifies core ROS 2 security commands to exfiltrate newly generated keystore credentials via DNS in base64-encoded chunks to an attacker-controlled nameserver. Possession of these credentials enables the attacker to rejoin the SROS 2 network as an authenticated participant and publish spoofed control or perception messages without triggering authentication failures. We evaluate this capability on a secure ROS 2 Humble testbed configured for a four-stop-sign navigation routine using an Intel RealSense camera for perception. Experimental results show that control-topic injections can cause forced braking, sustained high-speed acceleration, and continuous turning loops, while perception-topic spoofing can induce phantom stop signs or suppress real detections. The attack generalizes to any data distribution service (DDS)-based robotic system using SROS 2, highlighting the need for both supply chain integrity controls and runtime semantic validation to safeguard autonomous systems against insider and impersonation threats."

    "abstract": "Widespread wireless communication demands robust security management to prevent adversaries from exploiting ubiquitous radio signals. Traditionally, such security is enforced through mitigation strategies implemented at higher layers using symmetric and/or asymmetric cryptography. However, this introduces increasing complexity, particularly due to the key derivation and exchange mechanisms required. This challenge is further exacerbated in private networks, which often necessitate configuration and deployment at the tactical or ad-hoc level in hostile environments, where physical interception or cryptanalysis by adversaries is a significant risk.To address this, we propose a solution that performs key derivation by exploiting 5G waveforms and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This approach enables the extraction of highly correlated data between legitimate parties by leveraging the reciprocity of radio channels, while preventing eavesdroppers from replicating the key derivation process.In this demonstration, we show that incorporating physical-layer information introduces geographical awareness between communicating parties, without compromising the entropy and keys generation rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method effectively prevents eavesdroppers from obtaining the information needed to compromise the derived keys. Finally, we implement the system using software-defined radio within the 5G FR1 frequency bands, achieving a 100% key agreement rate with high entropy across a range of environments."

    "abstract": "Food quality and safety maintenance are needed in preventing foodborne illnesses and wastage reduction. Conventional food quality assessment machine learning models are inefficient in feature extraction, computationally expensive, and sensor data fusion limited. In this study, we propose QIH-FoodNet, a Quantum-Inspired Hybrid Deep Learning Model that is a fusion of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Capsule Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for real-time food quality assessment. The QNN enhances image-based feature extraction, the Capsule Network facilitates spatial feature representation, and the GNN addresses multimodal sensor data (pH, gas levels, temperature, and moisture). The proposed model is implemented in RStudio and evaluated on real-world food quality datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that QIH-FoodNet achieves 98.1% accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN-LSTM (92.5%) and Transformer-based (94.6%) models. Comparative assessment and visualization of food images, sensor data distributions, and classification metrics further attest to the stability of the proposed model. This study demonstrates QIH-FoodNet as an innovative, efficient, and interpretable AI-based food safety system suitable for real-time deployment in supply chains and smart food monitoring."

    "abstract": "Mining is a risky job, with miners face a host of hazards, including toxic gasses, restricted oxygen, poor visibility, and the ever-present chance of accidents. Reducing casualties and injuries requires real-time safety monitoring and prompt responses. This project proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled intelligent helmet, designed to improve miner safety. It will use sensors, radio frequency (RF) transmission, and location tracking with beacons. The system keeps a constant watch on environmental factors, identifying potential dangers. It then triggers immediate alerts, using both a buzzer and LED lights to signal the issue. Simultaneously, it relays real-time position data to a control center. This allows the supervisor, stationed there, to monitor the miners' activities below ground and react instantly if something goes wrong. The system's primary goal is to reduce the time it takes to respond and improve the effectiveness of rescues. The novelty of the system combines real-time radio frequency position tracking with sensor-based hazard detection. This allows for proactive safety measures, rather than reactive ones, which sets it apart from typical intelligent helmets that rely on health monitoring or gas detection."

The proposed method evaluates the approach in an NS 3 simulator (Rayleigh fading + AWGN, 1 MHz channel, 50 devices and Poisson traffic λ=0.1) against heuristic allocation, UCB MAB (which employs a conservative device disturbance component), traditional DQN and multi agent DRL. Our results show consistent gains across all metrics: the proposed agent achieves throughput 3.8, packet success rate 90, latency 60, energy per device 0.61 and fairness index 0.89 retaining model size ≈0.35M parameters cancelling out performance of baselines over throughput, reliability, latency and energy efficiency. Its light weight and online adaptability enable the approach for being deployed on embedded IoT nodes, and there are obvious ways to further validate it through testbed and even distributed learning."

In addition, assuming the estimate error of the action value of the DQN follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution, we analytically derive the expected loss.

Existing rehabilitation insoles also face limitations such as large sensor size, unstable power supply, and poor portability. This paper presents a wireless self-powered smart insole system that integrates a multilayer polytetrafluoroethylene-copper (PTFE-Cu) triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) array, low-power wireless electronics, and machine learning algorithms for real-time gait monitoring. The flexible TENG array, distributed across key plantar regions, enables spatially resolved pressure sensing without external power. Collected signals are transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a microcontroller and analyzed through intelligent algorithms to recognize normal gait as well as abnormal patterns. Experimental demonstrations confirm that the system can accurately capture plantar pressure waveforms, visualize gait dynamics, and classify abnormal gait with high reliability. By combining flexibility, portability, and autonomous power supply, the proposed smart insole provides a multifunctional platform for daily gait health management. It holds strong potential for preventive healthcare, clinical auxiliary diagnosis, rehabilitation assessment, and sports performance monitoring."

    "abstract": "In the wireless rechargeable sensor network (WRSN)-facilitated lake monitoring scenario, the remote and widespread distribution of sensor nodes (SNs) causes difficulties in their energy supply. Wireless energy transfer (WET) technology is promising to extend the lifespan of the SNs, which greatly promotes the sustainable development of lake monitoring networks. Jointly leveraging autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) and wireless charging vehicles (WCVs) with WET is a viable approach to surmount the energy supply issue. AAVs are with extraordinary flexibility and WCVs are with relatively abundant battery capacities. However, advanced AAVs and WCVs joint scheduling for efficient far-field wireless charging remains scarce. In this paper, we propose the SNs' wireless energy reception model, as well as energy consumption models for the AAVs and WCVs. We concentrate effort on the optimization problem on minimizing the energy consumption of the AAVs and WCVs, while ensuring more SNs can be fully powered. As this problem is proved to be NP-hard, we further propose a two-step solution featuring corresponding heuristic algorithms to efficiently resolve it. The solution strategically determines the AAVs' flying trajectories and the WCVs' anchor points. Finally, extensive simulation results have validated the superiority of our proposed solution."

This work compares a standard ResNet-18 model against a hybrid ResNet-18–Vision Transformer ResNet-18 ViT model for classifying fresh and rotten fruit and vegetable images. This work used a ResNet-18 backbone for feature extraction from the image, and the pre-trained ViT-B16 is used for the classification. Both the models are trained, tested, and validated on the Fresh and Rotten Classification dataset. The model is evaluated with the following performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for training, testing, and validation datasets. The ResNet-18 model achieves 98.77 percent training accuracy, 97.76 percent testing accuracy, and 98.40 percent validation accuracy. While the ResNet-18 ViT model achieves 99.40 percent training accuracy, 99.26 percent testing accuracy, and 99.37 percent validation accuracy. Our hybrid model consistently outperforms the standard ResNet-18, demonstrating that combining convolutional feature extractors with transformer-based global attention can improve classification of fruit and vegetable freshness.

    "abstract": "Internet of Battlespace Things (IoBT) deployments in adversarial environments face critical challenges in network resource management, where rapid environmental changes and dynamic threats render traditional optimization approaches inadequate. The inherently volatile nature of these environments, where network conditions can change within seconds, necessitates algorithms that prioritize speed over perfect optimization to maintain operational effectiveness. This paper presents a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework specifically designed for combinatorial task admission and routing optimization in dynamic IoBT networks. Our approach integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for capturing network topology dependencies, Deep Sets encoders for permutation-invariant task processing, Adaptive Path GNNs for learning path representations, and statistical feature encoders that complement learned embeddings with interpretable routing heuristics. The system formulates network optimization as a Markov Decision Process, enabling real-time decision-making that maximizes task utility while respecting capacity constraints and adapting to topology changes. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across multiple network scenarios demonstrates that our Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent consistently outperforms greedy baselines by 5-58%, achieving near-optimal utility with sub-second inference times compared to Mixed Integer Programming solvers that require hundreds of seconds. The framework shows strong generalization capabilities, with agents trained on smaller task sets effectively scaling to larger workloads, and exhibits superior performance when trained under dynamic conditions rather than static environments."

    "abstract": "Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) adopts energy-neutral devices to conduct communication and sensing tasks, leveraging energy harvesting (EH) from ambient energy resources, such as solar, radio frequency (RF) signals, and vibrations. Using ambient backscatter communication (AmBC), a backscatter device (BD) can modulate and reflect existing RF carrier waves to transmit its local sensing data obtained from the embedded sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel A-IoT scheme, where the BD uses modulated visible light as both energy source and communication frequency controller. Specifically, the alternating current (AC) component of photovoltaic-converted light controls the frequency of communication subcarriers, eliminating the use of a microcontroller unit (MCU) for such purpose. We model the link budget of the proposed system, including the optical link and RF backscatter link. To demonstrate the implementation feasibility of the proposed scheme, we present a proof-of-concept experimental setup using the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components. The experimental results show that the intermediate or subcarrier frequency of the backscattered signal can be shifted up to 10 MHz from the carrier, by configuring the modulation frequency of the visible light. The investigation demonstrates the feasibility of using visible light to control the subcarrier frequency of AmBC without MCUs, thereby providing extra flexibility for spectral arrangement and reducing the device cost in A-IoT systems."

This research examines deep learning automation for dental disease classification through assessment of six distinct oral conditions which include Calculus along with Caries and Gingivitis and furthermore integrates Ulcers with Tooth Discoloration and Hypodontia diagnosis. Medical imaging data availability requires dental professionals to receive reliable diagnostic support tools while education quality improves in dental AI technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Labeled images of the six disease classes formed the basis of this research and were processed into training, validation and testing subsets.

The examination of the model through training and evaluation methods showed excellent performance on all six classes.

Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over time."

It is estimated that the suggested GNFET-based quaternary circuits outperform CNFET designs in terms of power reduction by up to 21.76%, propagation delay by about 20%, and power–delay product by up to 71.52% for the complete adder. Comparative findings show that, in comparison to their CNFET counterparts, GNFET-based circuits significantly improve propagation delay, power dissipation, and power–delay product (PDP). The suggested method's scalability for increasingly intricate arithmetic systems is further demonstrated by the modular full adder implementation. nanotechnology.

Authenticated Encryption (AE) guarantees confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity, making it a vital security service for IoT. However, current deployed (lightweight) AE standards lack essential features like key compromise resiliency and compact authentication tags, as well as performance enhancements such as offline-online cryptography. To address these gaps, we propose Graphene, the first (to our knowledge) symmetric Forward-secure and Aggregate Authenticated Encryption (FAAE) framework designed for the performance and security demands of low-end IoT infrastructures. Graphene innovates by synergizing key evolution strategies and offline-online cryptographic processing with Universal Message Authentication Codes (UMACs) to guarantee breach-resiliency, near-optimal online latency, and compactness. We demonstrate Graphene’s efficiency through two distinct instantiations, each balancing unique performance trade-offs with extensibility for diverse MACs. Our experimental evaluation on commodity hardware and 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller shows Graphene’s significant performance gains over existing alternatives. Graphene is also backward compatible with standard-compliant cryptographic implementations. We release our implementation as open source for public testing and adaptation."

In this paper, we present a tightly-coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry system with geometric uncertainty modeling framework for accurate and robust state estimation. The proposed LIO system is designed by an Iterative Error State Kalman Filter (IESKF) to effectively fuse LiDAR and IMU measurement, and employs the voxel structure to query and update LiDAR features. To observe the reliability of geometric measurements, we propose novel uncertainty models of LiDAR point, line and plane features, and apply them to construct point-to-line and point-to-plane constraints. In the maximization of posterior state estimation, we propagate the uncertainties of geometric constraints to the iterative error state Kalman filter, further consider the weights of geometric constraints, and enrich the comprehensiveness of the geometric residuals. To reduce the memory consumption of the system, we propose a cumulative update method with uncertainty parameters to avoid repeated parameter computations. We extensively evaluate our method in diverse public datasets. The results validate the high precision and robustness of the proposed method when compared to other state-of-the-art methods in challenge scenes with high perceptual uncertainties."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a new resilient service restoration approach for a multienergy distribution system (MDS) following unexpected large contingencies. The repair scheduling and MDS restoration are optimally coordinated through a two-stage coordinated framework. To fully exploit the network flexibility during the recovery process, a joint network reconfiguration model is proposed to regulate the switching operations between the power distribution network and the district heating network (DHN). To effectively model the reconfigurable property, the DHN is formulated as a quasi-linear energy flow model for mathematical tractability. Besides, diverse uncertainties from the power, heat, and traffic networks are handled via a two-stage stochastic program. The proposed model is linearized and formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem considering detailed network operational and temporal-spatial constraints. Furthermore, to accelerate the solution process, a penalty-based Gauss–Seidel decomposition algorithm is developed to decompose and solve the proposed MILP problem efficiently. Finally, comprehensive case studies are done to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and solution method."

    "abstract": "High-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG) signals play a crucial role in a wide range of biomedical and healthcare applications by providing rich spatial electrophysiological information. However, the detection of HD-sEMG, particularly when using large-area, multi-channel electronic skins, is susceptible to various noise interference caused by poor adhesion or channel failure of the electrode array, motion interference, and hardware instabilities, leading to complex and widespread signal corruption. Current signal processing and restoration methods often focus on temporal features within individual channels, without further exploiting the underlying low-rank structure and cross-channel spatial correlations inherent in high-density electrode arrays, thereby limiting the signal recovery and denoising performance in complex, noisy environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive low-rank completion framework (ALF_SVT) , based on singular value thresholding (SVT), for robust HD-sEMG signal recovery. The method operates directly on 2D EMG maps and adaptively exploits their low-rank structure, temporal stability, and spatial correlation for signal recovery. Experimental results show that compared to conventional recovery methods, the proposed approach delivers a 64.8% improvement in average restoration accuracy, achieving an overall recovery accuracy of 86.3% under 49% signal loss or corruption. In addition, ALF-SVT demonstrated a classification performance of 95.5% for seven hand motion classes under 40.2% signal loss or corruption. This work demonstrated that the proposed method can robustly recover signals not only in noise interference scenarios but also when they are severely distorted by large-scale data loss or hardware-induced amplitude corruption."

    "abstract": "Cloud-assisted resource-constrained and widely used outdoor IoT devices deploying highly robust convolutional neural network (CNN) models to provide high-quality visual services have attracted widespread attention from industry and academia. Most existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) large amount of parameter transmission, and (ii) low robustness in handling data affected by the environment. To this end, this paper proposes a transmission-friendly and robust CNN design method called NonLinear transformation generation Filter with NonLearnable hyperparameters, namely NL2Filter. In NL2Filter, some filters are first designated as seed filters, whose parameters are learnable, that is, updated as the model is trained. Other filters in this layer are generated based on the seed filters and nonlinear transformation function (NLF). The hyperparameters of the NLF in NL2Filter are randomly initialized and remain unchanged, so they can be saved and reproduced using random seed. After the cloud server trains the NL2Filter-CNN model, it only needs to send a small number of learnable parameters and random seed to reproduce the CNN model trained by the cloud server. Compared with sending the complete CNN model, sending only a small number of learnable parameters and random seed can significantly reduce the number of model parameters sent by the cloud server. On the other hand, NL2Filter groups seed filters and then uses NLFs with different hyperparameters to generate diverse filters on demand for each group, thereby improving the model's ability to capture feature diversity without increasing the complexity of the model, thereby improving the model's robustness in processing data affected by the environment. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, and Icons-50 datasets demonstrate that the proposed NL2Filter outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, using the ResNet-101 architecture, on the CIFAR-10-C, NL2Filter's accuracy is about 3.9% higher than that of MonoCNN; On the Icons-50, NL2Filter's accuracy is about 2.7% higher than that of MonoCNN and about 2.3% higher than that of the standard ResNet-101."

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication performance by exploiting the new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization. In this letter, we investigate the MA-enhanced wide beam coverage over multiple subregions in the spatial domain. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired subregions by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna position vector (APV). Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional fixed position antennas (FPAs) and achieve a comparable performance to the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with dramatically lower complexity."

But these advancements have also had the effect of making the issue of data integrity, as well as confidentiality and authentication, much more pressing. To ensure the safe transfer and storage of medical images and keep the diagnostic results reliable, this work introduces the Adaptive Deep Neural Defense (ADND) framework. To overcome the shortcomings of existing systems, the proposed model uses a combination of the deep learning method and advanced data security practices. The basis for a good encryption system is preliminary determined by segmenting and identifying homogeneous regions in medical images by the K-Means clustering. Data confidentiality is enhanced when transmitting via a hybrid chaotic map based encryption and channel security technique. A combination Random forest (RF) and Support vector machine (SVM) is applied for intelligent classification and anomaly detection purpose for evaluating and improving overall resiliency of the systems. When compared to traditional security frames, ADND scores highly in terms of accuracy, privacy retention, and data integrity based on experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets of medical images.

In this paper, we introduce VeriPHY, a novel deep learning-based PLA solution for 5G networks, which enables unique device identification by embedding signatures within wireless I/Q transmissions using steganography. VeriPHY continuously generates pseudo-random signatures by sampling from Gaussian Mixture Models whose distribution is carefully varied to ensure signature uniqueness and stealthiness over time, and then embeds the newly generated signatures over I/Q samples transmitted by users to the 5G gNB. Utilizing deep neural networks, VeriPHY identifies and authenticates users based on these embedded signatures. VeriPHY achieves high precision, identifying unique signatures between 93% and 100% with low false positive rates and an inference time of 28 ms when signatures are updated every 20 ms. Additionally, we also demonstrate a stealth generation mode where signatures are generated in a way that makes them virtually indistinguishable from unaltered 5G signals while maintaining over 93% detection accuracy."

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) and Terahertz (THz) technologies are both key visions for 6G, yet they face practical challenges arising from severe nonlinear distortion in high-power amplifiers (HPA) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) effects. Very recently, a novel waveform named Frequency-Modulated Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (FM-OFDM) is proposed to handle the aforementioned issues. However, the FM-OFDM signal experiences severe phase jumps that cause errors in phase demodulation. To deal with this problem, we propose Frequency-Modulated Single-Carrier OFDM (FM-SC-OFDM), wherein real-valued SC-OFDM is employed as the instantaneous frequency sequence in FM-OFDM. Based on the proposed FM-SC-OFDM, we develop a THz ISAC framework, elaborating on its demodulation methods and range/velocity estimation schemes. We then derive the achievable bit error rate (BER) lower bound and the sensing Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in closed-form, providing insights into how the key parameters (e.g., modulation index) affect the ISAC performance. Numerical results and hardware-based experiments further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FM-SC-OFDM framework, which almost achieves the BER lower bound while marginally improving the sensing performance as compared with FM-OFDM."

To address this issue, in this paper we present FUSCO (Fusion-based Semantic Corner-case reasoning), an agentic, distributed machine learning pipeline that dynamically fuses RGB camera and LiDAR data leveraging an edge computing architecture. In the proposed framework, a pretrained large vision language model (LVLM) deployed at the edge server processes RGB images produced by the vehicle to generate Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, machine readable subject, predicate, object assertion that describe specific corner cases. A confidence-aware prompt engine then decides whether to invoke multimodal fusion: if the adjusted confidence falls below a threshold, the edge server requests LiDAR bird’s eye view scans produced by a specialized deep neural network model, and reissues an augmented prompt combining RGB and LiDAR inputs. This selective fusion controls both data transmission and compute by invoking the communication and compute-intense LiDAR maps only when needed. FUSCO operates in zero-shot mode without any model retraining, preserving low latency in some environmental conditions, and adapting seamlessly under uncertainty. Experiments on synthetic (3CSim) and real-world (KITTI) benchmarks demonstrate up to a 24 % absolute F1 gain in low-visibility corner cases, while reducing average data transmission by 35 %, and enabling consistent, ontology-aligned vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication."

However, hardware imperfections such as power amplifier (PA) nonlinearities become a limiting factor when many low-cost radio-frequency chains operate in parallel. Conventional mitigation techniques either rely on accurate distortion models or require expensive digital pre-distortion (DPD) at each transmitter. In this paper we propose a hardware-aware end-to-end (E2E) learning framework for the downlink of a CF-mMIMO network. The transmitter employs a neural network (NN) encoder hosted at the central processing unit that encodes each user data symbol. These symbols are then locally precoded by a full-pilot zero-forcing (FZF) matrix at each AP and transmitted before being received and classified by a second NN decoder at each user terminal. The encoders and decoders are trained jointly in an offline phase to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss on a large dataset of randomly drawn quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols and channel realizations. Once trained, the solution operates without requiring any knowledge of the PA model. Simulation results show that the proposed E2E framework achieves lower symbol error rate (SER) than a conventional FZF precoder with and without DPD, especially in the hardware-impairment-dominated regime. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is scalable and operates without backpropagation over the fronthaul during inference."

This work uses machine learning to investigate how diabetes risk prediction changes with age, which is a major risk factor. The Proposed approach introduce a technique that joins dataset preparation, feature selection, and missing value imputation to fix data imbalance and boost predictive accuracy. The Diabetes Health Indicators dataset was utilized for training, with feature vectors serving as supervised labels.

The key contributions of this work are: 1) Evaluating multiplyaccumulate (MAC) errors in a 6T-SRAM CIM macro across various linearity levels. 2) Introducing an Adaptive Non-linearity Dynamic Quantization algorithm designed to enhance CNN robustness against hardware-induced errors. 3) Quantifying the “partial sum errors” arising from the physical limitations of ACIM and providing accurate MVM error metrics for the ANDQ-NAT framework. Experimental results show that, compared with the NAT with uniform quantization, when performing inference on the CIFAR10 dataset, the ANDQ-NAT framework improves the inference accuracy of the ResNet20 network by 22.01% (low-linearity) and 13.68% (high-linearity) respectively, and improves the inference accuracy of the VGG8 network by 26.07% (low-linearity) and 15.75% (high-linearity). This verifies the effectiveness of the framework under different ACIM configurations."

    "abstract": "A typical objective of frequency band allocation to cellular users in a multi-cell network environment is to maximize system sum-rate in the presence of inter-cell interference, while ensuring that users within the same cell do not experience interference and each user is assigned to only one base station. This is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, and its computational complexity increases significantly with increasing network size. This paper proposes a novel approach using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to efficiently allocate frequency bands while maximizing system sum-rate. The proposed model divides the task into high- and low-level policies, enhancing both global resource management and local interference control. Simulation results demonstrate that the HRL-based method outperforms traditional allocation strategies in terms of the trade-off between throughput and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Image Steganography is among the most secure methods of data hiding which entirely undetectable even in the case of digital images. One of the secrets of the proposed system is that it is capable of combining steganography with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to up the ante of the security of the hidden message. AES is regarded as a very powerful symmetric key encryption method and thus it keeps the secret data away from the eyes of others. Moreover, the Dynamic Pixel Mapping technique is applied to further randomize the embedding process making it extremely hard for the attackers to determine the position of the concealed information. The system performs an efficient dual operation of hiding and encrypting resulting in super high confidentiality and strength. The message that is embedded is encrypted in such a manner that there is no change in the visual quality of the cover image. This is the technique that allows having a smaller distortion and thus a higher chance of defeating steganalysis attacks. The entire process of encrypting messages in images can be done in a very quick and efficient manner over untrusted networks for the purpose of secure communication and data protection. In conclusion, this project introduces a very reliable and smart solution for the protection of sensitive data by means of image-based steganography."

We propose an optimization-based method that explores diverse, structurally feasible edge distribution candidates and optimizes node distributions via a constrained linear system formulation. A dual annealing optimizer is then applied to identify node profiles that maximize the decoding threshold. Evaluations on both the binary erasure channel and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel across multiple code rates show that our method consistently produces ensembles with strong threshold performance and low edge complexity, highlighting its practicality and adaptability."

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) in Robot Operating Systems (ROS) has increased the vulnerability of cyberattacks, causing disastrous interference in autonomous and industrial activities. Recent cybersecurity studies show that on average almost 47 percent of ROS-based networks are vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) and reconnaissance attacks, whereas approximately 52% of IoT-enabled robotic environments are being unlawfully observed or leak information. To address these shortcomings, the proposed work presents methodological proposal of Cyber-Physical IoT-based ROS-based Robotic Attack Classification (CP-IoT-RAC) framework to be used in data-driven and automated fashion. The model utilizes a formal set of data that has three broad classes of attackssuch as DoS, Observe, and ROS2-reconnaissancereflecting real-world CPS network intrusions. The data is processed extensively, which involves data normalization, noise elimination, and feature scaling, providing balanced and quality input during the learning stage. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN2D) classifier is then developed to learn finer spatial-temporal features on the input data to improve the performance of the system in detecting a slight difference between benign and malicious traffic. The CNN2D model is optimized with the help of Adam optimization algorithm with the Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss (CCEL), which allows to effectively tune the parameters and achieve faster convergence. This methodology provides a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and computation costs, which will provide strong protection of robotic and IoT systems in the current generation based on real-time."

The proposed LNA integrates a pre-stage current-reuse technique, a dual gm-boosting architecture, and a large-sized transistor design to achieve high gain, low noise figure (NF), and low power consumption. By optimizing the current-reuse technique, the transconductance is enhanced and the minimum noise figure ($\\mathrm{NF}_{\\text {min }}$) is reduced, overcoming the inherent NF degradation issue in conventional current-reuse configurations. Additionally, the introduction of large-sized transistors minimizes thermal noise from gate resistance and reduces the chip area. The output stage employs a multi-gate configuration to significantly enhance linearity. Fabricated in a $65-\\mathrm{nm}$ CMOS process, the LNA achieves a peak gain of 18.8 dB, a minimum NF of 2.3 dB, and a power consumption of 9 mW. It demonstrates exceptional performance in the $27.5-31 \\mathrm{GHz}$ satellite communication band and is well-suited for broadband satellite communication systems."

This research presents an efficient deep learning-based approach for the automated classification of coffee leaf diseases using a pre-trained ResNet50 architecture. The methodology involved preprocessing a dataset of 1,664 images categorized into four classes: miner, no disease, phoma, and rust. Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model generalization. Transfer learning with the ResNet50 backbone, pre-trained on ImageNet, was employed, with fine-tuning applied to adapt the model for multi-class classification. Evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, demonstrated the model’s strong performance, achieving over 95% training accuracy and approximately 90% validation accuracy, with near-perfect results in classifying no disease and phoma categories. Loss curves confirmed effective convergence with minimal overfitting, and the confusion matrix highlighted precise predictions across most classes. This work contributes to the advancement of automated plant disease detection, offering a scalable and accurate solution that can be deployed on resource-constrained devices for real-time monitoring. The proposed approach has the potential to support farmers in early disease detection, reduce crop loss, and promote sustainable agricultural practices."

However, automated extraction of formal relationships remains challenging due to limited annotations, evolving terminology, and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) conditions. We propose a unified framework that integrates classification and generative models using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a search controller. MCTS navigates a hybrid search tree where classification (CAL) and generation (REBEL) correspond to orthogonal expansion paths, with a learned reward model guiding which reasoning strategy to apply at each step. This unified search structure enables the framework to balance the contextual flexibility of generative expansions with the precision of classification-based inferences. A reinforcement learning–based reward model estimates the utility of candidate actions during simulation and guides value propagation throughout the MCTS tree, enabling robust extraction under low-resource and OOV conditions. Experimental results on the 5G RRC dataset show that our MCTS-based method achieves 97.2% accuracy in in-vocabulary settings and 91.2% in OOV scenarios outperforming REBEL and CAL. These results highlight the potential of reward-guided hybrid search to improve scalable, interpretable formal verification pipelines in mission-critical environments."

According to the research, there is a lot of emphasis on machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) approaches, which are used in tools like chatbots, automated feedback systems, and adaptive learning platforms. The application field is dominated by higher education, with particular emphasis on computer programming and language acquisition. Significant gaps still exist, nevertheless, such as the lack of a consensus definition for AI-assisted learning, the little investigation of multimodal integration, and the lack of focus on moral issues like algorithmic prejudice and data privacy. Furthermore, rather of using actual learning settings, the majority of research depend on simulations or small-scale setups. In order to overcome these constraints, this paper suggests an integrative architecture that combines multimodal inputs such as text, audio, and video, explainable AI (XAI) for transparency, and ethical governance. Additionally, it promotes more involvement of underrepresented fields including K–12 and vocational education as well as research into hybrid AI– human teaching methods. This paper provides a path for the moral, practical, and inclusive development of AI-assisted learning systems in addition to synthesizing existing information."

This has given rise to the need for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) capable of operating at the network edge on resource-constrained devices. The IDS must be able to detect both known and unknown threats so combining detection methods provides an efficient and scalable way to enhance security. The centralized IDS is limited, it is a single point of failure and has data privacy issues. Often sharing data between devices is not efficient or desired. Collaborative methods, such as federated learning, provide an alternative but remain susceptible to adversarial attacks, including model poisoning. Trust establishment among distributed nodes remains a challenge, motivating our design of a lightweight, blockchainbacked distributed IDS for IoT networks. Our implementation combines anomaly-based federated learning with Snort-based signature detection. We use the blockchain for immutable logging of model updates and reputation-based trust scores. Experiments with the CICIDS2017 dataset demonstrate high detection accuracy and acceptable latency for our use case. All experiments were conducted on a real-world testbed, including on Raspberry Pi and ESP32 devices."

    "abstract": "The onion routing (Tor) provides privacy and anonymity in Internet routing but adds significant latency as a trade-off. While the current Tor implementation only supports either enabling or disabling the Tor protection, previous research has designed mechanisms to more precisely control the trade-off. However, previous research rely on the Tor provision infrastructure by either having the relay peer nodes control the routing or by explicitly communicating the topological information to the source node. Both of these approaches deviate from the current Tor implementation of source-driven control (including the relay and circuit selection) and introduce additional requirements on the Tor infrastructure, thereby limiting their practicality. We advance the trade-off control between anonymity and networking latency performance by implementing learning on the source node so that it self-learns about the topology and the circuit delays without relying on the Tor infrastructure. We introduce a control parameter m to control the trade-off to achieve m-Anonymity and design two versions of the scheme based on the circuit selection (uniformly random vs. random with the consensus weight bias). Our m-Anonymity scheme using uniformly random selection achieves log<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>(m) bits of entropy, while our scheme using the consensus-weight circuit selection performs slightly less in the anonymity degree. Decreasing m yields significant latency performance improvement over Vanilla Tor. Our scheme provides a tunable solution that enables the users to control the performance and anonymity trade-off. Our experimental results based on real-world Tor measurements show that, when tuning for performance, our scheme reduces latency by up to 54.42%. When tuning for maximum anonymity, the anonymity degree matches or outperforms Vanilla Tor."

    "abstract": "Deep learning excels at deriving rich, high-dimensional features from modalities such as text, audio, and images. In network security, these methods offer a path to learn deep representations from the vast volumes of traffic that modern infrastructures carry. However, current malware-traffic analysis workflows rely on classical deep learning methods, such as convolutional or sequential architectures. While these methods are effective at capturing local byte-sequence patterns, they struggle to model dependencies that span long packet flows. Transformer models, with their use of self-attention, help address this limitation by attending globally to the input sequence. However, treating each network byte as an individual token leads to lengthy one-dimensional input sequences. In this paper, we introduce a compact, image-inspired encoding that converts contiguous byte segments into fixed patch sizes and arranges them on a two-dimensional grid. Each resulting patch functions as a single input token, dramatically reducing sequence length. Next, we leverage these packet images as input into a Vision Transformer (ViT) to efficiently attend across the entire packet. This patch-based representation preserves global context for self-attention while exploiting the ViT’s strength in modeling spatially structured inputs. Lastly, to address the limitation of retraining the model to generalize to newly introduced malware classes, we introduce few-shot learning to quickly adapt to novel classes in a data-restricted environment. On the CIC-IoT23 malware-traffic dataset, our approach achieves impressive accuracy across multiple malware families, outperforming baseline methods."

Existing research on analog circuit routing is mostly applicable only to specific circuits and follows a net-wise routing approach based on a particular net order. These methods have poor generalization and cannot guarantee full routability and global optimization. This paper proposes a region-wise routing algorithm for circuits with macro-cells of arbitrary numbers, sizes, and shapes. The algorithm can determine whether the circuit is routable during the global routing stage. A special step is inserted between global and detailed routing to classify and positioning the pins of each net based on region sorting result. During detailed routing step, optimized routing strategies is selected based on the net conditions of the regions. Therefore, the algorithm in this paper can effectively improve routing efficiency, routability and has excellent generalization."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel data-driven study of rural artisans in Karnataka by leveraging YouTube video transcripts and natural language processing (NLP) to examine how cooperative social entrepreneurship (CSE) relates to environmental practices and livelihood outcomes. CSE initiatives in India typically rely on primary surveys to understand how artisanal groups adopt eco-friendly practices and how this affects their livelihoods, but such data are costly to collect and difficult to scale. We investigate whether publicly available video narratives can serve as a scalable secondary data source for studying CSE among rural artisans. We compile a corpus of YouTube videos on banana-fibre craft, Anegundi/Hampi artisan collectives, and Karnataka handicrafts. Audio is transcribed using an automatic speech recognition pipeline, and the resulting bilingual/multilingual text (English–Hindi–Kannada) is processed with a rule-based NLP tagger to identify three constructs central to our CSE perspective: (i) artisan and community references (CSE signals), (ii) environmental practices (e.g., \"banana waste to fibre,\" \"eco-friendly,\" \"sustainable\"), and (iii) livelihood/product mentions (e.g., baskets, mats, runners) as observable proxies for livelihood outcomes. On top of this, we apply text mining techniques topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and supervised classification with fine-tuned transformer models (BERT) to classify transcript segments (e.g., environmental focus vs livelihood focus) and extract key thematic topics. Experimental results show that our BERT-based classifier achieves over 90% accuracy, substantially outperforming traditional baselines such as TF-IDF+SVM and LSTM. The videos frequently encode both CSE signals and explicit environmental practices, and a non-trivial subset articulates marketable products, suggesting that platform narratives can partially capture the CSE–environment–outcome chain without questionnaires. However, explicit statements about market, seasonality, or constraint variables remain sparse, revealing limitations of video-based secondary data. The study contributes methodologically by integrating digital media analytics into rural development research, offers complexity and performance analysis of the employed algorithms, and stresses reproducibility through transparent documentation of data sources, model architectures, training configurations, and evaluation metrics."

In order to obtain better accuracy of MEMS resonator vibration amplitude control, this paper problem of rectifier tail current mismatch in our previous work, and realizes a rectifier with low temperature coefficient output amplitude.

The design is realized by $0.35 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ BCD process.

The TD interpolation improves the resolution of each stage to achieve high power efficiency. Since dual-residue ADCs eliminate the need for an exact gain, the mismatches in the parallel operation of quantization and amplification between the sub-ADC and multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) are mitigated. Consequently, high-speed conversion is enabled without the need for gain error calibration. Furthermore, a low-power dynamically biased open-loop amplifier with high linearity is proposed. Implemented in a $\\mathbf{2 8}-\\mathrm{nm}$ CMOS process, the ADC achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 64.1 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 76.6 dB at a 684.1 MHz input frequency, yielding a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 170.5 dB."

Furthermore, integrating channel coding is imperative for enhancing error resilience under diverse fading environments. However, the joint impact of THI and channel coding on error performance in downlink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems remains unexplored. This paper investigates the impact of THI on the symbol error rate (SER) and explores the effectiveness of block codes in mitigating these impacts in RSMA systems. More precisely, a detailed analysis of the constellation-based SER is conducted for a multi-user RSMA setup, considering both transmitter and receiver hardware impairments with perfect and imperfect detection events of the common stream. Moreover, closed-form expressions for the coded average SER (ASER) are derived under both zero and non-zero THI for multi-user RSMA systems over Nakagami-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i> fading with varying shape parameters in single-input single-output (SISO) scenarios. This study also presents asymptotic ASER expressions with diversity order analysis under both zero and non-zero THI. The accuracy of these derived ASER expressions is verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the SISO analytical framework is extended to the multiple-input multiple-output scenario, with comparative evaluations against the SISO scenario to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed coded RSMA system."

However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness for bi-temporal remote sensing images (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, two remote sensing images of the same area at different times). The introduced visionguided module is a dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization.

    "abstract": "The development of Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things has not only paved the way to realize real-time intelligent tasks in vehicular edge computing systems, but also caused a series of problems such as system overload. Task offloading based on edge-terminal cooperation is one of the efficient paradigms to solve these problems. However, the dependency between the subtasks in vehicular intelligent tasks, as well as the resource shortage of terminal vehicles and edge servers, all pose serious challenges to efficient task offloading. In this paper, we investigate the optimization problem of task offloading in vehicular edge computing systems with the consideration of the above challenges, aiming to minimize the system consumption including processing delay and energy consumption, and prove it as a mixed integer nonlinear and NP-hard problem. To address this problem, we construct directed acyclic graphs to represent the complex dependency between the subtasks and utilize pipeline diagrams to calculate the task processing delay. Then, an efficient Dependency-aware and Energy efficient task offloading schedule DESR is proposed, which utilizes a cyclic iterative method to decouple the problem into sub-problems and introduces multi-layer activity on edge networks and the interior point method to jointly optimize offloading Selection and Resource allocation. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed DESR, and the results illustrate its superior performance."

This paper presents a hybrid XGBoost-CNN-LSTM model for real-time quality assessment, which synergistically integrates electronic nose data with multimodal freshness indicators-sensory scores, Aerobic Plate Count (APC), and Total Volatile Basic Nitrogen (TVB-N). The proposed architecture employs a dual-path feature fusion strategy, combining raw sensor inputs with XGBoost-optimized features to construct a discriminative hierarchical feature matrix. A CNN layer extracts local patterns from the fused features, followed by a single-layer unidirectional LSTM with 32 hidden units to capture temporal dependencies. The decoder efficiently maps final hidden states through fully connected layers to simultaneously predict sensory, microbiological (APC), and chemical (TVB-N) freshness indicators. Comparative evaluations against two baseline models (TCN and SqueezeNet) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Validated on embedded platforms (Raspberry Pi 4B and Jetson TX2 NX), the model achieves high inference speed with minimal resource consumption, establishing a practical and efficient framework for intelligent seafood quality monitoring in edge environments."

Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid open/closed-loop identification strategy incorporating nonlinear compensation for automated parameter identification. An excitation-adaptive amplitude-frequency open-loop injection scheme is proposed to safely excite unknown PMSMs while eliminating phase-measurement errors in identification, thereby enabling efficient and high-precision open-loop parameter identification. Within a single closed-loop ramp current injection procedure, simultaneous stator resistance identification and inverter nonlinearity compensation are achieved, enhancing the speed and accuracy of identification. Furthermore, skin effect compensation is implemented via analysis of mid- and high-frequency current responses to improve inductance identification precision. The framework uniquely integrates compensation for critical nonlinearities while eliminating manual intervention. Validation on a 750W PMSM confirms enhanced accuracy, operational efficiency and reliability."

    "abstract": "With the increasing number of connected devices and complex networks involved, current domain-specific authentication mechanisms become inadequate for the dynamic access demands of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Cross-domain authentication and authorization could enhance device interoperability across different security domains. However, they face new challenges including increased authentication latency, non-transferable trust, and excessive authorization computational overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose Dynamic Authentication and Granularized Authorization (DAGA), a cross-domain Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)-based framework that enables efficient, adaptive, and scalable authentication and authorization for large-scale IoT systems. Rather than relying on full authentication for every request, DAGA introduces a cross-domain pre-authentication phase that estimates device trustworthiness in advance. Specifically, DAGA leverages Federated Learning (FL) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based dynamic trust management to minimize unnecessary trust score computations, thereby accelerating cross-domain pre-authentication. At the same time, DAGA employs multi-level and cached fast authorization to achieve adaptive granularized access control, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DAGA achieves notable reductions in communication and computation overhead compared to ZTA, blockchain-based, and lightweight mechanisms, significantly reducing authentication latency. Despite its efficiency gains, DAGA achieves a superior accuracy–latency trade-off over other baseline approaches, effectively balancing security and efficiency through adaptive optimization."

In current 3D chips, network on chip is commonly employed to facilitate intercore communication. However, in 3D NoC, failures of Through-Silicon Via (TSV) links in the vertical direction can lead to communication breakdowns, necessitating targeted fault-tolerant designs. Existing approaches typically address this problem either by incorporating redundant TSV or by routing around faulty routers during path computation; the former incurs substantial hardware overhead, while the latter degrades network performance. This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant scheme that does not require redundant TSV and effectively exploits the remaining functional links in routers with TSV failures. The proposed method introduces a mere 6.9% area overhead, yet maintains 99.3% of the pre-failure TSV network performance, demonstrating negligible performance loss."

    "abstract": "Conventional charge-pump phase-locked loops (CPPLLs) suffer from inherent trade-offs between dead-zone elimination, linear detection range, and current mismatch in the design of the phase frequency detector (PFD) and charge pump (CP). To address these issues, this paper presents a novel PFD architecture incorporating a 4-bit digitally-programmable delay cell, offering 16 programmable delay steps to eliminate dead-zone effects while extending the linear phase detection range to $(-1.967 \\pi, 1.967 \\pi)$. The proposed CP employs a source-switched single-ended topology with an embedded rail-to-rail operational amplifier and a 4-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), achieving a current mismatch below 0.2% across the full 0.04 V to $V_{D D}(1 \\mathrm{~V})$ output range while maintaining stable voltage regulation. Postlayout simulation results demonstrate a peak power consumption of $729.33 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$ and a phase noise of $-136.63 \\mathrm{dBc} / \\mathrm{Hz}$ at 1 MHz frequency offset. Moreover, the design is implemented in a 28 nm CMOS process and occupies an area of $0.0195 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$."

    "abstract": "In the age of using technology to work together remotely, the inability to share files in a secure manner is a problem often faced since many online sharing options available do not have good protection on their sharing options and do not safeguard against unauthorized use of the files. This paper presents a secure file sharing portal that has end to end encryption and user-based access controls and that works inside a web browser. The system uses the Web Crypto API interface to provide local encryption on the user’s devices using the AES-GCM encryption algorithm, so that the user’s plaintext documents do not leave the device. A separate layer of protection exists in the system. It is not enough for a user to just receive the encrypted file. The user has to receive a decryption key that the sender has to share through a separate channel. Access is for members only which requires sender approval and we have features like secure QR code share, session monitoring, digital certificates for identity proof and policy enforcement for compliance. Also, we have a \"Secure Space\" module which is for ephemeral work groups that has in space chat, multi user invites, controlled key exchange and one click revocation which in turn puts power back in the users’ hands. We combined zero knowledge structure with audit able workflows to present a privacy first, scalable and easy to use solution. Also, we show how we used modern web tech to create a trusted setting for sensitive file share which at the same time does not sacrifice ease of use or performance."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices has improved day-to-day automation, but at the cost of increased exploitation due to unaddressed security concerns. Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is a physical layer security approach designed to address IoT security concerns by exploiting unintentional defects and distortions imparted to the signal by the IoT device’s radio frequency front-end. Despite significant research, SEI still faces barriers limiting its practical implementation. One barrier is cross-collection SEI, which occurs when an SEI process is trained to identify emitters using a single set of collected signals and then used to identify those identical emitters using signals collected hours, days, or even long after the initial training signals. This requires learning of collection-agnostic emitter-specific features. With this in mind, cross-collection SEI is investigated while considering the impacts of antenna characteristics and frequency band. The results show that cross-collection SEI performance is higher when the emitters operate in higher frequency bands using high-gain antennas. This is attributed to the antenna’s amplification of emitter-specific features and increased stress on the RF front-end due to the higher operating frequency."

However, limited analysis in multipath environments, the complexity of the optimization problem, and beam squint effects due to the array’s frequency dependent characteristics motivate the need for an improved code design. Furthermore, if an eavesdropper knew the \"optimal\" code matrix, they could undermine the PLS of the system. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a new channel model for multipath environments for this system along with the use of Symbol-Level Precoding (SLP) to achieve PLS in the multipath channel for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) space-time modulated MTM antenna array system. The system framework presented also accounts for beam squint effects. Finally, the use of randomized code sequences is discussed and simulation results are presented to verify the proposed design."

This paper presents a novel method for sensing incumbent radar waveforms by leveraging the Sounding Reference Signal (SRS) in cellular networks, which is used for uplink channel estimation in 5G systems. The proposed approach was evaluated through MATLAB simulations and a testbench implementation utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs) and the OpenAirInterface (OAI) software stack. Experimental results demonstrate radar detection using SRS measurements under sufficient radar power. One caveat is that detection relies on the overlap between radar pulses and SRS symbols, which may not always occur. Nevertheless, the method introduces minimal overhead and provides a rapid, cost-effective situational awareness layer that complements more advanced sensing techniques."

    "abstract": "A crucial part of developing smart cities is preventing traffic accidents in smart towns. However, it is still difficult to forecast and identify traffic accidents since road networks are complicated and constantly changing, especially at big crossings. To better manage these ever-changing circumstances, this proposed need reaction and monitoring technologies that can boost safety while reducing congestion in real-time. Urban infrastructure that incorporates intelligent accident detection and prediction technologies can greatly enhance road safety and overall living conditions. In order to clean the dataset and extract deeper insights, this study applies data reduction techniques and encodes high-frequency categorical features. It then uses computer vision to analyse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. Hybrid deep learning models that combine CNN and LSTM networks are suggested as a solution to the shortcomings of conventional machine learning approaches. This model is great for accident prediction since it uses CNNs to extract spatial features and LSTMs to deal with temporal dependencies. The CNN-LSTM model outperformed previous methods with an accuracy of 96.45% on a benchmark dataset. These findings show that deep learning has the ability to make urban transport networks safer and smarter by allowing for accurate accident prevention systems to operate in real-time."

Services managing these networks must resource-efficiently maintain understanding and awareness of available resources to execute these applications. They must then make complex decisions on how and where to execute these applications. With poor understanding of the available resources, this problem is even more difficult and the performance of the system might be suboptimal.

The proposed design provides the dual-input high-gain expandable switched-capacitor-inductor cell (DIHGESCIC) converter for advanced power conversion applications using the switched-capacitor (SC) and switched-inductor (SI) techniques to obtain a higher voltage gain. The operating principle of the switched-capacitor-switched-inductor cell is to discharge in series and charge parallelly. The proposed topology produces high gain with comparatively low electrical stress on semiconductors and low current or voltage ripples. It provides common grounding, continuous input current, and allows for increased higher voltage gain by expansion in the proposed structure. Also, the expansion in analogous SC and SI cells do not impact on order of transfer function, which reduces the controller design and tuning complexity. A comprehensive analysis of the operational modes, along with all relevant calculations, is conducted under steady state and continuous conduction mode (CCM). This paper includes state-space analysis, PI based voltage controller design, and comparative analysis.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing, yet their ability to perform complex logical reasoning remains limited. Existing approaches such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) provide partial improvements but often suffer from prompt sensitivity, semantic compression, or additional computational cost. In this work, we propose a Residual Feature Enhancement (RFE) module, a lightweight architectural component designed to strengthen reasoning ability while maintaining computational efficiency. RFE integrates a dimension-preserving linear transformation, SwiGLU nonlinear activation, and residual connections to enrich attention outputs without altering the backbone structure. We conducted comprehensive experiments across six reasoning and comprehension benchmarks—LogiQA, ReClor, LogiQA2.0, GSM8K, HellaSwag, and MBPP—covering deductive reasoning, standardized test comprehension, commonsense inference, and program synthesis. Results demonstrate that ChatGLM4-9B augmented with RFE consistently achieves superior performance compared with both adapter-based methods and larger-scale baselines. Specifically, ChatGLM4-9B+RFE attains 68.20% on LogiQA, 82.00% on ReClor, 79.74% on LogiQA 2.0, 95.68% on GSM8K, 72.42% on HellaSwag, and 56.82% on MBPP, all of which surpass the Adapter mechanism (67.68%, 81.15%, 78.52%, 94.47%, 66.85%, 55.02%) and show clear advantages over open-source baselines such as Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, Llama3.1-8B, and DeepSeek distilled models. Ablation studies further confirm that removing RFE leads to performance degradation of up to 3.84 percentage points, and convergence analysis shows improved stability and faster training."

    "abstract": "In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images, video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Extensive simulations on inverted cart-pole systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 98.95% reduction in communication cost, a normalized prediction error of 0.004, and 74.48% control accuracy, outperforming conventional control baselines. Furthermore, the proposed framework maintains robust control performance on 15-step prediction horizons and supports up to 16× more devices than round-robin and opportunistic scheduling schemes with conventional control baselines under similar network conditions."

This article presents a Bluetooth Angle-of-Arrival (AOA)–assisted spatiotemporal multipath suppression framework for acoustic TOA estimation. First, a soft conic geometric prior is constructed from AOA, and the associated angular uncertainty is mapped to the distance–time domain to enable temporal gating that preserves the direct-path component while suppressing late reverberation. Second, a Gaussian-mixture intensity prior is established using the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). By inverting the Log-Distance Path Loss (LDPL) model with variance propagation, a distance–time distribution is derived and intersected with the AOA reachability bound to form a Bayesian Geometric TOA window (BG-TOA), followed by soft gating to attenuate outlier paths. Finally, under BG-TOA constraints, the joint covariance is updated online and eigenvector-based spatial filtering is performed to enhance the direct path and suppress multipath clusters, yielding the earliest consistent TOA estimate. Field experiments in an office and a large indoor space achieve mean static and dynamic localization errors of 0.11 m and 0.13 m, respectively, substantially outperforming single-sensor baselines and conventional fusion methods. The proposed framework is fully compatible with existing smartphone hardware, offering low cost and deployment simplicity."

We commence with the reuse of pilots and reference signals that exploit existing 5G NR structures for sensing. Then, we extend to more advanced approaches that integrate the data payload through novel constellation shaping, modulation bases, and pulse shaping filters. We highlight the opportunities and tradeoffs that arise when extending sensing from sparse pilot and reference signal resources to the full communication frame, emphasizing how constellation properties and modulation choices directly determine sensing performance. To illustrate practical feasibility, a case study on sensing-assisted NR Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks demonstrates how exploiting both reference signals and payload echoes can reduce signaling overhead and enable proactive beam management and handover."

Recent mainstream IRSTD methods predominantly emphasize feature extraction in the spatial domain but often neglect crucial complementary information contained in the frequency domain, resulting in limited detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Frequency-Spatial Fusion Network (FSFNet), which explicitly integrates spatial-domain features and frequency-domain information through two innovative modules: the Frequency-Spatial Block (FSBlock) and the Frequency-Spatial Feature Fusion Module (FSFFM). Specifically, the FSBlock, equipped with a Spectral Band Gate (SBG) module, selectively emphasizes informative spectral bands to capture global contextual patterns and periodic characteristics in the frequency domain, thereby complementing traditional spatial-domain local representations and enhancing the network’s ability to distinguish small targets from cluttered backgrounds. Furthermore, the FSFFM adaptively combines these multi-domain features via a frequency-guided cross-channel attention mechanism, effectively bridging the semantic gap between the spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experimental evaluations on three publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FSFNet consistently achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods."

Traditional ANN-based approaches often exhibit limited enforcement of physical monotonicity and symmetry, suffer from poor generalization, and require complex manual data preprocessing. The proposed method addresses these challenges through two core innovations: a self-adaptive data preprocessing strategy that eliminates manual intervention, and a weight-generation neural architecture that embeds physics-inspired constraints to ensure monotonicity and symmetry. Extensive device- and circuit-level evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. On average, a 3.2× reduction in mean relative error (MRE) is achieved in modeling I-V and C-V characteristics across the devices evaluated in this work compared with ANN-based models. In circuit-level simulations, the method reduces the power-delay product (PDP) error from 50% to 7% in a 17-stage ring oscillator and lowers the gain error from 5.7% to 0.4% in a common-source amplifier. Additionally, transient simulation time is reduced by up to 70% compared to ANN-based models. These results highlight that the proposed method not only improves physical consistency and modeling accuracy but also enables scalable and efficient SPICE-level simulation, paving the way for practical AI/ML-assisted compact model development."

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) in remote sensing imagery faces two critical challenges compared to general methods trained on large datasets: (1) Only a few labeled instances leveraged as the training set significantly limit the feature representation learning of deep neural networks; (2) Remote sensing image data contains complicated background and multiple objects with greatly different sizes in the same image, which leads the detector to large numbers of false alarms and miss detections. This paper proposes a FSOD framework (called DeCL-Det) that applies self-training to generate high-quality pseudo-annotations from unlabeled target domain data. These refined pseudo-labels are iteratively integrated into the training set to expand supervision for novel classes. An auxiliary network is introduced to mitigate label noise by rectifying misclassifications in pseudo-labeled regions, ensuring robust learning. For multi-scale feature learning, we propose a gradient-decoupled framework, GCFPN, combining Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) with a Gradient Decoupled Layer (GDL). FPN is to extract multi-scale feature representations, and GDL is to decouple the modules between the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and RCNN head into two stages or tasks through gradients. The two modules, FPN and GDL, train Faster R-CNN in a decoupled way to facilitate the multi-scale feature learning of novel objects. To further enhance the classification ability, we introduce a supervised contrastive learning head to enhance feature discrimination, reinforcing robustness in few-shot object detection. Experiments on the DIOR dataset indicate that our method performs better than several existing approaches and achieves competitive results."

This complex and dynamic problem requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to evolving warfare environment.

Unlike the static version, which assumes complete knowledge of future threats, the dynamic NADP problem requires continuous updates and real-time adjustments to decisions as new threats emerge and situational parameters change. We present modifications in the mathematical formulation, which is based on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, alongside a comprehensive simulation structure. We employ heuristic solution approaches that utilize a combination of a genetic algorithm, construction of an engagement graph to solve the shortest path problem, and dynamic programming (DP) techniques. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in addressing the dynamic NADP problem. The study also explores machine learning models for threat prioritization, offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by dynamic naval air defense scenarios."

    "abstract": "Timely detection of sliding bearing oil-film faults is critical for preventing costly failures and ensuring equipment reliability. Yet, diagnosis accuracy is often hindered by data scarcity and severe class imbalance in industrial environments. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a physics-informed generative framework that couples sliding bearing mechanics with data-driven modeling. The Reynolds equation is embedded into a physics-informed neural network to generate physically consistent samples for data augmentation, while a self-attention–enhanced convolutional neural network is employed to extract features from three-dimensional oil-film pressure distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate physics-informed generative modeling with self-attention mechanisms for sliding bearing fault diagnosis. Comparative experiments against conventional finite difference and other imbalanced approaches demonstrate that the proposed method not only solves the oil-film pressure field with higher efficiency but also improves fault classification accuracy on imbalanced datasets by up to 37.5%, thereby offering a new paradigm for robust diagnosis under limited data conditions."

    "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multifaceted, heterogeneous condition marked by constant fatigue and multisystem dysfunction. Identifying ME/CFS patients quickly and reliably based on clinical and patient-reported data is critical to advancing care as well as research. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex condition that often goes unrecognized in studies. It is marked by fatigue that lasts longer than expected, cognitive issues, and malaise after exertion. Due to the significant overlap of symptoms with other medical conditions and a lack of clear biomarkers, ME/CFS is hard to detect through standard clinical methods. This study outlines a machine-learning framework for identifying ME/CFS early by using publicly available physiological and biological datasets, including data from wearable devices and features from omics. To improve interpretability and efficiency, we used model feature selection methods such as ANOVA, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and impurity-based scores. We measured the classification accuracy of three supervised learning algorithms: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine classification. We utilized standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Among all the models examined, XGBoost was the most accurate, showing a strong ability to find complex, non-linear patterns in biomedical data. The results suggest that AI-based methods could help diagnose ME/CFS more quickly and provide a foundation for scalable, data-driven healthcare solutions."

    "abstract": "The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be processed into consumer-ready information objects and made available to consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database and return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) sized for edge devices to perform NLP, as well as a graph database. These types of databases are well suited for the dynamic, connected networks pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluated several medium-sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing publicly available data from the US Army’s Multi-purpose Sensing Area Multi-Purpose Sensing Area (MSA) at the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion parameters) outperforms the other models across all considered metrics. Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4% increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the groundwork for deploying LLMs on edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing information objects for critical decision making."

Deep Learning models are the most promising models to make accurate predictions. This paper intends to propose a rainfall-based flood prediction model with the following steps: a min-max normalization method in the preprocessing step, and an improved squeezeNet technique for accurate flood prediction. The standard squeezeNet model includes a limited number of layers and filters, which is not suitable for learning complex patterns and for accurate flood prediction.

The non-touch-sensing stage employs a compact 5-TFT 1-capacitor schematic. A key advantage of this design is its ability to maintain continuous clock signals throughout both touch-sensing and display intervals, thereby significantly simplifying the external clock generation circuit. The gate driver circuit is thoroughly verified based on amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs using SPICE simulation tools, confirming reliable voltage bootstrapping operation even during touch-sensing intervals exceeding $400 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$.

We explore how preserving the Gaussianity of transmit signals enhances Low Probability of Intercept and Detection (LPID) features using a data-driven autoencoder in THz band communication systems. By analyzing the probability distribution function (PDF) of THz band transmit signals, we evaluate their impact on LPID performance. Given the high sensitivity of THz systems to Phase Noise (PN) and the In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) imbalance impairments, we illustrate the importance of maintaining Gaussianity under varying PN conditions to ensure reliable and secure LPID transmission. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that PN does not compromise the Gaussianity of autoencoder-based THz band transmit signals. These results highlight the robustness of Gaussianity preservation, offering critical insights for designing THz band autoencoder-based LPID networks resilient to eavesdropping, jamming, and unauthorized interception. Our proposed autoencoder framework not only enhances LPID but also mitigates PN and IQ imbalance impairments, paving the way for secure, efficient, and reliable communication in next-generation THz networks."

The main issues that impact the battery life and reliability of the vehicles are overheating and bad usage of energy. The presented paper outlines an EV battery solar-powered thermal management system based on the IoT with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and smart control. The system uses a solar panel to extract useful renewable energy without wastage and the MPPT algorithm optimizes power output during different sunlight conditions. A microcontroller (Atmega328) constantly measures temperature and voltage of the battery. A cooling fan powered by a relay is turned on when the temperature is too high according to a set of pre-established limits and a buzzer notifies the user. Smoke detection sensor also contributes to the safety of the area by turning the motors off automatically in unsafe situations. An LCD displays all problematic parameters, such as battery voltage, temperature, solar voltage, and system status and sends them in real-time to an IoT cloud platform where it can be monitored and controlled remotely. It has been experimentally shown that the combination of solar power and intelligent thermal management can enhance the reliability of the battery, safety of the operation, and efficiency of power consumption.

A leading realization of this paradigm is Wi-Fi sensing, now being standardized in IEEE 802.11bf, which expands Wi-Fi’s role into environmental awareness. Wi-Fi sensing can support diverse applications, from smart homes to healthcare, and is highly relevant for military and security use, enabling intrusion detection, silent perimeter monitoring, and situational awareness, without dedicated radar infrastructure. However, like conventional IEEE 802.11 networks, 802.11bf sensing is prone to delays and losses from contention-based access, interference, collisions, and congestion. These issues can significantly degrade sensing, which relies on consistently timed and complete measurements.This paper presents an extension of the open-source ISAC-Physical Layer Model (PLM) framework to enable the evaluation of Wi-Fi sensing under lossy and irregular timing. In an indoor military surveillance scenario, results show that velocity accuracy significantly degrades with the packet loss and timing irregularities. These findings highlight the need for resilient sensing algorithms and robust, reproducible testing environments, both of which being supported by our proposed platform."

    "abstract": "This paper studies spectrum map recovery with distributed spectrum sensors by exploiting frequency and spatial correlation to reconstruct a more refined spectrum map at each sensor location. Hidden Markov models (HMM) are proposed to model the spectrum sensing output at each sensor to capture the frequency correlation; spatial correlation is captured by coupling the hidden states across different HMMs. As a result, spectrum map recovery is reduced to simultaneous state estimation for a collection of HMMs of equal length, where the states exhibit horizontal correlations across the HMMs. Maximum-entropy formulation is employed to estimate the joint distribution of multiple HMM output sequences. Subsequently, the forward-backward algorithm is implemented to infer the hidden states. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach in constructing a more refined spectrum map compared with approaches that do not account for frequency and spatial correlations."

Most of the existing work uses either a clustering method or an analytical way to merge multiple single-bit flip-flops (SBFFs) into MBFFs. In this paper, inspired by the recent success in deep reinforcement learning, we propose a novel MBFF merging method leveraging neural network. The approach can be divided into two steps: (i) placing MBFFs by a pretrained RL agent, and (ii) mapping the pin pairs of the original SBFF to the MBFF cell. Experimental results show that our method can significantly save power and area, without large perturbations to the timing."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially multi-UAV groups, have a variety of applications, making them a focus of growing research interest. With estimates saying that millions of UAVs will take to the skies in the near future, coordinated adaptive planning has become a critical element in completion and correctness of mission execution. Effective collaborative decision-making requires seamless communication among agents, which introduces a variety of challenges. In this work, we have focused on addressing the problem of maintaining coordination while performing missions when communication range is limited. UAVs are often expected to be able to perform in remote, infrastructure-less locations while maintaining communication. In a large domain, as the agents spread out, this may become difficult, leading to a breakdown in collaboration and end in mission failure. To address this, we propose a configurable framework that enables agents to adaptively plan their trajectories and rely on fallback strategies when communication becomes infeasible. Using Plume Wrapping as an exemplar, we have proposed two algorithms – AeroSweep and AeroBeam – which allow the platoon to use alternate options like limiting interUAV distance or following a clock-based synchronization strategy in order to continue the mission. The goal of our work is to demonstrate that our framework can not only complete the task successfully, but can also be tuned to produce required coverage within acceptable cost bounds based on mission specifications and domain knowledge."

    "abstract": "The majority of the university graduates leave their courses with high grades, but they usually do not have the necessary skills needed in the working environments including teamwork, problem-solving and digital skills. This disconnect between higher education training and the needs of the industry is what is referred to as the graduate skills gap. The article consists of a literature review from 2020-2025 to explore how learner-centred pedagogy can be used to reduce this gap. The results have shown that project-based learning, real-life assessment, internship and micro-credential equip students better than conventional exams. Employers prefer technical and soft skills to academic performance, but most universities are facing problems with stiff curricula and lack of faculty training. This review proposes the incorporation of practice projects, industry partnership, and online skill records to fill the gap. These are some of the strategies that can be used to equip the students with the competencies needed in the current dynamically changing labour market."

In this paper, we recommend a hybrid system consisting of machine learning (ML), data processing, and a React-based web interface, to provide smart and personalized predictions for anime recommendations. The proposed system collects user data from previous viewing histories , and previously assigned ratings and genre preferences and then applies ML models to identify trends in user behavior and ultimately create a model to estimate the user’s model. The backend uses content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to generate scores of similarity between users and anime, and ultimately generate recommendations for each user. The front end, built in React, provides an interactive and responsive interface for users to explore, rate, and receive recommendations in real time. The model also incorporates continuous feedback to make accurate predictions in real time. This research contributes to the field by (1) applying ML algorithms to personalize anime recommendations from user behavior and content similarity, (2) offering a responsive React interface for interaction in real-time, and (3) showcasing an adaptive environment for recommendations that improve user draw in digital entertainment. Our model demonstrates the opportunity for efficiency, scalability, and design in machine learning in conjunction with upgraded web construction technology to generate user-centered recommendation systems."

Accurate prediction of SST is essential for understanding climate variability, supporting ecological assessments, and informing human-related decision-making in coastal and oceanic regions. Although traditional data-driven prediction models can capture the spatiotemporal features of sea surface temperature, they often violate ocean dynamic principles by neglecting underlying physical laws. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Physics-Guided ConvLSTM (PGConvLSTM) model that integrates physical constraints with Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and ConvLSTM, which enhances prediction accuracy and physical consistency by incorporating the ocean density equation constraints into the loss function. Experimental results show that, compared to the baseline ConvLSTM model, PG-ConvLSTM achieves: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.2 \\%-8.7 \\%$</tex> reduction in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for 12-month global SST forecasts, 12.3% decrease in density deviation. The predictions generated by the proposed model better adhere to physical laws, such as ocean density stratification.

    "abstract": "Massive growth of the Chinese carbon-credit market has been characterized by endemic data obscurity, certification latency, and fraud, specifically in the Passenger Cars Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credit Regulation (PCFN) scheme in the automotive industry. Its present centralized management system is not transparent and has information asymmetries and is very prone to manipulation results in erroneous carbon-credit determination, inefficient dealings, and the deteriorating stakeholder confidence. This paper offers a federated blockchain-IoT information infrastructure to deal with these severe inadequacies, namely, the provision of end-to-end transparency, tamper-resistance, and autonomous functionality in managing carbon-credit. The framework uses radio frequency identification (RFID) to capture real-time emission data, delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus to provide scalable verification and uses smart contracts to provide a decentralized credit assessment and trading. Besides, an AI-based predictive analytics control is incorporated to dynamically predict credit prices and identify anomalies on distributed nodes. Experimental comparison with national automotive carbon datasets reveals that the 72.6% latency of credit verification is reduced, the 38.2% transparency of audit is increased, and the 93.5% accuracy of fraud detection is achieved rather significantly in comparison to the traditional centralized model. The suggested framework will offer a platform on which the cross-sector carbon-credit markets of China can be scaled and verified to speed up the process of the country achieving its carbon neutrality targets of 3060."

    "abstract": "Retinal microsurgery demands precise force regulation due to the extreme delicacy of intraocular tissues and the absence of natural tactile feedback. This study introduces an Adaptive Interventional Robotic System (AIRS) incorporating a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for predictive control of scleral interaction forces. The developed system integrates high-frequency Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) force sensing with a real-time adaptive admittance controller to prevent unsafe tool-tissue contact during surgical procedures. Experiments were conducted on a retinal phantom model that simulates scleral biomechanics, where the FBG sensors continuously captured orthogonal force components and insertion depth. The TCN processes multivariate temporal sequences to forecast near-future force values and dynamically adjust control parameters, enabling predictive stabilization. Comparative evaluation against stacked and single Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks demonstrated the superior learning and response performance of the AIRS-TCN framework. The model achieved a Coefficient of Determination (R2) of 0.987, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0016, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.029, F1-Score of 95.6% and an average Prediction Time of 8 ms. These results confirm the TCN’s ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining real-time inference capability. The agreement between predicted and measured forces highlights the model’s robustness, stability and clinical potential for ensuring safe, compliant and precise motion behavior in robot-assisted retinal microsurgery."

In this paper, it is stated that the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) and incident response plans can be interlinked to assist in enhancing cybersecurity, along with the IT service desk efficiency. We examine the application of AI: to automate threat detection and response through automation of SIEM in the form of AI-driven SIEM automation, to attack real-time Security Monitoring with SIEM tools and as one of the key dimensions of ensuring the enhancement of the access control via Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). In addition, the paper also explains the role that a joint incident response mechanism has in alleviating the effects of breaches and enhancing the organizational resilience of large organizations. Implementing these technologies will allow institutions to achieve more precise detection and faster response times, and less overhead, which will eventually lead to more investment in cybersecurity and IT support systems.

    "abstract": "In the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) spectrum’s opportunistic spectrum access, the General Authorized Access (GAA) and the auctioned primary access license users experience unstable spectrum availability concerning the uninformed incumbent movements in a targeted service region. Such unstable CBRS spectrum availability manifests in frequent grant suspensions and sporadic authorizations of the requesting non-incumbent devices, controlled by a centralized cloud administrator known as the spectrum access system, restraining the non-incumbent devices from providing time-critical services to the end users. Utilizing measured information communication logs from an installed GAA CBRS Device (CBSD), that record State Transitions (STs), in this paper, we evaluate the potential of a few state-of-the-art machine learning models to forecast CBRS spectrum availability from a non-incumbent user’s perspective near an incumbent-dominated region of San Diego County. Specifically, we model the CBSD STs as a marked temporal point process, a framework for modeling temporal event sequences. Our one-step-ahead prediction experiments reveal that while high accuracy (⩾90%) can be achieved in predicting the next CBSD state, accurately estimating the timing of the next ST remains challenging (e.g., mean absolute error ⩾0.2 hours and root mean squared error ⩾ 2.8 hours) due to the unpredictable nature of incumbent activities."

But, satisfying the changing, data-intensive expectations of contemporary organisations can be a struggle for classic ERP systems. As a strategic approach to improve operational intelligence and business process automation, integrating Artificial Intelligence into ERP systems has arisen to solve these limitations. The research presented here uses preprocessing and standardisation to prepare Big Data, and then it uses PCA and ICA to extract features. In order to increase classification performance, the research presents a new architecture for transfer learning that combines the Rapid Wavelet Transform and the Separator Wavelet Network. This design replaces the traditional Support Vector Machine and AlexNet models. Furthermore, in order to simplify categorisation and improve intelligent detection, a fuzzy DSS is created using fuzzy logic. While the DSS-CNN model obtains an amazing accuracy of 98.02%, experimental evaluations show that the suggested SWN-based classifier produces improved classification rates and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the fact that ERP adaptability, decision-making, and overall organisational effectiveness are greatly enhanced by AI-driven automation and operational intelligence."

This research proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework for the automated classification of fractures using a hybrid architecture of MobileNetV3-Small and specifically designed new convolutional layers. The framework was trained and validated on the Fracture Multi-Region X-ray dataset, a publicly available dataset containing 10,580 grayscale X-ray images labelled from different anatomically connected regions (bones of limbs, spine, hips, knees). To improve diagnostic accuracy and freedoms, we implemented transfer learning, data preprocessing, a comprehensive and internal augmentation pipeline (including flipping, rotation, contrast, and zoom), etc. MobileNetV3-Small was used as a lightweight feature extractor and further optimized with our convolutional blocks, batch normalization, dropout, and global average pooling. Our training strategy included two separate phases, where the first phase aimed to solely extract the features, with the second phase featuring feature extraction and then fine-tuning, while optimization was executed using AdamW with a fully adaptive learning schedule. Evaluation performance on the test set resulted in isolated classification accuracy of 97%, and was candidates set against DenseNet121, VGG-16, and ResNet50. The findings validate the effectiveness of using lightweight architectures enhanced with domain-specific features for precise medical image analysis. Due to its computational efficiency, the model is suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications, such as point-of-care and mobile health systems. This work establishes a foundation for future improvement through transformer-based architectures, multimodal data types, and explainable AI to facilitate diagnostic confidence and opportunities for clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However, fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E, Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery time."

In this work, a holistic approach is demonstrated to eliminate the back-gating effects in the GaN-on-Si BDS without using the active substrate control. Different from the conventional single-channel design, the proposed device features two closely coupled 2DEG channels in between there exists a hole-storage/spreading channel. With a synchronized photonic-electronic driving (SPED) scheme, in the on-state, electron-hole pairs (EHPs) are generated in the source-to-gate and gate-to-drain access regions by photons with an above-bandgap energy of ~3.65 eV from an off-chip photon source. The EHPs are separated by the vertical electric field, with the holes in the upper channel subsequently blocked by the thin inserted AlN barrier layer in the double-channel structure and spreading along the hole-storage/spreading channel to the gated region, providing effective shielding to the upper channel and inducing electrons in the lower channel to compensate for reduced 2DEG density. As a result, the double-channel BDS (DC-BDS) is free of back-gating effects."

    "abstract": "Aphasia is a common condition following brain injury, traditionally assessed and treated by speech therapists through manual evaluations and conventional language rehabilitation. However, these methods are time-consuming, reliant on professionals, and subject to subjective biases. This study aims to develop a virtual speech therapy room with an automated assessment model to assist clinicians in evaluation. It provides immersive virtual reality (VR) language training modules, combining analysis of physiological data to achieve the goal of smart healthcare. Twenty individuals with aphasia (IWA) and ten healthy participants were involved, with aphasia subjects randomly assigned to the experimental and control group A, and healthy participants forming control group B. Clinical scales, VR tasks, and neurobehavioral data were measured as needed. Statistical analysis confirmed that using virtual reality can enhance the effectiveness of aphasia treatment interventions. Utilizing virtual reality and behavioral sensing technology, significant differences were observed in the left frontal and occipital regions between IWA and healthy participants, aligning with clinical observations of impaired language and visual processing areas. The assessment model, established through these data, achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% in distinguishing between individuals with aphasia and healthy participants using multimodal fusion with repeated cross-validation, indicating its potential as an auxiliary tool for physician assessment and treatment."

    "abstract": "The measurement of dynamic forces within spacecraft sources is critical for safeguarding mission accuracy and stable operation. Two major challenges impede accurate measurement of dynamic forces from large sources: the severe nonlinearity of platforms; leading to inaccuracies in traditional methods; and the explosion of redundant sensor combinations, lowering optimization efficiency. To address these issues, this article proposes an intelligent framework that synergistically integrates the genetic algorithm with adaptive-learning-rate-based back propagation (GAARBP) and Bayesian optimization (BO). The GAARBP module addresses the nonlinear input-output mapping problem of the platform, and enhances the efficiency and accuracy of model training through adaptive learning rate adjustment. The BO module employs a blockwise Matérn kernel function tailored for sensors on horizontal and vertical planes to construct a Gaussian process surrogate model, alongside an expected improvement-based acquisition function for efficient optimization. These two modules operate in a closed loop, wherein GAARBP provides accurate fitting errors to guide BO’s selection, and BO feeds back optimal sensors to enhance GAARBP’s model training. Experimental results show that the framework achieves higher measurement accuracy (error: 2.28%) and superior decoupling performance (error: 1.13%), sufficient to satisfy the measurement requirements of large vibration sources in spacecraft. Moreover, compared with conventional methods (exhaustive search, D-optimization, particle swarm optimization, etc.), the proposed framework selects the best sensor combination more effectively for the optimization problem of six sensors selected from 24, with outcomes that are virtually globally optimal. This article offers a novel, effective approach to synergistically solving nonlinear dynamic force measurement and sensor optimization in complex environments. It thereby promotes the intelligent advancement of testing technologies in these fields."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, protecting the intellectual property (IP) of models in FL, particularly against model theft by malicious clients, remains a critical challenge. Existing works often employ watermarking techniques to embed watermarks into models for ownership verification, but most of them can only verify ownership after the model has been stolen and cannot proactively defend against malicious clients attempting to steal the model. To address this limitation, this paper proposes FedLock, a novel server-side watermarking mechanism designed to resist model theft and safeguard the IP of global models. Specifically, FedLock leverages Split Federated Learning (SFL) to partition the model, effectively preventing malicious clients from accessing the complete set of global model parameters. To enhance security, FedLock incorporates an autoencoder for label encoding, safeguarding the server-side model from reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, FedLock introduces an additional backdoor client to embed a black-box watermark into the global model, enabling remote verification of model ownership. Experimental results demonstrate that FedLock achieves robust watermarking with minimal impact on model performance, effectively resisting various attacks, including model theft, pruning, and fine-tuning."

For performance comparisons, we utilize the SpaceNet2 dataset as well as a dataset from an area in Lahore, Pakistan that captures closely connected buildings. The proposed methodology is found to perform consistently across various spatial regions and outperforms benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "The low-rank tensor constraint is widely used in multiview subspace clustering (MSC) and has demonstrated promising clustering performance on many datasets. The key challenges in most existing low-rank tensor constraint-based methods include: 1) the choice of surrogate functions for the tensor rank and 2) the rotation operation applied to the tensor formed by stacking multiple subspace representations along the third mode. The latter plays a critical role in enhancing clustering performance in multiview settings. In this work, we rethink the low-rank tensor constraint and present the enhanced residual tensor norm (ERTN) for multiview subspace clustering, dubbed ERTN-MSC. To be specific, ERTN employs a novel surrogate for the tensor rank, based on the residual learning of singular values, which facilitates better exploitation of the structural information in multiview data. Furthermore, ERTN applies the tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) on three modes of the tensor constructed by multiple subspaces, which generalizes the rotation operation of tensor and enables comprehensive exploration of both intraview information and interview information of multiview data. An augmented Lagrangian multiplier-based algorithm with a convergence guarantee is designed for optimization. Experiments conducted on several real-world multiview datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our ERTN-MSC."

To address this gap, this article proposes a comprehensive HCAI methodological framework (HCAI-MF) comprising five key components: HCAI requirement hierarchy, approach and method taxonomy, process, interdisciplinary collaboration approach, and multilevel design paradigms. A case study demonstrates HCAI-MF’s practical implications, while the article also analyzes implementation challenges. Actionable recommendations and a “three-layer” HCAI implementation strategy are provided to address these challenges and guide future evolution of HCAI-MF. HCAI-MF is presented as a systematic and executable methodology capable of overcoming current gaps, enabling effective design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems, and advancing HCAI practice."

This paper presents a new coarse-fine inverted span-scale positioning stage with antagonistic piezo-actuation configuration. Different from conventional designs for coarse-fine positioning stages, in the proposed stage, the coarse stage is mounted on the moving platform of the fine stage. This coarse-fine inverted configuration helps to utilize the high out-of-plane stiffness of the fine stage and to guarantee the workspace of the overall system. To address the measurement signal allocation and chattering problems in antagonistic actuation, a Sigmoid function is used instead of the common Step function. A prototype is fabricated and its positioning and tracking performances are assessed. Experimental results show that the stage achieves a positioning error of ±25 nm and a resolution of 8 nm across a centimeter scale stroke, showing excellent span-scale positioning performance. Further, different trajectories are used to assess the tracking performance. It is found that the root-mean-square tracking error can be reduced to several tens of nanometers, corresponding to a tracking error within 1% of the trajectory span. These results demonstrate the applicability of the stage in span-scale tasks, such as single-molecule manipulation."

    "abstract": "Multi-vehicle–UAV collaborative inspection systems face critical challenges in complex environments, where spatiotemporal node conflicts, coupled scheduling, and congestion severely affect operational efficiency. To address these issues, we define the Multi-UAV–Multi-Vehicle Collaborative Inspection Vehicle Routing Problem in a Bi-Layer Road Network (MUMV-CIVRP-BLRN). The model captures realistic inspection scenarios through (i) spatiotemporal node-conflict constraints that prevent simultaneous vehicle access to occupied nodes and (ii) flexible UAV operations, enabling chained multi-task sorties and cross-vehicle recovery. To solve this NP-hard problem, we propose a Multi-Strategy Improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (M-SIALNS) algorithm. Beyond standard ALNS frameworks, M-SIALNS incorporates a cluster-based initialization method, task-chain destroy–repair operators, and air–ground coordination strategies specifically tailored for the bi-layer structure. These strategies enhance global search, solution feasibility, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets and a power-grid case study demonstrate the advantages of M-SIALNS. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, it reduces inspection duration by 1.6%–11.0%, consistently delivering statistically significant improvements. Ablation and sensitivity analyses confirm the contribution of tailored operators and provide managerial insights into optimal fleet configurations and resource allocation thresholds. This work advances both the theoretical modeling of bi-layer vehicle–UAV routing and its practical deployment in large-scale inspection missions."

The theoretical analytical challenge lies in designing the Nash-minmax gaming strategy for such MPE games under directed graphs with external disturbances. Intra-alliance cooperation (pursuers and their peer neighbors) is regarded as a nonzero-sum game, while interalliance confrontation (multiple pursuers versus one evader) is treated as another zero-sum game. To tackle this issue, a hierarchical gaming framework is established to solve the associated coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation and accordingly derive the associated distributed gaming protocol. Finally, both numerical simulations and lake-based multi-autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) gaming experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the present MPE gaming strategy."

Conventional classification systems are based on manual inspection, which is tedious, subjective and liable to inconsistencies. To solve the problems, this research suggests a deep learning-based solution with the fine-tuned ResNet50 model to automatically classify coffee beans into four categories; green, light roast, medium roast, and dark roast. The data set, retrieved in the open source Kaggle platform, is composed of 4,800 high-resolution images equally distributed in the four categories. To increase variability and decrease overfitting, preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation were used. The experimental findings revealed a high accuracy of 98%, a high precision, recall, and f1-scores of all classes. The results demonstrate the promise of deep learning as a stable, effective, and scalable approach to assessing the quality of coffee beans and automating agriculture."

    "abstract": "The necessity of new spectrum for 6G has intensified global interest in radio propagation measurements across emerging frequency bands, use cases, and antenna types. These measurements are vital for understanding the fundamentals of radio channel properties in diverse environments, and involve time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive campaigns. A major challenge for the effective utilization of the data generated from propagation measurement campaigns has been the lack of a standardized format for reporting and archiving results. Although organizations such as NIST, NGA, and 3GPP have made commendable efforts toward data pooling, a unified machine-readable data format for consolidating measurements across different institutions and frequencies remains a critical missing piece in advancing global standardization efforts and maximizing the utility of collected data. This paper introduces a new, standardized point-data format for wireless propagation measurements and demonstrates how multiple institutions may merge disparate measurement campaigns into a common format for global access. This data format, when used alongside an environmental map and a measurement summary metadata table, enables the seamless integration of radio propagation data from disparate sources by using a structured representation of key propagation parameters. Here, we show the efficacy of the proposed point-data format standard using data gathered from two independent sub-THz urban microcell (UMi) campaigns: 142 GHz measurements at New York University (NYU) and 145 GHz measurements at the University of Southern California (USC). A joint path loss analysis using the close-in path loss model with a 1 m reference distance yields a refined estimate of the path loss exponent (PLE) employing the proposed standard to pool measurements from the two different organizations. Other key statistics such as RMS delay spread and angular spread are determined using datasets from the two different institutions cast in the standardized format. Adopting this simple, unified format will accelerate comprehensive channel model development, build multi-institutional datasets, and feed AI/ML applications with reliable training data in a common format from many sources."

Built upon the device-level strengths of $\\mathrm{Ag} / \\mathrm{GaO}_{\\mathrm{x}} / \\mathrm{Pt}$ memristor, particularly its high-speed oscillation and low-power behavior, the proposed TRNG design incorporates these features into its core architecture. We introduce a novel high-entropy approach that exploits stochastic fluctuations during memristor oscillation to generate true random bits. Experimental results show that TRNG achieves a generation rate of $167 \\mathrm{~kb} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and an energy consumption of $6.36 \\mathrm{fJ} \\mathrm{bit}^{-1}$, making it well-suited for future energy-efficient and lightweight security applications."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of the recently proposed concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (FRIS) on covert communications. Specifically, we consider a communication scenario where a legitimate transmitter aims to covertly deliver information to its intended receiver through a planar FRIS, while an adversary attempts to detect whether any transmission is occurring. In this context, we analyze the false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities, and derive a closed-form expression for the covertness outage probability (COP). Furthermore, the success probability is characterized under the optimal detection threshold, providing new insights into the trade-off between covertness and reliable transmission. Numerical results reveal that FRIS provides a clear advantage over fixed-position RIS at low-to-moderate transmit powers by improving reliability and enhancing covertness, while at very high power levels, fixed-position RIS may sustain slightly higher success probability due to reduced leakage toward the adversary."

This paper presents a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) based framework for predicting per-frame latency across heterogeneous devices and varying network states. We decompose total latency into modular components: frame duration, inference time, and data transfer latency, and model each using probabilistic machine learning techniques capable of uncertainty quantification and extrapolation.Our dual-model approach first estimates frame duration based on system configurations (e.g., data compression, model type, compute resources) and then uses this intermediate output to predict overall task latency. We further assess generalization on a previously unseen dataset, simulating real-world conditions with fluctuating bandwidth, image quality settings, and computational heterogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate high predictive accuracy (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> > 0.99 for frame duration and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> > 0.99 for inference latency), with well-calibrated confidence intervals (PICP approx95%).The proposed framework enables robust, real-time latency forecasting in volatile communication networks and supports risk-aware task placement, autonomous scheduling, and resource management.

This paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) can develop effective and secure tools for auditing AI-developed autonomous agents in a competitive game environment. To model this scenario, we focus on a modified version of weighted Rock-Paper-Scissors, specifically Glico, as a testbed for adversarial AI competition. We then prompted the LLM to generate various strategy bots to play the game, including: a pattern-based bot, a cyclic-strategy bot, a random-move bot, and a reinforcement learning bot using Q-learning. The bot development process was iterative, with the LLM refining code in response to functional errors identified through custom dynamic testing strategies. We evaluated the performance of each bot (win/loss rates, time to win), as well as analyzed the security of the AI-generated code using static analysis tools. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs can generate functional game-playing agents, doing so requires multiple prompt iterations and human guidance. Even then, security vulnerabilities remain when deploying AI-generated code in user-created environments like the tested gaming platform. The results of this project aim to provide insight into the practical potential of LLMs to develop AI within restricted, goal-driven environments."

Maintaining product quality in such manufacturing settings using conventional manual inspection techniques is unreliable and ineffective, especially in situations involving large production volumes. To overcome these challenges,To address the limitations of manual inspection, this work presents an automated defect detection system powered by computer vision and weight sensing. The work combines physical weight validation along with computer-vision-based on deep learning for real-time defect detection on plastic bottles. The system uses MobileNetV2 on a Raspberry Pi to classify visual defects from bottle images. A load cell connected to an Arduino Uno weighs the bottle and sends the data to the Raspberry Pi via serial communication in order to identify minute defects like leakage or underfilling. A simple fusion rule combines both the visual output and weight reading to finalize whether a bottle is defective or not. For analytics and traceability, every result including pictures, weights, and classification choices is recorded in a structured database. With an accuracy of over 95%, the system provides a viable and scalable solution for smart factories and Industry 4.0 environments and can be easily extended to other manufacturing domains."

    "abstract": "The rise of smart factories is transforming manufacturing and service delivery using robots and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for advanced tasks like autonomous navigation. While over-the-top (OTT) solutions reduce local compute and energy demands by offloading machine learning (ML) tasks to remote servers, they lack task-aware optimization. This limitation is critical for complex applications like autonomous navigation, where performance depends on dynamic device and network conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Context-aware Adaptive inference for Machine-Task Execution in Complex environments (CAMTEC). It incorporates performance metrics from compute, energy, network, and ML to generate the context of machine task performance (e.g., UGV navigation). CAMTEC utilizes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to learn from this context information to determine the optimal inferencing mode (local, remote, or split) and vehicle speed to ensure optimal performance of an off-the-shelf object detection-based navigation algorithm. Extensive real-world testbed evaluations demonstrate CAMTEC’s efficacy in achieving collision-free autonomous navigation. CAMTEC adheres to a computationally optimal allocation strategy throughout the vehicle’s trajectory, ensuring that the actual-to-target speed variation remains below 20% even under battery-constrained conditions. Furthermore, even when network bandwidth is severely limited, CAMTEC ensures that the UGV converges to the optimal path while keeping the actual-to-target speed variation below 30%."

This paper presents a sequence-to-sequence LSTM autoencoder with a bidirectional encoder and Bahdanau-style attention decoder to capture short-term temporal dependencies in multivariate telemetry data. The model is trained on fixed-length sequences extracted from MAVLink logs containing 17 key features related to attitude, velocity, and position. To increase data diversity and coverage, we generated additional training sequences through high-fidelity flight simulation. A custom QGroundControl plugin was developed to efficiently filter and log only the most relevant MAVLink packets, enabling streamlined and targeted data acquisition. By learning compact latent representations, the autoencoder distinguishes nominal behavior from anomalies using reconstruction error. For deployment, the model is compiled to ONNX and served via a FastAPI-based inference system with WebSocket support for real-time monitoring. Sensitivity analysis reveals which sensor modalities most influence reconstruction quality. Our system demonstrates competitive performance on both simulated and real-world datasets, offering a scalable, interpretable, and lightweight solution for UAV anomaly detection."

The main contributions of the paper are: the definition of the internal structure of a generic manageable AIF, the AIF Runtime Pipeline (RTP) and Model Training Pipelines (MTP) used for AIF model observation, training, and update, and additional components for efficient integration of the approach with the network Management Plane (MP) and Network Digital Twin (NDT).

    "abstract": "Hand gesture detection, which has uses in robotics, virtual reality, healthcare, and sign language translation, is a key component of human–computer interaction. Since movement-based dynamic hand gestures vary over time, look similar across categories, and are influenced by lighting or background, they are more difficult to recognize. In contrast to deep learning, which can automatically learn both geographical and temporal information, traditional approaches that rely on manually created features frequently perform poorly across datasets. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in this paper to capture spatial details such as hand forms and finger locations, whereas recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) units, are used to learn temporal patterns like motion dynamics. By efficiently modeling both static hand postures and motion dynamics, our hybrid approach enhances the system's recognition performance on benchmark datasets. When it comes to complicated gestures that involve fine finger movements or overlapping motions, experimental results show better accuracy and robustness than traditional CNN-only or RNN-only models. In real-world applications where high accuracy, flexibility, and real-time recognition are essential, the study also highlights the viability of such hybrid designs. In order to promote advancements in touch less interfaces, immersive gaming, and assistive technology for people with impairments, the work demonstrates a path toward more dependable and natural interaction systems by integrating the advantages of complementing deep learning models This work provides an important information for researchers and those interested in improving the human-machine communication which highlights the potential of hybrid deep learning models for dynamic hand gesture detection."

Developing robust machine learning (ML)-driven NIDS requires extensive network traffic datasets, where flow-based analysis is essential for detecting suspicious traffic patterns and improving model performance. Since network traffic data often contains sensitive information and is subject to strict privacy and security regulations, there is a notable scarcity of publicly accessible, realistic network traffic flow datasets for research. Moreover, many existing open-source datasets are highly class imbalanced, posing significant challenges for researchers. While some researchers have created NIDS datasets using testbeds or network simulations, configuring complex network topologies is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to customize. To the best of our knowledge, the generation of realistic network flow datasets remains a major obstacle in NIDS research. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating various types of synthetic data across domains. However, to date, no existing work has explored their application in generating datasets to facilitate NIDS research. This study establishes a comprehensive evaluation pipeline to assess the effectiveness of several representative and state-of-the-art generative AI models for synthetic flow data generation in the NIDS domain. Our extensive experiments on three widely used NIDS datasets demonstrate that ML models trained on synthetic flow data generated by LLM-based generative AI methods can achieve macro-average F1 scores of up to 86%, outperforming other generative AI approaches in classifying benign and attack types."

The findings show that RESNET152 has the best accuracy and F1-score because its deep residual learning architecture makes it easier to extract useful features. This is why it has the best categorization performance. By getting the lowest MSE, the highest PSNR, and the strongest SSIM, NASNetMobile shows that it can keep the structure of an image intact while minimizing distortion. This makes it better than other models in terms of image improvement measures. ConvRESNAS152 has room to grow because it often does poorly on several different measures. Even though ConvNeXt Tiny is efficient, its small architecture makes it perform significantly worse than other models when it comes to augmentation and classification tasks. The results show that both models have their pros and cons. RESNET152 is better for classification tasks, while NASNetMobile is better for picture improvement.

The conventional approach of secured solutions that utilize the centralized approach is becoming improper to secure distributed and autonomous systems that are embedded within urban settings. The current paper introduces a new blockchain-enabled paradigm which can be used to secure the cybernetics control networks and it makes use of decentralized consensus, cryptographic validation of transactions and impenetrable lists. The structure suits lightweight blockchain nodes in partnership with industrial control systems and Internet of Things (IoT) units to guarantee secure communication, verifiable execution of commands, and tamper-free tracking of events. Hybrid architecture that uses permission blockchain and smart contracts is a method to achieve granular access control, anomaly detection, and safe firmware upgrades over large cityscale networks (traffic control, energy grids, and public surveillance). Through experimental analysis, it has been shown how the framework is effective in its ability to prevent and subdue cyber-attacks like the attack of spoofing, replay, and unauthorized access to the system with minimal latency and scalable to the level seen during the urban deployment mode. The suggested method offers a long-term, strong, and clear process to make the security of cybernetics control networks stronger, which creates an outstanding basis of the trust-based development of next-generation smart cities."

SIM provisioning and lifecycle management become increasingly costly, while reliance on long-term symmetric keys limits revocation flexibility and cross-operator support. To address these issues, we propose a SIM-less, certificate-based authentication framework that integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Specifically, the framework employs Kyber for key encapsulation and Dilithium for digital signatures, providing quantum-resistant protection for future networks. A key challenge is the computational overhead of PQC on constrained IoT devices; we address this by offloading cryptographic operations to trusted edge servers, whose integrity is validated using attestation mechanisms such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) or secure enclaves. We implement and evaluate the framework in a simulated FutureG environment, comparing IoT-only execution against edge-assisted configurations. Results show that edge offloading reduces TLS handshake latency by up to 96% while maintaining minimal resource usage on devices. These findings demonstrate that PQC-enabled PKI, combined with edge-assisted execution, offers a scalable and practical complement to SIM/AKA for secure and quantum-resilient authentication in FutureG IoT deployments."

    "abstract": "High-resolution Satellite Image Time Series (SITS), combined with advanced deep learning approaches such as transformers, enable reliable change detection by effectively using large amounts of temporal data. While most existing change detection methods overlook temporal dynamics and focus primarily on spatial features, Transformers are well-suited to capture both spatial and temporal features. This paper presents a Transformer-based spatio-temporal architecture for multi-annual change detection that integrates two key components: an Adaptive Swin Transformer Encoder (ASTE) for hierarchical feature extraction and a Feature Difference Module (FDM) to highlight changes for generating change detection maps. ASTE incorporates a Cross Attention Fusion (CAF) module, which integrates convolutional operations for spatial feature extraction and Swin Transformer to extract spatio-temporal dependencies. FDM refines the difference features, enhancing feature interaction for optimization and accurate change detection. The method was tested in the Trentino region of Italy, focusing on deforestation caused by the Vaia storm."

Medical image analysis has greatly benefited from deep learning, however single-model architectures frequently have poor generalization and sensitivity to imaging differences. In order to accomplish effective and extremely accurate brain tumor grade classification from MRI scans, this research suggests a novel Multi-View Ensemble Deep Learning Framework (MVE-DLF) that combines the complementary strengths of CNN, Transformer-based, and lightweight attention networks. The ensemble combines predictions from ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3, and a modified Swin-Transformer branch using a weighted adaptive fusion module. The suggested model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with 94.8% classification accuracy, according to experimental results on the BraTS2021 dataset.

However, most existing hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) approaches fail to meet these. To this end, this brief proposes Virtual-Coprocessor-in-the-Loop (VCIL), a pipeline-tight HIL framework for cycle-accurate RISC-V coprocessor verification. It bypasses the TLM2.0 bus and tightly couples the coprocessor to the pipeline via UART, which reduces transmissions and improves simulation speed. Additionally, a timing dynamic calibration method is introduced to enhance timing accuracy and enable early detection of timing violations. Compared to the state-of-the-art Virtual-Peripheral-in-the-Loop (VPIL) framework, VCIL improves simulation speed by $4.8 \\times$ and reduces timing errors by 35.9%. Experiments conducted on the SM3/SM4 coprocessor demonstrate that VCIL reduces verification time by 53.4%, and the timing error is only 3.5% compared to the RTL full-system. Our code will be available at https://github.com/LX-IC/VCIL."

    "abstract": "In next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) systems, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) face concurrent challenges of energy imbalance, insecure communication, and unreliable routing due to the dynamic and distributed nature of sensor nodes. This paper presents an AI-driven Federated Trust and Energy Optimization (FTEO) framework that integrates Adaptive Clustering and Trust-Aware Routing (ACTAR) principles, a Non-Uniform and Optimized Clustering Mechanism (NUOCM), and a hybrid multi-objective optimization model to achieve secure and energy-efficient communication. The framework operates in three intelligent phases: (i) Smart Hybrid Clustering (SHC), which employs a Firefly–PSO–Genetic hybrid optimizer to form non-uniform clusters for minimizing energy imbalance; (ii) Intelligent Cluster Head Optimization (ICHO), which applies reinforcement learning for optimal cluster head rotation to balance residual energy and reduce latency; and (iii) Blockchain-Enabled Trust Routing (BETR), which employs federated learning-assisted trust computation and blockchain-based authentication to ensure secure and tamper-proof routing. Comprehensive MATLAB simulations demonstrate that FTEO outperforms conventional ACTAR, HTBR, and LEACH protocols by achieving 47.6% higher energy efficiency, 41% lower routing overhead, and 96.8% malicious node detection accuracy, while maintaining a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 94.7% under 40% malicious node intrusion. The results confirm that the integration of NUOCM-based clustering, hybrid optimization, and federated trust routing significantly enhances network lifetime, reliability, and security in IoT-enabled WSNs."

When it comes to educational social networks, this problem becomes much more pressing because it is essential to safeguard both students and teachers while encouraging engagement through strong access control and privacy preservation measures. To solve this problem, the research presents a hybrid optimization approach that can improve data management and network security. The raw social network data is preprocessed before feature extraction using the LRM technique is carried out. To get around the drawbacks of each strategy, they create a new hybrid approach that uses fuzzy logic for parameter adjustment and combines GA and PSO. By combining GA with Fuzzy-PSO, we may take advantage of the best features of both optimization methods, and the use of fuzzy logic guarantees fair results. The suggested solution achieves a maximum accuracy of 98.10% and routinely beats standalone GA and PSO, according to experimental data based on benchmark mathematical functions. These results show that the hybrid method greatly improves optimization efficiency, providing a strong answer to the problems of educational social networks' privacy protection and access control."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of digital communication systems has increased exposure to sophisticated cyberattacks, creating a strong need for intrusion detection methods that can adapt and respond intelligently. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) struggle with identifying uncommon or newly emerging threats because real-world network data typically contains far more normal traffic than malicious activity. This imbalance causes models to learn unevenly, often leading to biased predictions and higher false-negative rates.To address these shortcomings, this work introduces Balanced-IDS, a hybrid deep-learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, supported by both data-level and model-level balancing strategies. The CNN layers extract spatial features from network traffic, while the LSTM component captures their sequential patterns. To ensure fair learning across classes, the framework incorporates the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) along with cost-sensitive training, enabling the model to give appropriate attention to underrepresented attack types during optimization. Comprehensive experiments performed on benchmark datasets—including NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and UNSW-NB15—show that Balanced-IDS delivers significant upgrades in accuracy, recall, and F1-score compared with existing IDS approaches. The results confirm that the proposed system reduces false negatives and strengthens detection performance across a wide range of attack scenarios, making it a reliable and scalable choice for large-scale cybersecurity environments."

The system combines Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) signals with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to reflect the signals throughout the space to improve signal diversity. It uses two software-defined radios (USRPs), one as a transmitter and one as a receiver. This setup helps the system pick up useful reflections regardless the person's position in the space, whether they're closer to the transmitter, the receiver, or somewhere in between. At the receiver's end, we process the reflected signals by performing Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis to generate Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots, which we convert into image data. These are then fed into a DL model combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module which extracts spatial features from each frame and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) module that captures temporal patterns across multiple frames. This combination allows the system to make accurate posture predictions in real time."

This work demonstrates that low-temperature supercritical fluid (SCF) treatment effectively addresses these limitations. Through systematic electrical measurements, Hall effect analysis, and material characterizations, Significant improvements were observed, with the contact resistance decreasing by 35 to 61.5 percent (from 31.6/40.5 kiloohms to 20.5/17.5 kiloohms) for different electrode configurations, while the Hall mobility increases from 7.9 to 9.0 square centimeters per volt-second. Energy band analysis reveals a reduced Schottky barrier height at the metal/p-GaN interface, facilitating enhanced hole injection and ohmic contact behavior. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms weakened Mg-H bonding and promoted Mg activation, whereas Raman spectroscopy verifies no induced lattice stress. Photoluminescence (PL) shows intensified near-band-edge (NBE) and blue luminescence (BL) emissions, indicating suppressed non-radiative recombination and higher acceptor activation. These findings establish SCF processing as a non-destructive, scalable method to engineer high-performance p-GaN for optoelectronic and power devices."

The TM-IRS is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the authorized directions we formulate in this work. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search.

We describe the system architecture, key modules (cryptographic layer, zero-trust engine, authentication and authorization layers, and governance services), and a testing methodology that includes quantum-attack simulation, behavioral anomaly detection, and performance benchmarking. Experimental validation on a prototype demonstrates acceptable authentication latency, sub-100 ms trust score evaluation, and quantum-resistant key generation within practical bounds for enterprise use.

Traditional anomaly detection methods based on machine learning typically depend on centralized training, which not only poses privacy risks but also encounters challenges related to scalability and limited generalization across heterogeneous networks. To address these issues, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on federated learning that facilitates decentralized model training while safeguarding the data privacy of HPRNs. By incorporating a feature-based transfer learning methodology, our approach improves model generalization across non-IID datasets and enhances robustness in environments with sparse data, thus mitigating the adverse effects of heterogeneous infrastructure conditions and limited training data availability. Our method undergoes extensive evaluation on datasets generated from various testbeds. The experimental results indicate that the proposed federated learning approach, augmented with feature-based transfer learning, achieves an accuracy of 96.56% and an F1-score of 0.9658, which significantly outperforms centralized training paradigms. Additionally, our analysis reveals that feature normalization expedites the convergence of federated learning model training, reducing the number of rounds required for stabilization from 100 to 50 rounds. These findings underscore the efficacy of our proposed federated learning-based approach in securing HPRNs and offering a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for anomaly detection in distributed research infrastructures."

While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning and other reactive strategies, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training models, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB covering six diverse attack families demonstrate the robustness of our detector. When exposed to unseen backdoor threats, the learned prompts achieve an average 86% accuracy at distinguishing previously unseen backdoor images from clean ones, outperforming baselines by up to 30 percentage points. These results establish prompt-tuned VLMs as an effective first line of defense against backdoor threats. Code and datasets will be available."

    "abstract": "The increasing need for low latency communications, driven by the envisaged growth of applications like AR/VR and autonomous vehicles, has led to renewed interest in optimizing network protocols and mechanisms. However, achieving low latency in mobile environments is particularly challenging due to their dynamic and unpredictable nature.To address this, we built a system named MobiSwift that is designed to provide low-latency and seamless connectivity in multi-access mobile networks. Its key innovations include a) Decoupling device locators from identifiers for seamless multi-access connectivity, b) Optimizing connection setup latencies through a novel overlay infrastructure, c) Routing data packets on low-latency direct paths, and d) Seamless peer-to-peer mobility handling and access switching.We developed MobiSwift using widely available, modern networking technologies like Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) and eBPF to ensure efficient and flexible packet processing and forwarding. We implemented a prototype of MobiSwift on FABRIC, a wide-area programmable network testbed, to establish feasibility with a real implementation and evaluate its performance. Our results show that MobiSwift achieves near-optimal latency, and its recovery overhead from unexpected connectivity disruption is less than 40 ms, thus demonstrating its effectiveness."

Specifically, we employ the Keysight M3300A and M9603A to measure and analyze the behavior of decision tree structures, which are shown to enable explainable network intrusion detection, using the packet-level benchmark dataset: ACI-IoT 2023. In our architecture, each chiplet represents a decision tree leaf, with boundary values stored physically as programmable 6-bit resistances in memristor devices. These resistance values are set according to trained decision tree boundaries obtained from the dataset. Input features are translated into voltages and compared against the memristive thresholds to perform inference, with node outputs indicating either attack or benign classifications."

Previously, this required generating ground-truth correlation signals, an additional engineering burden. We propose an alternative, Pairwise Neural Cross-Correlation (PNCC), that can learn denoised cross-correlation signals given only the noisy signals and the ground truth peak. Our neural network learns to transform each signal in a pair such that each transformed signal correlates highly with its untransformed partner at the ground truth. This produces a visible peak in cross-correlation close to the ground truth even at low (e.g. −20dB) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). PNCC reduces mean absolute error (MAE) of cross-correlation time delay estimates by 49.4%, Doppler shift estimates by 27.2%, and blind carrier frequency estimates by 76.3%. PNCC time delay estimates reduce location MAE by 22.8%, and PNCC Doppler shift estimates reduce velocity MAE by 1.57% in a Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Frequency Difference of Arrival (FDOA) simulation, respectively."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a semantic version of the hybrid automatic repeat request (SHARQ) protocol embedded within an enhanced split computing framework to optimize data transmission and inference accuracy over noisy wireless channels. The framework partitions a deep neural network between a user equipment (UE) and an edge server (ES). The UE processes the local portion of the model and sends the extracted semantic features to the ES, which performs the final segmentation. Through a cross-layer design, we aim to reduce transmission payload while maintaining high inference accuracy. Our framework utilizes dynamic and adaptive bottle-neck quantization to compress intermediate representations at the UE prior to transmission. Robustness against channel impairments is achieved through retransmission mechanism and finite-length low-density parity-check (LDPC) coding. Unlike conventional HARQ, SHARQ triggers retransmissions based on inference accuracy rather than packet error probability, aligning the retransmission logic with task-level performance. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of SHARQ across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, analyzing key parameters such as code rate, LDPC Hamming weight, and retransmissions number. A configuration space is established to assess inference accuracy and explore trade-offs between payload, throughput efficiency, and delay. Evaluation conducted using the Mask R-CNN model across various bottleneck sizes and code rates reveals that SHARQ significantly improves inference accuracy, particularly with the second transmission at medium SNR levels. For instance, at 0 dB and a code rate of 2/3, the second retransmission yields near-optimal accuracy, whereas additional retransmissions contribute little to no gain and increase latency. Overall, SHARQ offers an effective solution for improving semantic inference performance in wireless edge intelligence by balancing reliability, bandwidth, and delay."

A dual-L-type network is employed at the input to achieve impedance matching and reduce return loss. Both the CTLE and VGA adopt a source-degenerated architecture, offering implementation simplicity and high linearity. To enhance the bandwidth and equalization capability of the CTLE, inductive peaking and feedforward techniques are introduced. Considering the stringent linearity and noise requirements of PAM4 signal, a single-stage VGA is adopted, also employing inductive peaking to extend bandwidth. The equalization capability and gain of the CTLE and VGA are tunable via gate-voltage-controlled NMOS transistors operating in the linear region, enabling adaptability to various channel conditions. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology and operating at 1.2 V supply, post-layout simulation results show that the CTLE achieves 2.9-to-14.1dB equalization capability at the Nyquist frequency $(25 \\mathrm{GHz})$, while the VGA provides 2.5 -to-4.9dB variable gain. After equalizing a $\\mathbf{1 0. 1 d B}$ channel loss, the AFE achieves a horizontal eye opening of 0.25 UI at a bit error rate (BER) of $10^{-12}$.

We derive closed-form solutions for finite-duration pulse inputs under reaction-limited conditions and propose simplified asymptotic approximations for short- and long-pulse regimes, which accurately characterize the binding dynamics under limited receptor availability. An equivalent resistor–capacitor circuit analogy is introduced, mapping molecular binding and unbinding to time-varying and fixed resistances. Particle-based Monte Carlo simulations verify that the proposed model accurately captures the channel behavior and temporal memory of realistic biochemical receivers with finite receptor capacity."

The study investigates the out-of-band performance of the FSS relative to the operating frequency of a microstrip antenna. The proposed FSS operates in the L-band and part of the S-band, covering 0.8 GHz to 2.4 GHz with a 100% fractional bandwidth. The integrated antenna array is designed to function in the X-band at 8 GHz. Airborne antennas typically operate in the X-band, while ground-based detection systems commonly use the L and S bands to detect distant objects. To ensure operational security, the airborne antenna must remain concealed from enemy ground-based radar systems, without compromising its communication and functionality. This work presents the first experimental demonstration of a wideband time-modulated FSS operating in the L and S bands, designed to conceal a functioning X-band communication antenna. Initially, the wideband FSS is designed, followed by its integration with the antenna array to validate its performance. The structure is fabricated and experimentally tested, with measured results closely matching simulations. While the time-modulated FSS can completely cover the metallic body of an aircraft, the onboard communication antenna remains exposed to electromagnetic waves, which can provide precise information to adversary Doppler radar. To overcome this, the time-modulated FSS unit cell is designed with a transmissive top layer, ensuring seamless communication with the ground station while suppressing interference from out-of-band electromagnetic waves."

It primarily focuses on the allocation of computing resources in cloud computing systems when users are dealing with time-sensitive tasks. If users delay handling these tasks, their utility will decrease over time. In addition, users do not always stay in the computing system in this problem. For this problem, we propose a mechanism called maximin share fairness with time discount (MMS-TD) in a heterogeneous cloud computing system. We prove theoretically that the allocation returned by the mechanism is lexicographically max-min optimal, that the allocation satisfies the maximin share fairness, and that the mechanism is Pareto efficiency, proportionality, and strategy-proofness. In addition, we designed an algorithm to realize this mechanism and conducted simulation experiments with Alibaba cluster traces. The experimental results show that regardless of resource utilization or user utility, the MMS-TD mechanism consistently outperforms the other three similar mechanisms."

This systematic review compares single-scenario and multi-scenario decisionmaking techniques, categorized as rule-based, optimization, learning, and hybrid methods. It highlights gaps and advances needed to enhance flexibility and reliability for handling complex driving scenarios. Analyses show that hybrid methods tend to offer greater adaptability and security by combining explicit rules and constraints with the flexibility of learning. System evaluation uses databases, simulation, and closed-track and open-road testing, but the focus varies depending on the approach: in single-scenario, the aim is to diagnose and correct specific behaviors under controlled conditions; in multiple scenarios, the objective is to measure the system’s robustness and generalizability within the operational domain. Despite advances, gaps persist in the ability to deal with unknown and critical situations, demanding future investigations into generalization strategies, incremental learning and integration of contextual representations of the environment."

    "abstract": "To address the attenuation of levitation force between the electromagnets and rails in maglev vehicles caused by high-speed operation, this study first analyzes the generation mechanism of eddy current effects (ECE) based on electromagnetic field theory. A high-precision surrogate model for air-gap magnetic field calculation is established, incorporating the actual topological structure of the levitation electromagnets. Building on this foundation, an analytical electromagnetic force model accounting for ECE in both rails and electromagnets is developed. This model enables efficient parametric analysis of eddy current influences and is directly applicable to inverse problems in electromagnet topology optimization. To address the challenges posed by ECE on the engineering application of speed increase in medium and low speed maglev vehicles, this paper analyzes the limitations of existing end-mounted levitation electromagnet structures. Based on the current balance optimization principle between front and rear suspension points, a non-dominated solution set for structural optimization parameters is derived, aiming to mitigate uneven load distribution and compensate for ECE. Dynamic simulation results demonstrate that the optimized electromagnet structure effectively compensates for ECE while simultaneously enhancing track compatibility at levitation points. Experimental results indicate that at 140 km/h, the currents at both front and rear levitation points of the end-mounted electromagnets reach a balanced state, remaining below the rated value of 35A. The outcomes of this study provide theoretical guidance for optimizing levitation systems in medium and low speed maglev vehicles at higher speed levels."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed clients but remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, especially stealthy ones. The threat is even amplified in non-IID settings, where client heterogeneity causes greater divergence in feature distributions and inter-client distances. Existing defenses often rely on strong assumptions or raw update distances, limiting their effectiveness under such heterogeneity. To address this gap, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedRefiner</i>, a decoupled dual-refined aggregation algorithm designed to mitigate stealthy attacks on heterogeneous data. Our intuition is that the significance distribution of client updates reveals subtle malicious evasion, altering critical features for attack while perturbing unimportant ones, thereby exposing true inter-client distances. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedRefiner</i> goes beyond norm-based filtering by refining both weighted scores and aggregated updates, enabling more accurate distinction between malicious behavior and benign non-IID variation. It first derives significance distribution vectors as refined updates by sparsity, then clusters them to compute weighted similarity scores for group reliability. These clusters then align raw updates into groups for group-wise refinement, yielding robust aggregated updates. We theoretically prove the convergence of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FedRefiner</i> under Byzantine attacks in non-IID settings.

Ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across different hyperparameters, attacker ratios, data heterogeneity, and model/client scales, while incurring low computation and no storage overhead."

Using a qualitative single-case study at SSAB, we analyse semi-structured interviews, project artefacts, and internal communications, iterating abductively between data and theory. Guided by Stewardship Theory and project governance research, we map decision rights, accountability, and information flows across locations and functions. Findings show that adaptive communication networks anchored in explicit governance mechanisms, i.e. clear role charters, cadence calendars, escalation paths, and gated decision points, reduce ambiguity and coordination loss. Informal practices, including cross-site champions and community-of-practice touchpoints, complement formal protocols by brokering knowledge and sustaining shared purpose. The interplay between formal and informal structures improved timeliness of information, alignment on deliverables, and proactive risk handling in geographically dispersed settings. We propose a practical design for communication governance that specifies who convenes whom, on what cadence, with what artefacts, and how exceptions escalate. The study extends Stewardship Theory to automation-oriented, distributed projects by showing how trust-based, collective-interest framing can coexist with lightweight controls. Implications include a diagnostic for assessing communication gaps and actionable guidance for configuring roles, routines, and artefacts when scaling RPA initiatives across sites."

    "abstract": "This research addresses real faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems in Cuba, as these faults result in damage to all converters, whether in operation or not, when atmospheric discharge strikes nearby. This phenomenon occurs in PV systems connected to the grid through a power transformer with an ungrounded connection on the converter side. The research examines the phenomenon of impulsive overvoltages originating from the grounding system of PV installations after lightning. A simplified model was created using MATLAB/Simulink, encompassing PV system devices with converters, surge protection devices (SPDs), metal oxide varistors (MOVs), a grounding system, and an impulsive overvoltage source simulating a lightning strike. The simulation results suggest that these overvoltages have a detrimental effect on the coordination of the SPDs and MOVs inside the inverter, which in turn damages the inverter and other devices in the PV system. This research is pioneering in its approach to addressing this phenomenon in PV systems, characterized by this study as back flash overvoltage (BFO). BFO impacts the devices connected to direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) branches. The model demonstrates that modifying the output transformer connection on the low-voltage side (the converter side) to a grounded star connection significantly reduces the occurrence of damage to the inverter and other components of the PV system. The BFO has not been adequately addressed in international standards pertaining to safety in PV installations. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations pertaining to the implementation of the proposed solution."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on artificial intelligence (AI)-based tuning of conventional PI, PID, and fractional-order PI/PID (FOPI/FOPID) controllers applied to a three-phase inverter supplying an electric vehicle (EV) charging station. The motivation arises from the increasing penetration of EVs and their dynamic charging profiles, which impose significant challenges on inverter control, including voltage regulation and harmonic suppression. While classical tuning methods such as Bode-based approaches are well studied, the application of AI methods such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fractional-order controllers in EV charging scenarios remains underexplored. The study uses a MATLAB/Simulink model representing a three-phase EV load (modelled after a 22 kW Renault Zoe with balanced 3-phase demand), and tests the controllers under three scenarios: step load (clustered EV arrivals), ramp load (gradual charging), and stochastic load (Poisson-distributed EV arrivals with normally distributed durations). Performance is evaluated in terms of voltage response, overshoot, settling time, total harmonic distortion (THD), and error metrics (ISE, R²). Results demonstrate that AI-tuned FOPID controllers achieve superior dynamic performance and harmonic suppression compared to AI-tuned PI and PID, with ANFIS providing the best accuracy and RL offering faster convergence. The findings highlight the potential of AI-enhanced control for next-generation EV charging stations integrated into smart grids."

    "abstract": "To avoid the operational interference and increased cost caused by encoder installation in rotating machinery, tacholess order tracking (TLOT) based on vibration signals plays an important role in instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation. However, existing TLOT methods are susceptible to noise and overly reliant on prior information, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved backward ridge-tracking (IBRT) algorithm with an adaptive dynamic search range. The proposed method incorporates the chirp rate to enhance the backward ridge-tracking strategy and constructs an adaptive cost function, which effectively reduces the penalty on true ridge frequency variations under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, automatically balances peak amplitude and IF continuity, and requires no manual parameter tuning. In addition, an adaptive ridge search boundary is designed based on the improved tracking strategy to enhance noise robustness. Comparative experiments with four existing IF extraction methods demonstrate that IBRT exhibits significant advantages in noise suppression and parameter adaptivity."

We derive series-based analytical expressions for the generalized secrecy outage probability, average fractional equivocation, and average information leakage rate. These expressions clearly characterize how random FCE affects secrecy performance under joint channel impairments. Numerical results show that including random FCE enhances the secrecy performance of an FSO-FC system by approximately 86%. The impact of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, aperture diameter, average FCE, and lens focal length on secrecy of the proposed FSO-FC system is also examined."

A two-level MLCM framework is designed, in which the SC-LDPC component codes are compatible with the fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) LDPC codes, and the message length allocations are optimized through the protograph-based extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) analysis. Besides, an SPC constraint of message bits is introduced between different SC-LDPC codes to further lower the error floor. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MLCM scheme achieves significant gains over the conventional 5G-NR LDPC codes using bit-interleaved coded modulation, while also notably reducing decoding complexity."

Specifically, a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction can support the decision-making process for predictive maintenance. With the development of vision sensors and deep learning technologies, image-based RUL prediction, including acquired images from machine vision and synthetic images from image-encoding approaches, has attracted considerable attention. Against this background, this paper investigates the development trend, classification, characteristics, and typical applications of RUL prediction using image sensors and image encoding methods. Firstly, a global view is summarised from the perspective of development trends, the usage phase of RUL prediction in typical components and systems, and primary motivations of image-based methods. Subsequently, related work on acquired and synthetic images is reviewed from the perspectives of computational mechanisms, characteristics, and related research. Then, image-only processing and multimodal fusion in RUL prediction are discussed. Finally, this paper concludes with a summary of the key scientific issues and potential future research."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are key enablers for cooperative intelligent tasks in Internet of Everything (IoE) environments, like environmental monitoring and disaster response. Meanwhile, Digital Twin (DT) technology is rapidly advancing in academia and industry due to its potential to design, test, and optimize evolving IoE networks. While DT-empowered UAV swarms provide a compelling solution for complex tasks, challenges remain in jointly designing swarm control and service provision strategies, especially in dynamic IoE environments. To harness the potential of UAV swarm intelligence, we propose a DT-empowered cluster formation technique employing the Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp) transmission scheme for energy-efficient IoE data aggregation, where UAV and IoE device clusters are dynamically constructed and adjusted. Furthermore, we consider the limited power resources by maximizing energy efficiency, which leads to a joint cluster formation, multi-UAV trajectory design, and power allocation problem under the constraint of AirComp signal distortion. To efficiently solve this mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming problem, we develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on the block coordinate descent method. Simulation results show that the proposed DT-empowered AirComp cluster formation technique achieves up to 42% higher energy efficiency and 34% greater throughput than the baselines, validating its potential for efficient data aggregation tasks."

    "abstract": "Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the transceiver. In this paper, we investigate the practical low-complexity design of 6DMA-enabled communication systems, including transmission protocol, statistical channel information (SCI) acquisition, and joint position and rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces based on the SCI of users. Specifically, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm is proposed for the estimation of SCI of users at all possible position-rotation pairs of 6DMA surfaces based on the channel measurements at a small subset of positionrotation pairs. Then, the average sum logarithmic rate of all users is maximized by jointly designing the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces based on their SCI acquired. Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt alternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we propose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA rotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized rotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while achieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the proposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication throughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation) antenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation."

To this end, this paper designs a shared data auditing scheme that supports fine-grained access control and cloud deduplication. First, combining Random Convergent Encryption (RCE), Proof-of-Ownership (PoW) technology, and introducing a certificate-less cryptosystem to securely deduplicate data in the cloud while eliminating certificate management and key escrow risks. Second, the data is encrypted using Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) technology, and only authorized users can decrypt the data based on attribute matching, which can effectively resist the risk of data leakage due to unauthorized access. At the same time, we designate an auditor to carry out data integrity auditing to prevent malicious audit behavior. Finally, Security and performance evaluations show that the scheme we’ve proposed is quite efficient and competitive."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the interplay between the retailer's strategic information sharing and the manufacturer's quality decisions under two decision sequences: pre-quality and post-quality scenarios. We analyze the retailer's ex-post information sharing policy (deciding how to share the obtained demand information) under both sequences, discuss the impact of decision sequences on the quality level, and explore the preferences of supply chain participants for pre- and post-quality scenarios. The key findings are as follows: In the post-quality scenario, if consumers have high quality sensitivity, the retailer tends to share high-demand information but conceal low-demand information; otherwise, the result is just the opposite. Conversely, in the pre-quality scenario, the retailer consistently shares low-demand information but conceals high-demand information. Notably, whether in the pre-quality or post-quality scenario, an intriguing phenomenon may emerge, that is, the retailer may experience a counterintuitive increase in profit as the expected information cost rises. The outcomes of quality levels in pre- and post-quality scenarios depend on the information status obtained by the retailer and the consumers' quality sensitivity. Interestingly, the retailer consistently prefers the post-quality scenario, while the manufacturer may prefer the pre-quality scenario under certain conditions. Finally, our findings remain relatively robust when considering imperfect information acquisition or a general demand distribution."

    "abstract": "Fuzzy classification models are important for handling uncertainty and heterogeneity in high-dimensional data. Although recent fuzzy logistic regression approaches have demonstrated promising results, challenges remain in managing multicollinearity and performing effective feature selection for mixed-type predictors. This study proposes a Fuzzy LASSO Logistic Regression (FLLR) framework that integrates triangular fuzzy membership functions with LASSO regularization to address these issues. The proposed approach fuzzifies continuous, ordinal, and categorical features, performs variable selection via LASSO logistic regression, and mitigates multicollinearity through Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) screening. The model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation, and its performance was evaluated using four key metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrated that FLLR achieves strong predictive performance while preserving model interpretability. Comparative analyses with existing fuzzy logistic regression models and a standard artificial neural network further confirmed the robustness and practical utility of the proposed framework for uncertainty-aware decision-making using mixed-type data."

Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology newly emerges as a novel charging approach that can remotely power IoTDs. It alleviates the need for manual battery replacement in IoTDs and accelerates the deployment of IoT networks. Meanwhile, traditional on-grid energy consumption of a huge number of IoTDs leads to the dramatic increase of global carbon emissions. As a sustainable alternative, wirelessly charging IoTDs by Green energy empowered Power Beacons (GPBs) has become increasingly promising. Therefore, with utilizing green energy, in this work, we provide detailed analysis on the constructive interference of multiple electromagnetic wave charging beams and systematically present the theoretical derivations on the reception power of IoTDs. By considering the ElectroMagnetic Radiation (EMR) during wireless charging, we propose a precise EMR safety model. In order to improve the far-field wireless charging efficiency under the EMR constraint, we further formulate the IoTDs depletion ratio minimization problem. As this problem is proved to be NP-hard, we propose the Safety dynAmical wIreless Charging (SAIC) algorithm to efficiently solve it. This algorithm aims to enable efficient wireless charging for the IoTDs while strictly limiting the EMR level below the specified radiation threshold. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the superiority of our algorithm."

Transmitting more either results in detection or decoding errors. The SRL imposes significant constraints on hardware realization of mathematically guaranteed covert communication. Indeed, they preclude using standard link maintenance operations that are taken for granted in non-covert communication. Thus, experimental validation of covert communication is underexplored: to date, only two experimental studies of SRL-based covert communication are available, both focusing on optical channels. Here, we report a demonstration of provably secure covert radio-frequency (RF) communication using software-defined radios (SDRs). This validates theoretical predictions, opens practical avenues for implementing covert communication systems, and raises further research questions."

Such important functional modules are secure authentication, including OTP support, driver authentication, such as license upload, controlled ride creation/search, manual QR-based payment verification, gender-aware seat assignment at the booking close time, credit of reward points, and ride history tracking. The system incorporates support AI elements including OCR-based extraction of transaction IDs when shown on payment screens and analysis of screenshot similarities to identify fraud to increase usability and security. Ridezipp offers a scalable, convenient, and safety-first design approach to intercity ride sharing with the help of rule-based automation and selective AI assistance to ensure reliability and provide users with a comfortable experience. The proposed system can help in understanding how smart constraints and specific AI implementation can enhance trust, performance, and customer experience in shared mobility systems to a large magnitude."

    "abstract": "As machine learning systems become integral to military applications, for example, they face increasingly sophisticated adversarial threats. Conventional defenses often fail because they typically assume static adversarial strategies, lack real-time adaptation, and overlook complex data distributions and topological structures. To overcome this, we present TAP-GAN+, a real-time adversarial detection framework that integrates Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Topological Data Analysis, dual-generator adversarial simulation, and entropy-aware decision logic. The pipeline first converts inputs into the frequency domain, extracting robust features via FFT and capturing multi-scale topological structures using persistent homology. These features are fused into a compact representation, enabling efficient classification into real, adversarial, or suspicious categories. Our training strategy includes a dual-generator architecture: G<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> perturbs the pixel space, simulating clean-label attacks, while G<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> introduces feature-space distortions to enhance robustness. The real-time detector evaluates fused features using entropy-based rules, ensuring low-latency decisions. Benchmark evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAKE, and CelebA datasets demonstrate superior detection accuracy, interpretability, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to prior methods. Optimized for mission-critical applications in military contexts, TAP-GAN+ enhances situational awareness by detecting adversarial threats in real-time."

    "abstract": "In 2024, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) connections reached 15.9 billion and is projected to reach 39.6 billion in 2033. Many of these connections and devices use weak or no security, making them susceptible to attack by nefarious actors. Researchers have proposed Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) as a possible IoT security solution or enhancement because it is a passive technique that effectively determines the emitter’s identity without alerting that emitter or requiring emitter modification, is capable of identifying emitters down to individual serial numbers, the most challenging SEI case, and can provide the \"something the entity is\" for zero trust multi-factor authentication. SEI typically requires high sampling rates to achieve high emitter identification performance, which can be problematic when IoT devices collect SEI-used signals. This work assesses the effectiveness of an attention-based SEI process’s ability to uniquely identify emitters that differ only in serial numbers and whose signals are collected using lower sampling rates. Attention-based SEI identifies all emitters at an accuracy of above 97% using only 2,500 signals, sampled at a rate of 5 MHz, reducing the memory needed to store them by 87.5%."

Real-time monitoring and diagnosis of strokes are made possible due to the integration of internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare industry. The optimized hybrid deep learning framework presented in this study combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Models to detect the stroke signals reliably by EEG signals. To increase the accuracy of categorization and computational effectiveness, the proposed model uses CNN algorithm for spatial feature extraction, LSTT algorithm for temporal sequence learning, and GRU algorithm for learning an effective memory optimization mechanism. In order to ensure a fair and unbiased training of the models, complex data balancing techniques are implemented to deal with data imbalance issues which are observed in a large part of clinical EEG data. Through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, the framework also combines the principles of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in providing clinical decision support model predictions that are transparent and interpretable. With an overall detection accuracy of 99%, experimental validation on benchmark EEG datasets is able to demonstrate better results compared to traditional techniques. An important step towards intelligent, interpretable, and trustworthy stroke detection is represented by the suggested IoT-enabled intelligent system, which assists with the effective diagnosis and real-time patient monitoring, as is the case in contemporary clinical settings."

We extend secure projectionbased precoding with unconstrained power per access point (AP) to locally and globally constrained per-AP power schemes. Our analysis reveals that secrecy degrades under local power constraints due to a loss of orthogonality to the eavesdropper's (referred as Eve) channel, whereas perfect secrecy is achievable with globally constrained power allocation, albeit at the cost of reduced transmit power. Furthermore, we revisit the conventional secrecy rate metric to better reflect the legitimate user's (referred as Bob) achievable rate while ensuring that Eve remains unable to decode the confidential message. This refined secrecy rate definition enables a comprehensive joint analysis of secrecy performance and power consumption, leading to a relevant formulation of SEE. Theoretical findings are validated through simulations, which compare the proposed power allocation strategies and precoders against artificial noise injection scheme and the conventional unconstrained power per-AP configuration."

    "abstract": "The swift increase in data storage requirements for big data is prompting serious consideration of the privacy concerns of data, as well as securely sharing data over the cloud. The use of traditional encryption techniques, motivated through Public Key Encryption (PKE), inherently introduces the possibility of exposing the data to other users when sharing with several others and does not keep the identity of the user anonymous. Therefore, the current work is a privacy-preserving model that provides a pre-authorization privately and uses a conditional re-encryption technique for the encrypted data sharing with a group of proxies. The primary focus of this work is to provide the secure sharing of data which can be enforced by specific attribute users. The model provides a measure of assurance in that only users possessing a specified set of attributes will be able to access the encrypted data. The model uses an attribute-based authentication with a semi-trusted proxy group key with acknowledgement that the users' private key attributes will be attested to before any data is re-encrypted. Furthermore, throughout this process, the confidentiality, integrity and anonymity of the data is retained during the transmission of the encrypted data to the multiple users. The results indicated that the pre-authentication and attribute-conditional re-encryption framework improved the security levels significantly, by not revealing the users' identity and preventing other data recipients from accessing the data without authorization, while maintaining data sharing performance. As a result, the collaborative model offers a secure big data storage and data sharing model in the cloud that is efficient and offers privacy/security along with scalability."

    "abstract": "5G network slicing presents a transformative approach to deliver customizable, isolated virtual networks over shared infrastructure, tailored to meet diverse application requirements such as ultra-low latency, high reliability, or massive connectivity. However, orchestrating these network slices dynamically and efficiently remains a complex challenge due to the need for precise configuration, real-time responsiveness, and seamless coordination across heterogeneous domains (radio access network, core, and transport). In this paper, we present Slice-MCP, a novel 5G network slice orchestration platform that integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a fine-tuned Meta’s Llama-4 large language model (LLM) to simplify and automate the slice orchestration process. Slice-MCP allows users to invoke natural language queries which are interpreted by the fine-tuned LLM and mapped to the corresponding MCP functions to configure and deploy the appropriate network slices. To ensure accurate intent recognition and robust function mapping, the LLM was fine-tuned on a custom dataset comprising real-world user intents paired with their corresponding MCP server operations. The integration of MCP provides a standardized interface for dynamic context management, enabling a consistent and extensible way to translate high-level user goals into orchestrator-level instructions across network domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply the MCP for 5G network slice orchestration, merging AI-driven natural language interaction with telecom-grade infrastructure management. The effectiveness of the Slice-MCP is demonstrated through a real-world test-bed deployment in a sliced network scenario, utilizing multiple 5G cores (i.e., Open5GS) across Ericsson’s new RAN. Our results demonstrate that Slice-MCP significantly reduces the operational complexity of 5G slice management while enhancing responsiveness, scalability, and user accessibility."

    "abstract": "There is a lack of data recording in the event of an accident or theft, and the user cannot get assistance if their bike is in a remote place as emergency services cannot be contacted. No other means of entry to the bike exist other that key. The creation of a fingerprint-based, self-starting motorbike is the primary objective of this project. With this invention, the owner may just use his fingerprint to start his motorbike. Here, the owner can see exactly where their automobile is at all times and never lose a key again. Additionally, five of the owner's acquaintances will get a message with the exact position of the car in the event of an accident. If someone tries to steal the car, it will also sound an alarm. This project suggests an alternative identification method, namely, a system that detects accidents involving bikes and uses live GPS monitoring and authentication based on fingerprints. In order to combat vehicle theft and keep riders safe, this project details the development and deployment of a biometric smart bike security system. One of the main ways to verify your identity and start the engine is using a fingerprint sensor. The bike may only be started by authorized users using registered fingerprints; any attempt to start it by someone else would immediately raise an alarm for theft. In the event of an attempted intrusion, the owner will get real-time SMS alerts via a GSM module (SIM800L). A fuel cutoff device is built in to disable engine function and prevent tampering. It uses a relay to activate a solenoid valve, limiting fuel flow. The installation of a GPS module allows for more precise tracking by relaying the current position of the vehicle to the owner in the event of a theft. In addition, the ESP32 allows for real-time video streaming, which is useful for monitoring purposes and may serve as visual proof in the event of theft. An infrared (IR) sensor-based helmet detection system verifies that the rider is wearing a helmet before allowing them to operate the bike, hence enhancing rider safety. Biometric identification, Internet of Things (IoT) theft alerts, tracking by GPS, live streaming, as well as rider safety monitoring are all part of the suggested system, which is an affordable, dependable, and user-friendly solution for two-wheeler security."

However, sustaining long-term operations of battery-powered IoT devices remains a critical challenge due to the high energy cost of frequent data transmissions. Existing adaptive sampling techniques reduce energy consumption by limiting redundant transmissions but often rely on static heuristics that fail to adapt to dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for adaptive transmission scheduling that optimizes energy efficiency while preserving data integrity. We evaluate two RL strategies—Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN)—within a realistic simulation environment using the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) dataset. Our framework employs RL agents at dynamically selected cluster heads in a distributed urban IoT network, enabling intelligent transmission decisions based on residual energy and data similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-based policies significantly outperform heuristic baselines, with DQN achieving superior adaptability and faster convergence under changing conditions. Evaluated on the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) dataset using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), our system reduces recharge sessions by over 51% and improves unique data preservation by 31% compared to the baseline."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of contextual inconsistency and response delay in business English semantic translation in multimodal environments, this study proposes an immersive sign language interaction and multi-sensor fusion machine translation model (ISMF-COT) based on complex optimization constraints. This model constructs a dynamic context-aware semantic alignment structure. This innovation enables multi-layer fusion and adaptive semantic mapping of sign language, speech, and gesture signals. The model consists of two components: a nonlinear feature decomposition module based on the Kolmogorov–Arnold network (KAN), which achieves a unified latent space mapping of multimodal features; and a context-sensitive decoding mechanism based on the ContraTrans architecture. This module achieves collaborative modeling of linguistic and non-linguistic semantics through explicit and implicit attention layers. To overcome the gradient oscillation problem in non-convex multi-objective optimization, this paper further proposes a hierarchical dual collaborative optimization model (HDCO). This model achieves a nonlinear balance between the three objectives of the semantic consistency, interactive responsiveness, and translation accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we conducted a systematic experiment on the self-built Business-SL-Fusion dataset. This dataset contains three modalities: vision, audio, and action. A total of 12,000 samples. The experimental results show that ISMF-COT outperforms the mainstream control models in many indicators such as BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR. Among them, BLEU increased by 16.2%, ROUGE-L increased by 14.9%, and the average response delay decreased by 7.7%. Modal ablation experiments show that visual and audio features contribute most to semantic accuracy. Gesture features provide significant auxiliary information at the emotional and pragmatic levels. The complex optimization stability index (COS) increased by 0.11. This result verifies the stability of the model under non-convex optimization conditions."

In this case, four tumor types, such as glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor were classified by a CNN model trained on a VGG16 fine-tuned on this task. The downloaded kaggle dataset (7,023 MRI images) was balanced in terms of classes, and processed in a systematic manner before models were used to train. The architecture suggested was a combination of world average pooling, dense layers and dropout regularisation followed with warm-up training and refinement to optimal performance. The general accuracy of the model was 95 percent, whereas the classes had a precision, recall and F1-score of 0.91-0.99. The most correct was the class no tumor with 1.00 and then the glioma and meningioma with equal F1 scores of 0.93 and 0.91 respectively. Validation curves and training curves demonstrated stable convergence and no over-fitting, and confusion matrix also demonstrated that the misclassification number was smaller.

The demonstration highlights the effects of pulsed radar interference on key 5G metrics including UE throughput, uplink (UL) SINR, and downlink (DL) SNR, through live spectrum visualization and performance monitoring. Iterative test cycles allow systematic variation of radar parameters such as pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and duty cycles, fostering interactive discussions on practical coexistence scenarios.

Mitigation of crop damages and the promotion of sustainable agriculture, which eliminates the overuse of pesticides, hinges upon the identification of these diseases through the use of automation and advanced technology. This paper investigates the potential of the hybrid VGG19- Random Forest solution for identifying and classifying tomato diseases efficiently and accurately. The model was tested on the PlantVillage tomato dataset, which contains images of ten classes of diseases that are visually distinct and diverse. The VGG19 deep convolutional neural network was retrained to optimize feature extraction of diseased leaves, capturing textures and patterns associated with diseased leaf hierarchies. Global Average Pooling and Principal Component Analysis feature extraction optimizations reduced feature vector sizes, filtered noise and improved class separations of the dataset’s diseased tomato leaves. The Random Forest algorithm hierarchy was used to classify the features to improve the decision boundary and reduce overfitting normally associated with the use of CNN-Softmax classifiers.

But getting accurate lip syncing is a difficult job as per previous solutions due to several reasons, such as original audio with lip sync, speech with emotional expression for variety of languages. These systems also frequently struggle in less-than-ideal conditions, such as noisy environments, leading to noticeable synchronization failures that detract from the overall user experience. As per the survey- AI tools are less concurrent, in terms of audio and video data especially in the dubbing industry, virtual avatars disrupt the audience due to unnatural lip movements. These issues need to be addressed with all the existed limitations. To overcome these challenges, there is an urgent need for an advanced and scalable solution capable of generating high-quality, natural-looking lip-synced videos for digital brand promotions & interactions. Such a system must combine state-of-the-art models for speech synthesis, voice cloning, and lip synchronization, ensuring that audio and video not only match perfectly but also convey contextual and emotional appropriateness. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques and robust datasets, this proposed system can set a new standard in lip-sync technology, unlocking its potential for diverse applications, including virtual reality, interactive media, education, and beyond."

Despite their lightweight construction, small dimensions, and straightforward integration, microstrip patch antennas often struggle with limited bandwidth and reduced gain. We augment the conventional E-shaped structure with additional slots and optimize critical dimensions to address these issues. These alterations result in substantial improvements in impedance bandwidth and radiation efficiency. The engineered antenna functions well throughout the C-band frequency spectrum (2–8 GHz), providing improved return loss, elevated gain, and stable directional radiation patterns. The simulation findings confirm the antenna's efficacy for satellite communication, offering a high-performance, low-profile option. Furthermore, the antenna design is economically viable and straightforward to manufacture, making it suitable for contemporary satellite systems."

    "abstract": "While diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated promising results, they still face critical limitations in practical medical imaging applications. Recent methods focus on training on real-world image datasets, but these methods are prone to losing structural information when transferred to the medical imaging domain and suffer from extremely slow inference speed. Traditional diffusion-based super-resolution models in medical imaging face key challenges including image structure inconsistency, low computational efficiency, and unstable training. To address these issues, we propose FMSRdiff, an efficient latent diffusion framework that integrates consistency models with optical flow matching. Starting with latent space diffusion, we construct an efficient low-dimensional representation learning framework. This allows the diffusion process to be performed in a compressed latent space, significantly reducing computational complexity and memory requirements while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. We then design a two-stage training strategy that first learns stable noise prediction capabilities through optical flow matching, then switches to consistent model training to achieve a direct mapping from noisy to clean latent representations. This strategy not only ensures training stability but also significantly improves inference speed, reducing the 50-100 sampling steps required in traditional diffusion models to just one, significantly improving the model’s practicality. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical diffusion mechanism to achieve multi-scale feature processing from coarse to fine scales, effectively addressing the structural inconsistency problem in medical image super-resolution. Through cross-scale feature fusion and conditional guidance, the model better preserves the global structure and local details of the image, resulting in more natural and realistic super-resolution results. Experiments on the IXI and BRATS datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 30% improvement in SSIM scores compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for medical imaging data. Through latent space diffusion, computational efficiency is increased by approximately 16 times, memory usage is significantly reduced."

    "abstract": "Vegetation, as a critical ecological feature and irreplaceable material resource of the Earth's surface, plays a crucial role in environmental protection, resource assessment and urban planning. The rapid advancement of remote sensing platforms and sensor technologies has facilitated the acquisition of high-resolution remote sensing imagery, providing excellent conditions for the detailed analysis of vegetation. However, vegetation segmentation in remote sensing imagery poses distinct challenges, including extreme scale variance, spectral ambiguity and complex boundary characteristics. The performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods in vegetation segmentation is constrained by their limited ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In contrast, although Transformer-based architectures effective at capturing global context, their quadratic complexity makes them impractical for processing high-resolution remote sensing images. Recently, State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising alternative owing to their linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling capabilities. Nevertheless, existing vision SSMs have two critical limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of boundary information; and (2) the limited performance improvements offered by multi-directional scanning strategies while increasing computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose BRSMamba, a boundary-aware network that integrates two novel modules with Non-Causal State-Space Duality (NC-SSD) to enhance both boundary preservation and global context modeling. Specifically, the Boundary-Subject Fusion Perception (BFP) module extracts robust boundary features via a Laplacian-of-Gaussian Convolutional Block (LCB) and fuses them with category-centric semantics to generate a boundary-subject map. This map then directs the Boundary-Body Resolution (BBR) module to inject boundary awareness into the NC-SSD state-transition matrix, enabling selective scanning that preserves fine details and captures long-range dependencies. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrated that BRSMamba achieved 78.86% mIoU on Vaihingen, 82.84% on Potsdam, 54.37% on LoveDA, and 72.24% on GID while using only 10.61 M parameters and 26.28 G FLOPs. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in balancing the accuracy and efficiency of complex vegetation segmentation tasks."

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) is crucial for real-time high-precision positioning in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Deep learning methods are capable of effectively capturing the complex temporal patterns of ZTD time series, which in turn contributes to improved its prediction accuracy and faster convergence in Precise Point Positioning (PPP). However, existing models generally suffer from insufficient temporal resolution, limited generalization ability, and reliance on latitude-based station division, which fails to comprehensively reflect the global error distribution characteristics. To this end, we develop a novel ZTD Forecasting model based on PatchTST (PBZTD), which more effectively captures local dependencies in time series by segmenting the ZTD data into patches. Meanwhile, the GNSS stations are categorized into five major climate types based on the Köppen-Geiger climate classification: Equatorial, Drought, Temperate, Frigid, and Polar. Three prediction schemes were analyzed to compare the performance of different models PBZTD, Informer-based ZTD, and LSTM-based ZTD), using data from 189 ZTD stations provided by the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory across five global climate types from 2012 to 2023. Additionally, the prediction results serve as external constraints in PPP to further evaluate the reliability of the proposed PBZTD model. The results reveal that ZTD prediction accuracy varies across different climate types, with the highest and lowest accuracy observed in polar and equatorial types, showing average RMSEs of 15.54 mm and 25.05 mm, respectively. The PBZTD outperforms IBZTD and LBZTD, with average accuracy improvements of 2.40% and 34.50%, respectively across five climate types. In addition, PBZTD demonstrates superior generalization ability, achieving improvements of 4.20% and 34.27% on 25 stations that were not involved in the model training. Moreover, the incorporation of PBZTD prediction results into PPP leads to faster convergence, achieving average improvements of 15.4%, 9.42%, and 26.51% in the E, N, and U directions, respectively."

    "abstract": "Generative latent variable models (GLVMs) are prevalent in developing soft sensors for predicting industrial process quality indices owing to their exceptional capability in extracting features, reducing data dimensionality, and explaining data generation mechanisms. Dynamical GLVMs (DGLVMs) are able to effectively deal with the dynamical characteristics of industrial data changes over time, exhibiting prominence in time-series prediction and dynamical process modeling. However, the existing DGLVM-based soft sensors share an intrinsic imperfection that they focus on capturing the temporal correlations between variables while disregarding the causal relationships between variables. Based on industrial data, it is difficult to recover the causalities between variables from the correlations, resulting in compromised generalization performance of the existing DGLVM-based soft sensors. In light of this limitation, a novel causal knowledge-assisted semi-supervised DGLVM (CK-SsDGLVM) is proposed, and an ad hoc parameter learning method based on the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to train the CK-SsDGLVM. The performance of the CK-SsDGLVM is comprehensively evaluated using an artificial numerical case and an actual industrial process. The experimental results demonstrate that the CK-SsDGLVM could achieve superior generalization accuracy and interpretability compared to benchmark models."

    "abstract": "In Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) insulation, the non-linear nature of volumetric current - time characteristics were often attributed to its complex space charge dynamics, apart from temperature and electric field dependence. However, a scanty attention is given to the measurement related issues of volumetric current in the literature. In this paper, the authors have presented experiments conducted on measuring circuits used in electrometer as well as with the commercial electrometer, to investigate the measurement related aspects on the current characteristics of LDPE. Matching the time constants of measuring circuit impedance with the dielectric under test, would typically offset all the errors of the measurement. However, LDPE with the non-linear variation of its impedance characteristics, makes it difficult for accurate measurement, as it dynamically deviates from the fixed time constant of the measuring circuit impedance. Hence, the true volumetric current characteristics and a novel circuit model for the impedance of LDPE are proposed. Interestingly, they are observed to corroborate well with the Transient Space Charge Limited Current (TSLC) theory."

However, the absence of high-precision microscopic DFF datasets and the significant differences between existing DFF datasets and microscopic DFF data in optical design, imaging principles and scene characteristics hinder the performance of current DFF models in microscopic tasks. To address this, we introduce M3D, a novel microscopic DFF dataset, constructed using a self-developed microscopic device. It includes multi-focus image sequences of 1,952 scenes across five categories, with depth labels obtained through the 3D TFT algorithm applied to dense image sequences for initial depth estimation and calibration. All labels are then compared and analyzed against the design values, and those with large errors are eliminated. We also propose M3DNet, a frequency-aware end-to-end network, to tackle challenges like shallow depth-of-field (DoF) and weak textures. Results show that M3D compensates for the limitations of macroscopic DFF datasets and extends DFF applications to microscopic scenarios. M3DNet effectively captures rapid focus decay and improves performance on public DFF datasets by leveraging superior global feature extraction. Additionally, it exhibits strong robustness even in extreme conditions. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/jiangfeng-Z/M3D."

We provide a structured overview of HAPS subsystems and principal communication links, map cybersecurity and privacy exposure across communication, control, and power subsystems, and propose a stratosphere-aware threat taxonomy. The stratospheric operating regime imposes unique constraints–wide temperature cycling, radiation-induced soft errors, long-duration autonomy with intermittent backhaul, limited physical access, and heterogeneous RF/FSO links–that shape both the attack surface and the feasibility of defenses. We foreground these constraints to motivate design choices and scope realistic mitigations. We then discuss defenses feasible under HAPS constraints–including encryption and authentication, frequency agility, directional and beam-steered antennas, intrusion detection, secure boot, and software and supply-chain assurance–while highlighting how they align with emerging regulatory and standards guidance. Finally, we report a simulation-based case study using OMNeT++/INET to characterize distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) impact on service-and control-plane availability, and summarize regulatory and standardization considerations relevant to deployment. We conclude with concrete future research directions. The study is simulation-grounded and intended to inform engineering trade-offs for real-world HAPS deployments rather than serve as an on-air validation."

    "abstract": "The energy management system (EMS) of fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs) significantly affects their operational costs, and its performance is closely related to driving speed. Passenger numbers impact the stop time between stations, providing foresight for speed planning. Additionally, maintaining a stable driving speed helps reduce overall energy consumption and power fluctuations, thus extending the lifespan of the fuel cell. Therefore, this paper proposes a learning-based EMS for FCEBs, which integrates speed planning that accounts for passenger flow prediction and speed stability, improving overall vehicle performance through optimized weight coefficients. The study consists of three main parts: 1) predicting passenger flow based on weather, temperature, time, and holidays, and estimating stop times; 2) planning speed with a focus on punctuality and passenger comfort, while minimizing red light waiting time to reduce frequent stop-start cycles; 3) performing multi-objective optimization weight learning, considering passenger flow prediction and speed planning. The planned speed curve is categorized into three driving modes: acceleration, steady-state, and deceleration. The weight coefficients are learned based on the power requirements in these modes, improving the overall system performance. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm in passenger flow prediction, punctuality, and EMS performance optimization. This approach significantly enhances passenger trust in public transportation while reducing bus operation costs."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-induced vaporization of perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanodroplets can be used for triggered drug delivery. Nanodroplets of perfluorobutane (PFB) and perfluoropentane (PFP) can vaporize spontaneously at physiological temperature, which can cause off-target effects. Using high-boiling-point PFCs, such as perfluorohexane (PFH), can overcome this limitation. However, PFH requires higher peak negative pressures for vaporization, making its <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> use challenging. We investigated the feasibility of reducing the vaporization pressure threshold by gold-coating lipid-encapsulated PFH nanodroplets (Au-PFH-ND). We synthesized PFH nanodroplets, and the gold-coating was confirmed by UV-visible spectra. The mass of gold per nanodroplet was 5.12×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup> pg.

Ultrasound imaging <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vitro</i> was used to determine the pressure threshold for nanodroplet vaporization upon exposure to 2 MHz ultrasound. The vaporization threshold for Au-PFH-ND (3.29 ± 0.93 MPa) was significantly lower than uncoated PFH nanodroplets (PFH-ND, 6.19 ± 1.25 MPa). Au-PFH-ND had a similar pressure threshold to uncoated PFP nanodroplets (PFP-ND, 2.81 ± 1.08 MPa). These findings show that the Au-PFH-ND can be vaporized at a similar ultrasound pressure as PFP-ND. Increasing pulse duration from 2 to 60 cycles enhanced vaporization of Au-PFH-ND, demonstrating the dominant role of a thermal mechanism. Even when accounting for the total ultrasound on-time and effective peak negative pressure, longer bursts (i.e., more cycles per burst) were more effective in inducing vaporization, consistent with the role of localized heating around the gold coating rather than a purely probabilistic effect. Additionally, inertial and stable cavitation emissions were quantified. Au-PFH-ND exhibited a marginally lower inertial cavitation threshold and similar second harmonic emissions than PFH-ND, suggesting that cavitation could also have played a role in reducing the pressure threshold. These findings are a step towards employing gold-coated PFC nanodroplets for multimodal drug delivery."

NAs are groups of Network Services (NSs) that provide functionalities for verticals. They have been pivotal in domains like enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and Internet of Everything (IoE), and their importance will only grow as we transition further into 6G. Therefore, understanding and addressing the challenges and opportunities posed by NAs are crucial as we advance towards 6G. This article proposes an approach for designing and onboarding secure and private NAs, ensuring their compliance with policies in closed loops (e.g., Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) loops). The introduced architecture leverages OpenSlice and incorporates best practices from DevOps with SecOps and PrivOps (DevPrivSecOps). These NAs are designed to be configurable both at the time of ordering and during runtime, with predefined characteristics that can be adjusted, for example, through Moving Target Defense (MTD) mechanisms. Furthermore, the definitions for privacy quantification services and their configuration are introduced to determine the privacy and risk scores of NAs, feeding the loop continuously. At a high level, security and privacy policies can be manually defined, or automatically generated in response to malicious attacks, and they can be dynamically translated and enforced within existing NAs. The early results show that the approach is sound, with promising results from the Proof of Concept (PoC) and custom-built tooling."

These challenges are critical barriers to achieving seamless global communication and supporting applications such as emergency response, smart infrastructure, and industrial automation, where robust connectivity directly impacts safety, operational efficiency, and societal resilience. To this end, we propose a UAV-enabled Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) framework, in which UAVs operate as adaptive relays between low-earth-orbit satellites and user terminals. Our system leverages altitude-optimized UAV placement and environment-aware channel modeling, incorporating realistic ionospheric, atmospheric, multipath, and fading effects to dynamically mitigate propagation losses and optimize link reliability. We validate our approach using the NVIDIA Sionna simulator by conducting experiments across diverse environments and disaster-response scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SAGIN framework achieves a 91.7% improvement in downlink throughput compared to baseline D2C model, with a graceful degradation of 12ms end-to-end latency."

The original power consumption trajectory of the feedforward neural network module was collected. It was found that there was an obvious power consumption peak in the output of this module. Therefore, we implemented the output obfuscation technology for this module and collected the protected power consumption trajectory. The verification is based on an FPGA development board xc7k160tfbg676-1 to design and verify the transformer encoder with a token of 64 and a word embedding dimension of 512. The verification results show that the usage of digital signal processing (DSP) is 552, and logic Look-Up Tables (LUT) is 96,043. In this experiment, the model’s data is quantized to 16-bit signed fixed-point numbers, with the number of decimal places varying according to different modules. A compensation coefficient is added to the matrix multiplication and a module design method of divide-and-add is adopted. The average error of the hardware implementation compared to software calculation is 0.000867, and the execution time at 200 MHz is 8.6837 ms, which is 1.657 times faster, saving approximately 39.7% of the execution time."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new class of Physical Layer Security (PLS) algorithms optimized for high-mobility in 6G networks. Fast-moving mobiles severely challenge the reliability and security of wireless networks. To ensure reliable and secure data transmission in high-mobility, the paper introduces a shared secret key PLS scheme that operates in Delay-Doppler domain. The scheme integrates shared key, precoding-based PLS and Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) for robust shared secret key generation and secure data transmission at low-latency and high-mobility. This synergy represents a significant advancement for secure 6G Layer-1 communication and can overcome the long-standing limitations of prior PLS schemes sensitive to high-velocity environments. The paper formulates a shared key-based PLS for OTFS (SK-PLS-OTFS) framework, develops bit error rate (BER) models, simulates system performance under high-mobility versus signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions, and discusses latency and computational complexity of the model. The algorithm enables hyper reliable and low-latency communication (HRLLC) for emerging 6G use cases like high speed 6G-connected vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. The results show resilient security performance even for extreme-velocities over 400 km/h and prove that the SK-PLS-OTFS model operates securely and reliably across a range of highly-mobile systems in terrestrial and non-terrestrial scenarios."

These models, which learn unified representations from diverse, large-scale datasets, have transformed domains such as language, vision, and biology. However, RF signal processing systems have yet to fully benefit from this paradigm shift. Traditional approaches remain focused on closed-set, single-task objectives such as automatic modulation classification or emitter identification, limiting adaptability in dynamic scenarios that demand flexible, general-purpose reasoning across unseen waveforms and channel conditions. In this work, we introduce SemanticRF, a foundation model for RF scene analysis trained via multimodal contrastive learning to produce a unified signal-text embedding. Pretrained on a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning diverse modulation types, SNRs, and channel models, SemanticRF delivers strong performance on traditional RFML benchmarks but also demonstrates strong generalization to novel tasks such as RF scene tagging, highlighting a step towards adaptable foundation models in the RF domain."

The proposed solution employs a PLL feedback loop and an on-time generation module to compensate for input/output voltage variations, ensuring a stable switching frequency under changing load and input/output voltage conditions. To significantly enhance the frequency locking speed during the transition from light-load Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) to heavy-load Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), an adaptive frequency-following charge pump clamp circuit is designed. The Buck converter was simulated and verified using a $\\mathbf{0. 1 8} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m ~ B C D}$ process. Experimental results show that, with an input voltage of 12 V, an output voltage of 3.3 V, and a set frequency of 1 MHz, the use of the adaptive clamp circuit reduces the frequency locking time from $\\mathbf{2 5 0} \\mu$ s to $\\mathbf{1 1 8} \\mu$ s, representing a $\\mathbf{5 2. 8 \\%}$ improvement in locking speed.

Although LLMs such as GPT and BERT can be quite strong language generators, they tend to fail and have problems in factual reasoning, entity disambiguation, and multi-hop inference because they have very weak structured knowledge. To overcome these shortcomings, a hybrid architecture was developed combining structured knowledge of Knowledge Graphs with transformer based Embeddings of LLM using embedding alignment, contextual fusion and attention-based reasoning. Several benchmark datasets, quantitative metrics, such as, perplexity, contextual coherence, semantic similarity, and reasoning accuracy, and visual analyses, such as, accuracy trends, confusion matrices, and embedding projections, were used to evaluate the model. The findings showed that the hybrid model was much more effective at contextual understanding, semantic ambiguity, and reasoning interpretability than the base LLMs. The results show that Knowledge Graph integration is semantically grounded, can enhance representational consistency, and can support human-like reasoning, which can be used to present a strong framework of explainable and context-aware AI systems."

Scoring solutions, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), often fail to account for the contextual awareness of an environment, including system configurations, interconnected dependencies, and physical access risks, leading to suboptimal remediation strategies. In this paper, we present TRACER (Threat Resilience Assessment for Cyber Evaluation Readiness), a new framework that quantifies a resiliency score against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) by integrating cyber vulnerabilities and physical risk into a unified, graph-based model. Our approach dynamically evaluates the ratio of vulnerable paths to the total number of paths in an environment across cyber and physical domains. The results of our work demonstrate the adaptability of TRACER throughout environmental changes, and our graph-based model provides remediation strategies through software patching and strengthened physical security to improve the resiliency of an environment against APTs."

The proposed approach demonstrates that the performance of these waveforms depends on the ability of the demodulation matrix to whiten the noise–a property that is, in turn, related to the sparsity of the matrix. AFDM is shown to outperform OTFS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as its demodulation matrix is generally less sparse than those of the other waveforms. Based on this analysis, several application examples and use cases are presented, such as the use of AFDM and OTFS in narrowband signals or in coexistence with OFDM signals. Finally, simulation results confirm that AFDM achieves better performance than OTFS and OFDM in the presence of non-white noise, with gains exceeding 1 dB in most application scenarios."

    "abstract": "As the cyber threats increase in complexity and frequency, the defect reactive and rule-based approaches have given insufficient results for securing the crucial digital infrastructures. The experts provide a detailed review of the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based forensic devices developed to improve the real-time threat mitigation and anomaly identification across various cybersecurity environments. The research starts by assessing the wide region of cybersecurity, highlighting the requirement for adaptive learning, continuous monitoring and scalable defense models regardless of insider threats, zero-day exploits and polymorphic attacks. Further, it narrows the concentration to the integration of AI in digital forensics, where deep learning techniques are leveraged to categorize the anomalous behavior, recognize intrusion patterns and predict future attack factors. This work presents a digital forensic investigation approach that has evolved into a multifaceted discipline, requiring the integration of diverse analytical methods to effectively investigate cyber incidents. This is a unified analytical framework that holistically analyzes digital assets by integrating three distinct investigation domains, such as email author attribution with email body contextual analysis, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) classification, and network traffic analysis. The framework is designed as a sequential pipeline, dynamically interconnected, with each stage enhancing the subsequent one through feedback loops and behavioral correlation. In the first stage, the email author attribution for forensic purposes is done using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and model-based clustering, and then the contextual forensic analysis of emails based on the email body is done using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Emails with suspicious links initiate the second stage of the process, where the URL classification is carried out using the Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), which effectively detects the malicious activities through this classified URL. Detected malicious URLs inform and direct the targeted monitoring during the third stage, where the network traffic is examined. In this stage, intrusion detection and network packet classification are executed using a Coordinate Attention-based Gated Recurrent Unit (CA-GRU) model, allowing for robust intrusion detection in modern, privacy-preserving communication systems. The developed framework is adaptable, evolving with emerging threats and scalable for diverse use cases, making it an essential tool for both small-scale and enterprise-level forensic investigations. Finally, experimental validation is done to ensure the effectiveness of the developed model in cyber investigations."

One of the key considerations for supporting such XR applications is intelligent and adaptive resource allocation with edge offloading. To address these demands, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation framework that dynamically allocates uplink and downlink slots while making offloading decisions based on the XR headset’s capabilities and network conditions. The paper presents a numerical analysis of the tradeoff between frame loss rate (FLR) and energy efficiency, identifying decision regions for partial offloading to optimize performance. Results show that for the used set of system parameters, partial offloading can extend the coverage area by 55% and reduce energy consumption by up to 34%, compared to always or never offloading. The results demonstrate that the headset’s local computing capability plays a crucial role in offloading decisions. Higher computing abilities enable more efficient local processing, reduce the need for offloading, and enhance energy savings."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior. Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering performance.To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation (RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime and memory overhead."

    "abstract": "In India, two-wheelers are the most widely used mode of transportation. With the rapid increase in population, the number of two-wheelers on the road has also grown significantly. However, the safety measures available for two-wheelers are comparatively limited when compared to four-wheelers, which are equipped with advanced protection systems such as airbags. For most two-wheeler riders, the primary safety measures are wearing a helmet and using GPS for tracking. One major safety concern in two-wheelers is the side stand issue. If a rider forgets to retract the side stand before riding, it can lead to loss of balance during turning and may result in serious accidents. In recent years (especially in BS6 model vehicles), manufacturers have started providing built-in side stand indicators or side stand engine cut-off systems to prevent such accidents. However, a large number of two-wheelers manufactured before the Bharath stage 6 (BS6) era do not include any side stand safety mechanism. Statistics show that: About 95% of two-wheelers manufactured before 2000 lack a side stand safety system. Around 70% of two-wheelers produced between 2000–2015 do not have this feature. Even among recent models, 10–15% of vehicles manufactured between 2018–2020 still lack a proper side stand safety system. These figures highlight the need for additional safety solutions, especially for the large number of older vehicles still in use. To address this issue, this work proposes an IoT-based low-cost automatic side stand safety system that can be easily installed on existing bikes. The system is integrated with the ignition mechanism, ensuring that the bike will not start unless the side stand is fully retracted, thereby preventing accidents caused by riding with the side stand down. The overall implementation cost is estimated to be around Rs. 2000 to 2500 when the system is integrated into the bike."

    "abstract": "Traditional cryptographic methods ensure data confidentiality through sophisticated and complex key management and encryption protocols. However, such approaches may be ill-suited for scenarios with limited coordination capabilities, such as military communications or the Internet of Things (IoT); Physical Layer Encryption (PLE) then offers a complementary or alternative solution by securing information directly at the signal level. Among existing PLE techniques, masking strategies have shown considerable promise. Nonetheless, many of these techniques suffer from drawbacks such as high Peak-To-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), rely on the eavesdropper’s channel knowledge, or lack of adaptability to diverse wireless environments. In this paper, we propose a novel PLE technique that overcomes these limitations. Our approach achieves optimal PAPR by design, requires no knowledge of the eavesdropper’s channel state information, and is applicable to all flat fading channels. Additionally, the method incorporates continuous randomization in signal generation, enhancing resistance to brute-force attacks. These features collectively make our solution a robust and practical candidate for secure wireless communication at the physical layer. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach under various channel conditions."

This survey systematically reviews and critically evaluates existing methods for forecasting irregular time series. We primarily focus on cutting-edge deep sequential modeling approaches, which have demonstrated superior performance and innovative solutions to these challenges. We propose a clear classification framework that categorizes current approaches into two main groups: traditional statistical and machine learning methods and deep sequential modeling methods.

For each category, this paper elaborates on representative models, providing an in-depth analysis of their core principles, technological evolution, and respective advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, we discuss the major challenges in this research area and outline promising future research directions.

An AIGaN/GaN HEMT structure with an InGaN back-barrier layer is designed and optimized. Its electrical characteristics are verified via simulation. A two-stage topology is adopted for the converter, comprising an interleaved totem-pole PFC (Power Factor Correction) and an LLC resonant converter. The operating principle of this topology is analyzed in detail, and the key circuit parameters are carefully designed. Under 220 V AC input, the converter achieves a rated output power of 2400 W, a DC bus voltage of $400 \\mathrm{~V} \\pm 5 \\%$, a peak efficiency of 97.03%, and a power factor (PF) of $\\geqslant 0.999$. All these performance metrics fully meet the requirements of highend server power supplies, which demonstrates that GaN technology possesses the capability to overcome the inherent efficiency-density trade-off in traditional power supply designs."

This paper investigates the feasibility of using standardized Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) to detect UAVs in Urban Micro (UMi) and Urban Macro (UMa) propagation environments. A full 5GNR radar processing chain is implemented, including clutter suppression, angle and range estimation, and 3D position reconstruction. Simulation results show that performance strongly depends on the propagation environment. 5GNR radars exhibits the highest missed detection rate, up to 16%, in UMi, due to severe clutter. Positioning error increases with target distance, resulting in larger errors in UMa scenarios and at higher UAV altitudes. In particular, the system achieves a position error within 4m in the UMi environment and within 8m in UMa. The simulation platform has been released as open-source software to support reproducible research in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems."

This paper presents SAJD – a self-adaptive jammer detection framework that autonomously detects jamming attacks in AI/ML framework-integrated ORAN environments without human intervention. The SAJD framework forms a closed-loop system that includes near-real-time inference of radio signal jamming via our developed ML-based xApp, as well as continuous monitoring and retraining pipelines through rApps.

    "abstract": "Covert battlefield communication is crucial for modern military operations, yet traditional radio frequency methods are easily susceptible to detection. This paper investigates a novel approach for low-probability of detection (LPD) communication by embedding data in the polarization of light using a chiral fluid. We demonstrate that varying the path length of light through a chiral fluid allows for controlled rotation of the light’s polarization based on specific rotation principles. This rotation can be detected as changes in received intensity when using linear polarizers, as predicted by Malus’ Law, or as subtle shifts in color when employing a white light source and a commodity digital camera with a polarizing filter. Modulating the fluid level allows for the encoding of rudimentary bit patterns. Additionally, utilizing a generic white LED as the light source with polarizers, discernible color shifts were observed with changes in the sucrose solution’s path length, offering an alternative data encoding method. This technique holds promise for field-expedient LPD communication, potentially leveraging readily available light sources and cameras. An illustrative demonstration was conducted using an LED lamp, soda, and cell phone sending data symbols 15 m between adjacent rooms. In this experiment, it was seen that color shift caused by the chiral fluid, as received by a commodity CMOS sensor, was even more robust than measuring intensity alone."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of artificial intelligence and edge intelligence, link prediction technology can provide more robust support and optimization in edge intelligence, thereby enhancing the performance of real-world applications and reduce the costs. However, traditional link prediction models often focus on learning general embedding features of nodes while neglecting the direction of the links. Therefore, based on graph autoencoder (GAE), a link prediction model using graph representation called DGAAE, is proposed to estimate the communication connectivity requirements for the devices in Internet of Things (IoT). Firstly, two encoders are employed to encode directions of links as one of the features so as to embed source and target nodes and acquire the representation for link tendencies. Secondly, a dot-product attention is introduced during the encoding process to capture the structure information to improve the accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DGAAE outperforms baseline methods in link prediction tasks on the IoT dataset of INT and other real datasets, which contributes to reducing the computation and routing costs for IoT applications, such as intelligent transportation and routing networks, by improving the prediction accuracy at the edge."

This work addresses this challenge by suggesting an AI-powered Smart Curriculum Mapping system based on integrating AR/VR immersive learning environments with state-of-the-art student behavior analytics. The system collects multimodal information such as gaze movements, gesture, interaction measures, and performance records and utilizes Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) to extract latent cognitive and engagement features from it. These eventually feed into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based reinforcement learning engine to dynamically optimize learning paths through selection of content modules, interaction modes, and difficulty levels in real time. Adaptive high-fidelity AR/VR interfaces are engineered to change experiential scenarios adaptively to improve engagement and comprehension. Teachers leverage an AI-powered dashboard to observe predictive engagement, cognitive overload, and knowledge retention. The novelty lies in interconnecting DBN-based feature modeling and DQN-based adaptive policy learning with immersive AR/VR technology to achieve highly personalized data-driven education with optimized academic performance and metacognitive development."

In this paper, we propose a Software-Defined Network (SDN) architecture to mitigate DrDoS attacks, exemplifying with DNS reflection attacks. Our approach leverages SDN’s centralized control and programmability to dynamically monitor and create flow rules to manage the traffic in the network, allowing response traffic for a specified time slot for a prior request. We use game theory to analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution and optimize its performance in attack mitigation. We show that the proposed approach can reduce the impact of the attack and increase the cost for the attacker while minimizing the overhead for the defender over time."

The package structure is modeled and simulated in ANSYS based on the finite element analysis. The influences of graphite thickness on the thermal resistance and junction temperature are discussed. The results demonstrate that the optimization effect of thermal reliability will gradually decrease. When compared to conventional DSC package structure, the proposed graphite-molybdenum enhanced DSC package structure enables a 21.6% reduction of the junction temperature and a 31.5% reduction of the thermal resistance.

To address these limitations, a novel IoT integrated federated deep learning framework for real time stroke monitoring and detection is proposed in this study. The system detects a stroke-related facial palsy to high diagnostic accuracy with minimal and unobtrusive human intervention through automatic recognition using YOLOv8. Federated Learning (FL), a method that ensures that data privacy is preserved while performance and generalization remain unaffected, is adopted to ensure that the models are trained in a decentralized manner across the healthcare nodes that are connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). The framework, which is realized on Nvidia GPU-accelerated platforms, offers the fast computation and real-time responsiveness which are essential in emergency situations. Aided stroke detection, privacy-preserving distributed learning, continuous Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring and scalable low latency deployment represent selected major contributions. The proposed system will be a next-generation privacy-integrated diagnostic system that has higher accuracy and enhances data security and faster medical responses through combining FL, IoT sensing and AI-based analytics. Armed with intelligent tools, VETNHA creates effective real-time decision support for doctors to reach patients at the optimal time, significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing the prevalence of neurological disorders across the globe."

The present paper presents an automated traffic control system with LoRa-powered Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to make the process of ambulance navigation and emergency response faster and more efficient in smart cities. The suggested system consists of IoT sensors, PIC microcontroller, and GPS to detect accidents and accurately determine positioning. When an accident is located, the system will automatically dispatch an ambulance by use of a GSM/IoT interface and send the benefit of the incident to nearby hospitals using LoRa technology. Simultaneously, a monitoring unit which can be an ambulance is installed with biomedical sensors that can read vital parameters like heart rate, blood pressure and temperature and post them on the Thing Speak Cloud so that medical personnel can monitor the patient live. The LoRa-based coordination with the traffic lights dynamically clears the road by the emergency vehicles reducing the time it spends on traveling. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the system can greatly decrease response time, improve communication between the emergency stakeholders, and increase the rate of patient survival. The suggested integrated IoT/ Lorca communication system is a low-power, scalable and cost-effective model that can be used in implementing smart transportation and health care infrastructure within urban contexts."

In this work, we introduce SPEAK (Secure PUF-Enabled Authentication and Key-Exchange), a novel protocol leveraging TRNG-powered random obfuscation and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) to achieve efficient key exchange and built-in authentication without the need for conventional encryption or hashing. We detail the implementation of SPEAK on an ESP32-C3 microcontroller, utilizing a 128-bit XOR-2 MemPUF, and evaluate its practical deployment over MQTT. Our security analysis demonstrates SPEAK’s resilience against a range of attack vectors, including replay attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and denial of service attacks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive machine learning-based modeling attacks, including those employing CMA-ES metaheuristics, and show that SPEAK maintains robust security against such adversaries. Experimental results reveal that SPEAK achieves significantly lower latency and improved throughput compared to SSL/TLS-based solutions, while remaining well-suited for ultra-lightweight IoT endpoints. These findings position SPEAK as a practical and scalable protocol for secure communication in next-generation IoT environments."

    "abstract": "In this research, a sign-based narrative platform is being proposed, which will improve the accessibility of hearing-impaired children by automatically animating and narrating in American Sign Language (ASL) and audio. The system can transform text in as much as it can be translated into synchronized audio and visual forms in a combination of multilingual translation, ASL gloss mapping, and image-based sign retrieval. The usability testing of the system was performed on 20 participants, consisting of children and educators in inclusive classrooms to prove that the system is effective. Findings have shown a 35 per cent growth in the comprehension scores and 42 per cent increase in engagement as compared to the text alone story presentations. Real time performance on standard hardware is tested by technical assessment and it has an average frame rendering latency of 0.18s. The results show that cheap AI-driven storytelling tools can be of great use in mitigating communication obstacles during early stages of education. The future work will extend grammar-conscious ASL synthesis and dynamic gestures of avatars to enhance the expressiveness."

The use of deep learning in concrete mixture design is expanding rapidly; it can solve complicated issues on its own and has revolutionary potential. In this study, the compressive power of concrete at 28 days of age was predicted using a comparative analysis using the deep learning algorithm of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to forecast the compressive power and water absorption ratio in cement mixture. The dataset was produced under a number of carefully monitored circumstances in a laboratory. The approaches of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient’s determination (R2) were recycled to validate the proposed CNN model and the outcomes showed that the CNN prototype model accurately predicts the compressive power of the concrete ratio"

An out-of-phase feedback transformer is employed for wideband input matching. Building on this, the trade-off between impedance matching and transconductance in the input network is optimized, with carefully chosen coupling coefficients to further enhance performance. A current-reuse technique is incorporated to improve gain while minimizing power consumption. Additionally, a gate-drain feedback transformer is utilized in the output load to broaden the bandwidth. Post-simulation results show that the proposed LNA achieves a maximum gain of 16.2 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of $62.8-85.7 \\mathrm{GHz}(22.9 \\mathrm{GHz})$. The noise figure (NF) ranges from 3.3 to 4.5 dB, with an $\\mathrm{IP}_{1 \\mathrm{~dB}}$ of -25.5 dBm at 79.9 GHz.

    "abstract": "The scarcity of high-quality millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio frequency (RF) data for human sensing poses significant challenges to the generalization and robustness of deep learning models in this domain. The acquisition of RF data is constrained by the need for specialized equipment and specific application scenarios, resulting in a significant gap in both quantity and diversity compared to visual data. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose PODM-mmHPE, a novel framework that leverages Physical Optics (PO) and Diffusion Models (DM) to synthesize high-quality human RF data for mmWave Human Pose Estimation (mmHPE). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a PO-based RF simulation pipeline that generates coarse RF data from 3D human mesh models by modeling electromagnetic wave interactions with body surface geometry and (2) a DM-based refinement module that transforms the coarse data into realistic RF heatmaps, capturing the complexity and noise of real-world RF signals. Furthermore, we develop map2pose, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based model that establishes an end-to-end mapping from RF heatmaps to 3D human poses, serving both as a downstream task benchmark and a validation mechanism for the quality of our synthetic data. Experiments demonstrate PODM-mmHPE’s effectiveness with 23.9% and 25.1% MPJPE reductions on HuPR and mmHPE datasets under synthetic augmentation. This validates our physics-guided synthesis enables generalizable mmWave pose estimation."

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sixth-generation (6G) networks is a foundational requirement for achieving unprecedented performance, but it also introduces a sophisticated threat landscape that legacy security frameworks cannot address. This paper presents a comprehensive review of this dual role of AI, analyzing its potential to both compromise and safeguard future networks. Since AI has the ability to both protect and compromise security and privacy, its implementation with 6G technology may sometimes be a double-edged sword. The primary objective of this survey is to systematically analyze existing research that integrates AI techniques into 6G architectures, focusing on their implications for security and privacy. Among the concerns being investigated is the fundamental privacy and security risk associated with 6G technologies. Therefore, in order to incorporate and confirm this foundational research as a platform for future research, we have developed a review on the specifics of 6G security and privacy. The methodology involves reviewing recent academic and industrial studies related to AI-enabled 6G frameworks, threat models, and defense mechanisms, with an emphasis on how AI contributes to intrusion detection, authentication, and privacy preservation. This paper begins with a historical analysis of previous networking technologies and how they impacted contemporary 6G networking improvements. Therefore, this article discusses extensively the aspects that have rendered 6G technology relevant as well as the ongoing 6G-based projects. In addition, it identifies and critically evaluates key enabling technologies, including distributed ledger technology (DLT/blockchain), physical layer security (PLS), terahertz (THz) communication, quantum computing, visible light communication (VLC), and distributed AI/ML, that underpin secure 6G environments. The paper concludes by summarizing open challenges, future research opportunities, and potential pathways for building trustworthy AI-driven 6G systems."

    "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent mental illness that poses significant challenges to global public health. Although various treatment options exist, their effectiveness is often limited by patient heterogeneity and the lack of individualized treatment strategies. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a safe and noninvasive intervention for depression. However, current clinical practices typically rely on subjective or empirical decision-making and often lack personalized rTMS protocol selection, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model for personalized rTMS treatment recommendation. The model leverages multisource patient profiles, including demographic information, clinical depression data, and rTMS treatment parameters. Unlike conventional approaches, our method uses contrastive learning (CL) to enhance patient representation learning, enabling the model to better capture similarities between patient profiles. Treatment recommendations are generated by identifying the Top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> most similar patients in the learned embedding space. Additionally, a similarity-based grouping strategy is introduced to divide the dataset into two subgroups, one receiving personalized rTMS protocols and the other receiving standard protocols. Experimental results show that BERT-based models achieve over 77.3% accuracy in Acc@Top-5. Furthermore, patients who received AI-suggested personalized rTMS protocols exhibited greater improvements in psychometric scale scores and larger effect sizes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to examine the role of CL and systematically analyze the impact of different neural encoders and Top-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> values.

Hybrid bonding technology stands out as one of the mainstream technologies for next-generation 3D packaging due to the small interconnect pitch and high bandwidth. The main process flow includes chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), surface activation, room-temperature pre-bonding, and annealing. However, due to the complex material system and long processing flow, the reaction mechanism at the bonding surface and interface remains unclear, which is closely related to the bonding process and interface quality. This paper systematically reviews the physicochemical reaction and the mechanism of metal/dielectric heterogeneous materials in the hybrid bonding process. Including (1) the influence of plasma and chemical treatment on the composition and structure of the metal/dielectric surface; (2) the evolution of the interfacial force, the influence of water molecules and bonding wave; (3) the bonding mechanism of metal/dielectric and the side reaction related to reliability. The comprehensive review of the surface and interface reaction helps to understand the bonding mechanism, which will guide the development of hybrid bonding technology."

    "abstract": "Industrial gas leaks create hazardous situations that can lead to fires and explosions, making their detection and monitoring crucial. The optical gas imaging (OGI) has proven to be an attractive way to ensure safe working conditions. However, existing implementations for OGI schemes rely on pixelated sensors for image capture that produce abundant redundant information. Low computational overhead and real-time gas leak detection remain challenging. In this article, we propose an image-free gas leak detection approach that enables the direct extraction of leakage features from 1-D signals. Aimed at image-free measurement, the proposed method optically samples the partial Fourier spectrum by combining a single-scanline sensor with a Fourier optics architecture. Moreover, to effectively mine sequence features, the wavelet-fused convolution-transformer network architecture is proposed to deeply fuse a convolutional neural network, which has the ability of local sensing, with a transformer, which has the advantage of global modeling, in the feature space by using the wavelet transform. Extensive validation experiments of the proposed method are carried out on a self-constructed image-free gas leakage dataset and a very domain-representative industrial scene, IOD-Video. The results show that the proposed image-free detection paradigm exhibits significant advantages, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.4% in an inference time of 3.28 ms."

    "abstract": "In acute ischemic stroke, precise and accurate delineation of infarcted brain tissue is critical for patient care. Automated segmentation of brain magnetic resonance imaging ischemic lesions can significantly aid clinical workflows, but remains a difficult task due to small lesion sizes, irregular morphologies, and high variability between patients in presentation. Manual annotation, while currently the gold standard, is tedious and prone to inconsistencies. This underscores the urgent need for reliable, automated approaches that can generalize across real-world imaging data. To address this, we apply nnU-Net framework, deep learning-based image segmentation architecture which is being applied to the ISLES 2022 dataset. We train 2D nnU-Net models using both bimodal (DWI + ADC) and trimodal (DWI + ADC + FLAIR) MRI inputs, with the latter incorporating a modality that is often misaligned spatially in this dataset. The SOTA achieves mean Dice (DSC) = 0.82 and lesion-wise F1 score = 0.86. The resulting bimodal & trimodal models achieves a mean Dice score = 0.7563 & 0.751 respectively and a lesion-F1 score = 0.8343 & 0.8305 respectively, demonstrating that nnU-Net performs reliable baseline performance out-of-the-box without ensemble methods or hyperparameter training. These results provide a clear benchmark for assessing future innovations in the segmentation of ischemic lesion, while highlighting the trade-offs introduced by misaligned imaging modalities like FLAIR."

The dataset includes 10,580 labelled X-ray images, categorized into two classes: Fractured and Not-Fractured. To solve the task of classification, we employed a transfer learning model derived from the EfficientNetB0 architecture. Preprocessing involved resizing images, normalization and stratified splitting into training, validation, and test sets. The model was trained and extensive evaluation was carried out using typical performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model attained a 99% accuracy, precision of 0.99, recall of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.98 for the Fractured class, and correspondingly high values for the Not-Fractured class. The findings, evidenced by confusion matrix analysis and performance curves, establish the reliability, clinical utility, and real-time diagnosis support applicability of the model in bone fracture detection systems."

    "abstract": "In the construction sector, excessive spending on materials and labour keeps causing delays and cost overruns, which in turn affect all parties involved in the contract in a negative way. The Project Manager is crucial in ensuring that the project runs smoothly and that the client is satisfied, two of the many aspects that affect the project's success. Managerial competence, accountability, and decision-making power are critical to the efficient and timely completion of building projects. Finding the most important project management competencies for keeping costs and timeframes under control was the goal of this study. After cleaning the data and evaluating dependability, the dimensionality reduction approach of PCA was used to identify and score the critical competencies that have a substantial impact on the project's outcomes. The most important competences in avoiding cost overruns and delays, according to the PCA-based results, are financial planning, risk management, efficient communication, and efficient decision-making. The significance of building and assessing project managers using data-driven insights is shown by these results. The research shows that in order to make the construction sector more efficient and sustainable; it is crucial to enhance these competences. This will lead to better project performance, less financial waste, and on-time project deliveries."

This paper presents Q-ChainX, a hybrid system, which combines the concepts of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with a Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) enabled blockchain, to build ultra secure, tamper resistant and resilient in the future data infrastructures. The suggested architecture consists of two communication layers, namely quantum and classical communication to transmit data and secure keys, respectively, and uses entanglement-based E91 QKD to generate symmetric keys. The cryptographic core supports NTRU and CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithms to substitute the standard RSA and ECC, which are resistant to quantum attacks. The consensus is obtained by the modified Proof-of-Authority mechanism supported by quantum randomness in the form of QRNGs, to allow a secure and fair election of validators. The key generation rates of a simulated Hyperledger environment simulated in Hyperledger-SimulaQron were found to be over 3800 bps, transaction finality time was found to be 408 ms on 15 nodes, and the consensus success rate was found to be 99.5. The hybrid quantum-PQC mode recorded 99.95 % data integrity and zero key compromise, ranked above the classical set up in all significant security parameters. These findings confirm the practicability of applying Q-ChainX in practice to the smart grids, defense communications, and medical data platforms. The further upgrading will be oriented on the optimization of quantum hardware, expansion of satellite-based QKD, and interoperability with multi-chain ecosystems. Q-ChainX is also a quantum leap to quantum resilient distributed systems, and it guarantees privacy, trust, and sustainability in the era of quantum computing."

For this purpose, we seek the optimal configuration of the RIS phase shifts that minimizes the smallest eigenvalue of the sensed interference-plus-noise autocovariance matrix at the receiver, thus unlocking new available signaling eigenmodes for communication. The proposed solver of the RIS phase shift optimization problem is a novel feedforward neural network (NN) calculator that outputs the desired RIS phase shift setting for any given interfering sources channel estimates. Simulation results presented in this paper show that installing and optimizing as described an RIS near the receiver can reduce the smallest eigenvalue of the disturbance autocovariance matrix close to the noise floor. Thus, after such RIS design, any individually optimized MIMO link to the receiving node of interest can offer dramatic increase in pre-detection signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in harsh spectral environments."

These techniques eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving the accuracy of downstream tracking models. Evaluated on NVIDIA’s AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves 1.78× higher tracking accuracy and an 8.6× reduction in inference latency in contrast to the standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various areas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to LLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or latencysensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency, especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM inference performance. By grouping requests into buckets with homogeneous sizes based on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and priority aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM in throughput, achieving up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.58 \\times$</tex> improvement.

In recent years, 5G and beyond technologies have garnered significant attention from the military communities to address certain capability requirements.Military technologies have traditionally developed independently from the civilian domain, due to the divergence of operational scenarios that mandate the need of stringent security and resilience overlay measures for seamless functionality in challenging environments. Commercially standardized technologies, like 5G, are generally not well-suited for such operational conditions. However, they can inherently offer wider interoperability and lower dependence on vendor-specific equipment. Additionally, improved quality of service (QoS) particularly with respect to throughput and wide spectral range are attractive features for consideration in military domain. Therefore, in order to use such commercial technologies for military operations, they should be made sufficiently robust to handle the operational requirements.In this paper, we focus on the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) and provide an novel incremental approach to ruggedize commercial network nodes at the RAN-level. This is followed by an analysis performed by Airbus inline with this approach. A preliminary version of this approach was initially presented at the 5G/6G improving the NATO Digital Backbone Track of TIDE Sprint-43, held during 17-21 February 2025 in Helsinki."

In this work, we present a novel beam learning framework that bypasses explicit self-interference channel estimation by designing beam codebooks to efficiently obtain implicit channel knowledge that can then be processed by a deep learning network to synthesize transmit and receive beams for full-duplex operation. Simulation results using ray-tracing illustrate that our proposed technique can allow a full-duplex base station to craft serving beams that couple low self-interference while delivering high SNR, with 75–97% fewer measurements than would be required for explicit estimation of the self-interference channel."

This study presents a systematic investigation into the impact of band structure engineering on the performance of heterojunction TFTs, by modulating the argon/oxygen ratio during sputtering and adjusting the thickness of individual layers. Results indicate that a large energy difference in the conduction band minimum or the Fermi level between the constituent layers leads to the formation of a deeper quantum potential well, thereby enhancing carrier transport efficiency and mobility. The optimized a-IZO/a-IGZO TFTs exhibit a high carrier mobility of $70 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{Vs}$, a low off-state current of approximately 1 pA, and a near-zero threshold voltage.

Usually, traditional classification methods find it hard to handle the complex shapes and colors seen in satellite images. The study introduces a system designed to recognize satellite images, applying AlexNet which is a powerful deep neural network famous for its ability to identify features and good computation. Since the EuroSAT RGB dataset consists of over 27,000 satellite images labeled in 10 categories, the system uses transfer learning to change the pretrained AlexNet weights for the goal of land cover classification. To optimize results, preprocessing tasks should include re-sizing images, adjusting their intensities and increasing the data set. The model achieves a 98% validation accuracy, making it more accurate than most comparative studies. On the accuracy and loss plots, the curves are coming together over time and the confusion matrix shows that all three categories, forest, agricultural and residential zones, are being separated clearly. In addition, the system’s ability to make consistent predictions is confirmed by precision, recall and F1-score. Based on AlexNet, the framework suggested for satellite image classification is strong, easy to use and gives important findings that support environmental research, observation of agriculture and analysis of spatial data. The findings demonstrate that deep learning makes automating geospatial functions with strong accuracy much easier."

Our algorithm optimizes the precoding at the base station (BS) within the set of precoders that null the interference to the satellite. Simulations demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the interference at the satellites and lowers the probability of violating prescribed LEO satellite protection thresholds, outperforming prior hybrid nulling algorithms. Results indicate that the algorithm maintains sum-rate within 3% of the existing hybrid solutions, while effectively improving interference to noise power by 22.4 dB."

Compared with the traditional structure of three independent Helmholtz coils stacked on top of each other, the DVM-OAC integrates the three-axis function in a single physical space, which reduces the volume by about 21.46%. The percentage of the space where the uniformity of the DVM-OAC is less than 3% reaches 3.98%, which is much larger than that of the three-axis Helmholtz coils, which is 0.82%. Experiments indicate that DVM-OAC can ensure high triaxial MF uniformity in the center region of sMSC, which is consistent with the theoretical results. This technology provides a new idea for high-precision magnetic environment regulation, which is especially suitable for wearable devices, implantable medical devices and other scenarios with stringent requirements for lightweighting and flexibility."

    "abstract": "As one of the most common sports injuries, lateral ankle sprains often lead to chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI), which may require ankle lateral stabilization surgery to enhance ankle stability. Postoperative rehabilitation is crucial for patients to regain pre-injury sports capabilities, yet traditional rehabilitation methods are time-consuming and costly, relying heavily on subjective and objective clinical assessments. Therefore, this study has developed a wearable intelligent telerehabilitation device designed to offer cost-effective postoperative rehabilitation progress evaluations for CLAI patients. The developed device integrates a portable sensor system including pressure insoles and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to capture gait and biomechanical data, and an evaluation algorithm employing few-shot learning model to enhance model performance with small datasets. The system was trained and tested using gait data collected from 102 patients, labelled by a professional clinician with over 20 years of surgical experiences through subjective selfreported fuctions, physical evaluation, and objective examination. In the test stage, the system demonstrated an accuracy of 0.89, recall of 0.88, specificity of 0.89, and an overall F1 score of 0.90, initially fulfills the clinical requirements. Compared to traditional machine learning models, the few-shot learning approach improved accuracy by at least 0.17 and the F1-score by 0.13. The device's cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and high repeatability make it a promising tool for at-scale both clinical and home-based rehabilitation. Besides, this study creatively introduced the few-shot learning method to the field of rehabilitation, offering a solution to address the challenge of limited high-quality data in rehabilitation studies, promoting the development of intelligent healthcare."

    "abstract": "Robust and accurate 6-DoF pose measurement in previously mapped environments is a cornerstone of autonomous systems, enabling tasks such as navigation, loop closure, and safety-critical decision-making. In large-scale urban or unstructured settings, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based pose measurement has become increasingly vital due to its geometric fidelity and resilience to illumination or appearance changes. This paper presents BioGraphLoc, a novel bio-inspired measurement framework that determines global poses by extracting and encoding structural nodes from a Moving Object Segmentation (MOS)-filtered static structure graph, leveraging biologically inspired mechanisms such as place cells and head-direction cells. Specifically, we first construct a Spatial Static Topology Graph (StatiGraph) from mid-scale static clusters, and encode each node with a lightweight 4D FroZone descriptor that captures depth-level grouping, local geometry, and topology. For reliable correspondence detection, we introduce a Neural Activation Consistency (NAC) strategy and incorporate Hebbian-inspired memory updates to track node stability across time. The final 6-DoF pose is then measured via robust Truncated Least Squares (TLS) optimization with angular regularization. Experiments on the KITTI, HeLiPR, and our custom dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art measurement accuracy, particularly excelling in structurally ambiguous and dynamically cluttered environments where traditional approaches often degrade, with the highest localization success rate reaching 91.32%."

To solve the problem, this article presents a method for target state probabilistic interval estimation, utilizing the set membership estimation approach based on probabilistic zonotopes. Initially, the proposed transformation operator effectively conducts reasonable transformation on the mixed interference of uncertain variables and stochastic errors. Subsequently, the set membership filtering is employed to predict and update the target state. Moreover, the probability assignment is proposed to convert the state estimation into probabilistic interval estimation. Finally, the robust state estimation algorithm framework based on probabilistic zonotopes is summarized. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method."

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a deep learning-based high-dynamic range (HDR) approach, DeepToF-HDR. The method combines two key neural networks: an exposure time selection network (ESN) that dynamically adjusts scene-dependent exposure times, and a depth fusion network (DFN) that integrates multi-exposure-ToF measurements. A composite loss function with end-to-end joint training is employed to ensure stable and synergistic optimization of both networks. Under identical exposure-time configurations, experiments on a real multi-exposure ToF dataset show that DeepToF-HDR achieves a 54.1% reduction in the mean absolute error (MAE) of the depth compared with conventional baselines. Comparable accuracy is also achieved with less than half the number of captures and only 28% of the total exposure time, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency."

Most existing deep learning and deep unfolding reconstruction methods: 1) do not sufficiently analyze the proximal subproblem and naturally derive network architectures from mathematical theory; 2) lack the ability to correct errors and recover details via multi-domain, multi-scale and multi-resolution analysis; 3) depend only on the previous stage and overlooking valuable information from earlier stages. In this study, we propose a Nesterov-optimized memory and geometric distillation learning framework (Nest-MGDL), which effectively integrates interpretability and adaptability to achieve robust and generalizable deep learning performance. By reformulating the proximal subproblem as the decomposition and distillation of memory and geometric priors across diverse domains, and integrating a local multi-level feature aggregation strategy, Nest-MGDL enables theoretically grounded network design and accurate multi-scale correction of errors. Inspired by the third-Nesterov acceleration scheme with fast convergence, we incorporate gradient information from measurement errors across multiple historical stages to achieve more consistent and accurate reconstruction. It provides new insights into leveraging historical measurement errors and designing explainable network architectures. All parameters in our Nest-MGDL are learnable end-to-end with adaptive initialization, enhancing model flexibility and ensuring stable convergence. Extensive experiments show that Nest-MGDL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."

Current UOT trackers include two-stream and one-stream trackers represented by Siamese network and OSTrack, respectively. However, these trackers have not achieved a balance between performance and efficiency. In addition, when observing large numbers of visually similar underwater objects (such as schools of fish), the current UOT trackers might result in tracking drift. To address these issues, we propose a novel underwater single-branch tracker, USBTrack, which only performs inference on the branch of search area. The template is preprocessed once through a novel template prompt module (TPM) consisting of a convolutional layer, a linear layer, and a residual connection, and the generated template prompt features are summed to the search area. The USBTrack integrates the advantages of template pre-processing in two-stream trackers and joint feature processing in one-stream trackers, thus achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Additionally, the summation-based interaction paradigm in USBTrack enables the model to focus more on the feature representation of the central part of the search region while suppressing tracking drift caused by the similar appearances of numerous objects of the same type. Comprehensive experiments show that USBTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while balancing efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/xxh1016/USBTrack."

This PUF ID is cryptographically linked to an NFT minted on a public blockchain, encapsulating metadata such as product origin, manufacturing details, and certification status. Associating NFTs and certifications with PUF-tagged products not only provides transparent provenance but also enables decentralised validation of compliance and ethical standards. This methodology is distinct in its integration of immutable physical identity with blockchain-based digital certification, offering a robust solution for enhancing transparency, combating counterfeiting, and fostering trust across global supply chains. Furthermore, employing Edge and emerging 6G networks, our framework can execute PUF challenge–response and preliminary NFT minting directly at edge nodes. This establishes a real-time, low-latency architecture that reduces network congestion and gas costs for secure and sustainable supply chains."

It includes a spatially adaptive key patch selection module to select small but informative patches, and a long-short feature map spatio-temporal relation module to capture dynamic changes in anomalous actions. Additionally, a spatio-temporal refined loss is introduced to enhance fine-grained feature learning. Experimental results on the HMDB51, Kinetics, and UCF-Crime v2 datasets show that our STKPS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomalous action recognition, outperforming the most competitive methods by 1.2% on the anomalous action dataset UCF-Crime v2."

This paper presents a lightweight fault tolerant multi-dimensional encrypted data aggregation scheme in fog computing-assisted smart grids, called FT-MEDA. To ensure transmitted electricity consumption data confidentiality, smart meters package multi-dimensional data by utilizing Chinese Remainder Theorem, and encrypt them under the modified symmetric homomorphic encryption. In addition, a key negotiation mechanism is devised to avoid the dependency on third-party trusted parties for important parameters allocation. Even if some smart meters within the negotiation group are compromised, the privacy of normal smart meters retains protected. In FT-MEDA, fog nodes (FN) deployed in smart grids, execute edge computing on integrity verification and generating aggregated encrypted data reports which will be sent to the control center (CC) for data anslysis. Security analysis indicates that FT-MEDA not only satisfies basic security requirements (e.g., confidentiality, integrity), but also resists collusion attacks and key leakage. Performance evaluation demonstrates that FT-MEDA has lightweight performance advantages in practical deployment of smart grids."

    "abstract": "Since the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced the Remote ID rule in 2021, ensuring drone privacy has become critical. Although the rule aims to increase accountability, it raises privacy concerns by exposing flight paths. Previous privacy-preserving protocols for drones rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) for drone authentication, which is unacceptable in critical infrastructure settings where flight data is sensitive and the ground control server (GCS) must authenticate drones in real-time. Furthermore, since existing studies rely on traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms, such as ECC or RSA, they should migrate to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure security against future quantum threats. However, applying PQC to existing protocols dramatically enlarges signatures and ciphertexts, causing them to exceed the 255-byte payload limit of Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Remote ID broadcasts. To address these challenges, we propose pqRID, the first method that supports both privacy and quantum-safe authentication under Remote ID constraints. pqRID uses pseudonym certificates for identification while preserving privacy and decouples identification from PQC-based authentication to satisfy broadcast size constraints. In pqRID, drones are provisioned with pseudonym certificates and IDs before flight. During flight, they broadcast their pseudonym IDs and use the corresponding certificate to authenticate themselves when prompted by the GCS without involving a TTP. We formally verified pqRID using ProVerif, ensuring authentication and unique ID non-disclosure. We implemented pqRID on a real UAV: a Raspberry Pi 4B mounted on a DJI-F450 drone. Our experimental results show that generating a PQC-based authentication message takes only 9ms and consumes 0.8J of energy on average."

The key features of the developed architecture are the injection of parallelism to serve multiple tasks and the control of these tasks via scalar parameters, ensuring dynamic switching between tasks. The structure of the proposed model is grounded in a computational analysis to avoid inference latency.

To support joint source-channel coding (JSCC) transmission for the proposed model, we develop a novel adaptability algorithm by adding binary masks. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed unified framework achieves nearly the same performance as a dedicated model per task, while offering significant computational complexity savings and improved memory and storage efficiency. Additionally, the immense superiority of our framework is showcased over the simple approach of devising a backbone with multiple heads."

    "abstract": "High-power, high-efficiency multibeam klystrons (MBKs) serve as essential RF power sources for large-scale accelerator facilities, where high-efficiency energy extraction from multiple beams without reflected electrons is critical for achieving stable and efficient operation. However, in practical MBK designs, the electric field distribution within the output cavity gap often becomes nonuniform due to the asymmetrical loading introduced by the coupling port. This field distortion leads to differentiated beamlet deceleration, resulting in reflected electrons in certain beamlets and degraded RF conversion efficiency. Based on the design of a 3-MW S-band high-efficiency MBK, this work proposes a method to improve electric field uniformity by shifting the ferrule region toward the coupling-port side and by introducing tuning rods on both the coupling-port side and the opposite side, arranged parallel to the beam tunnels. This hybrid design improves the field uniformity in the output gap from 53.8% to 92.1%, thereby enabling optimal beam–wave interactions. 3-D CST/PIC simulations demonstrate that the proposed method increases efficiency from 45.1% to 62.7% compared with a conventional reentrant output cavity. Furthermore, the fabricated new cylindrical reentrant output cavity structure was experimentally evaluated using the perturbation (Slater’s) method, confirming the improved field uniformity and validating the effectiveness of the proposed technique."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has completely changed our digital environment, making effective and smooth communication among interconnected devices. Overlays, which enable network virtualization, are a feasible way to handle the different requirements of IoT applications. However, challenges like Network Address Translation (NAT) and the complexity of handling overlays make communication problematic. While our previous work on cloud-based solutions provided valuable insights and enabled foundational services, it also revealed latency issues that motivated a shift toward more decentralized architectures. Leveraging Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) technology, we propose the deployment of peer-to-peer overlay networks at the edge of the IoT infrastructure. This decentralized method improves scalability and flexibility while decreasing latency. Our approach reduces the risk of network congestion and single choke points while enhancing the responsiveness of IoT applications by eschewing centralized cloud servers."

To address the problem, this work integrates a parallel structure combined with a delay-locked-loop (DLL) differential clock to reduce ripple and enhance driving capability. A dynamic compensation module adapts to load current changes, enabling real-time inverse compensation to maintain constant equivalent output current and ensure voltage stability. The charge pump is designed in 55-nm CMOS process. Simulation results show under load current fluctuations ranging from 50 to $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~A}$, the steady-state ripple remains approximately 2.1 mV, which is reduced by 86% compared to that of charge pump by dynamic clock frequency scaling.

Our approach leverages both passive and active channels to extract information from HDMI signals without protocol-level access or physical tampering. Through the unintentional EM leakage channel, we accurately infer playback states (play vs. paused) and audio types (speech vs. music) with 100% classification accuracy. We further achieve 96.67% accuracy in fine-grained spoken digits recognition using feature fusion and bootstrapped learning. Complementing this, we demonstrate an actively modulated covert channel that encodes data into the EM emissions of HDMI audio streams. This covert channel supports reliable transmission across air-gapped, wall-separated environments with an effective throughput of 12bits per second. Our findings reveal that HDMI audio paths, traditionally considered benign, can in fact serve as powerful side-channel vectors for behavioral inference and stealthy data exfiltration, posing serious risks to both consumer and industrial systems."

Among them, the Integrated Fan-Out (InFO) Wafer-Level Chip-Scale Package (WLCSP) has gained significant attention as a cuttingedge solution that enables high-density and flexible system integration through multi-chip integration and multi-layer interconnection. As the physical size of InFO-WLCSP packages expands, the I/O pad density increases exponentially, making the topological crossover of free-assignment nets a critical bottleneck that severely constrains routing quality. Existing methods typically address topological crossover issues during the routing stage through iterative approaches, which often fail to provide satisfactory solutions. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a predictive approach to anticipate topological crossovers of freeassignment nets prior to routing. This approach incorporates layer assignment considerations while aiming to minimize total wire length. We introduce a Voronoi Diagram-based iteration algorithm to effectively resolve the topology-compatible allocation problem in the fan-in region. Additionally, we propose a novel Voronoi region merging strategy to adaptively partition the fanout region across multiple chips. A novel model is developed to address the topology-compatible allocation problem, and a final layer assignment is derived using the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and efficiency of our algorithm."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a high-bandwidth, low-noise rail-to-rail amplifier. The input stage achieves high gain while significantly enhancing bandwidth by cascading a high-gain operational amplifier path with a high-bandwidth operational amplifier path. The input transistor pair operates in the subthreshold region, enabling low equivalent input noise voltage and reduced power consumption. The intermediate stage employs a folded-cascode active load directly combined with a class-AB operational amplifier-controlled output stage, which not only reduces static power consumption but also expands the output signal swing range and significantly enhances load-driving capability. Additionally, a slew rate enhancement circuit is further designed to ensure the output stage delivers large output currents under low quiescent current conditions for rail-to-rail output swing. Finally, the output structure utilizes capacitive compensation through internal feedback loops to establish fast feedback channels, ensuring system stability while suppressing output ripple. Implemented by using HJ $0.18 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ BCD process technology, the layout occupies an area of $890 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 495 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. Postlayout simulation results demonstrate that the amplifier achieves rail-to-rail input/output functionality with an open-loop gain of 150.9 dB, phase margin of 86.42°, and gain-bandwidth product of 20.43 MHz. The equivalent input noise at 1 kHz is $5.53 \\mathrm{nV} / \\sqrt{ } \\mathrm{Hz}$, with a common-mode rejection ratio of 112.6 dB.

The proposed emulator is constructed from a compact assembly of nine MOS transistors, three resistors, and a single capacitor. Interestingly, unlike previous research, the novel dual-function memristor emulator has an easy-to-use design and maintains the memristor’s hysteresis characteristic curves for input sine waves up to 500 MHz in frequency. The distinctive features of the pinched hysteresis curve and the nonvolatility of the memristor emulator across various frequency domains have been experimentally validated using 130 nm CMOS technology. The empirical validation of the circuit, realized on a breadboard utilizing commercial components, conclusively corroborates the findings of both theoretical analysis and simulation. Subsequently, a crossbar model of the memristor has been established using data derived from the proposed emulator. Utilizing three distinct datasets—comprising small digits, file types, and large digits—we have trained the model employing the backpropagation algorithm, subsequently assessing its training performance on diverse datasets. The outcomes indicate that the model achieves an accuracy rate as high as approximately 94%—even for the large digits set—after only 10 training epochs."

This paper is a deep learning-based classification model of a fine-tuned VGG16 convolutional neural network to classify mushrooms into 4 different categories: Edible, Conditionally Edible, Deadly, and Poisonous. They used a very large dataset of about 104,000 images that are highly diverse in species, and one could be confident that the feature representation is robust when it comes to the cap structures, gill patterns, colour variations. Images were re-scaled and normalized and subjected to severe augmentation methods to improve generalization. VGG16 was pretrained with ImageNet weights and then used with a staged fine-tuning approach whereby the lower convolutional blocks were frozen, and then a task specific classifier head was trained and then the last convolutional layers were unfrozen selectively to adapt. The Adam optimizer was used to optimize with the use of the differential learning rates and weight decay, early stopping, and checkpointing. The model had a general accuracy of 95% in classification and an equal level of accuracy in terms of precision, recall, and F1-values. Grad-CAM visualizations also showed that the model gives attention to diagnostically useful mushroom patterns, which makes it more interpretable and reliable in practice."

    "abstract": "Data-driven decision support systems are definitely the most important systems in modern agriculture. Even though AI models can produce really accurate suggestions regarding crop planning and yield forecasting, their acceptance by farmers and agricultural specialists is always restricted due to the lack of transparency. A research paper presents AgroXAI, an up-to-date XAI-based smart agriculture platform, which meshes predictability with rainfall forecasting, crop recommendation, and yield prediction. To help the farmers comprehend and trust the forecasts, this system presents brief and local explanations with the use of SHAP and LIME. The suggested system is lightweight and, thus, either cloud-based or cloud-free and, therefore, can be easily used by a wide range of people. Also, it is a democratic system as it is easy to get access."

    "abstract": "Blocked-impurity-band (BIB) far-infrared focal plane array (FPA) detectors are widely used in infrared detection, the performance of which are directly affected by the dynamic range of the readout integrated circuits (ROICs). In this paper, two novel techniques are proposed to improve the dynamic range of ROICs. The proposed background signal suppression technique and integral capacitor sharing technique improve the dynamic range by reducing noise signals and increasing saturated charge capacity, respectively. At the same time, since BIB detectors need to work in cryogenic environment ($\\mathrm{T}{\\lt}10 \\mathrm{~K}$), which means ROICs need to operate at the same temperature. In order to eliminate cryogenic non-ideal effect of transistors, this paper proposes a cryogenic transistor model to ensure the performance of ROICs. The proposed ROIC is designed and fabricated with $0.18 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ CMOS technology, the size of which is $700 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\times 650 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The power consumption is 3.02 mW, the readout rate is 1 MHz and the saturation charge capacity reaches 40 Me-/pixel. Overall, the dynamic range of the proposed ROIC is 70dB, which meets the aim of the design."

Time inefficiency, human error, and spoofing are some of the problems with traditional attendance techniques, such as manual and biometric systems. Only students who are physically connected to the classroom’s assigned network (by SSID/BSSID/MAC verification) are able to mark attendance thanks to the suggested framework’s use of router-based device authentication. Simultaneously, identity validation is strengthened by an OTP created by the instructor and validated via a mobile or web interface. Session logs, device information, and attendance analytics are all stored in a centralized database that is updated in real time. A fallback QR mechanism guarantees continuity in the event of Wi-Fi outages. The system offers an administrator dashboard for monitoring attendance statistics, student performance, and connectivity history. The DA-Router Framework advances the automation and integrity of attendance management by enabling a dependable, scalable, and impenetrable solution for contemporary educational institutions by fusing network-layer verification with OTP-based security."

However, current datasets primarily target general scenes, lacking the vital, specific structures and elements found in railway tracks.

An intelligent fault diagnosis method is proposed, integrates an improved Symmetrized Dot Pattern (SDP) image with an AlexNet-based model augmented by a multi-head wavelet attention block. Vibration signals are first decomposed using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). The resulting modal data from multiple sensors are transformed into VMD SDP (VSDP) images and then integrated into a composite Multi-channel VSDP (MVSDP) image, which significantly enriches fault feature representation. This image is processed by a customized AlexNet model incorporating a multi-head wavelet attention mechanism, which collectively solves the challenges of feature clustering, multi-angle attention, and feature fusion to extract global fault information comprehensively. Validation on the CWRU bearing dataset confirms that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both recognition accuracy and operational stability."

    "abstract": "Flexible medical devices require accurate real-time shape feedback during minimally invasive procedures. Conventional fluoroscopic imaging, while used, is limited to 2D views and exposes users to ionising radiation. Fibre-Bragg grating sensing provides a radiation-free alternative but demands complex and costly systems. A purely electromagnetic approach is introduced that uses three uniaxial inductive sensors connected in series, which reduces wiring complexity by requiring only two conductors, regardless of sensor count. This series-connected sensor configuration substantially reduces wiring complexity and acquisition hardware demands, however, it necessitates greater field generation requirements and incurs longer solver runtimes. A lumped parameter model for series-connected sensors is introduced and validated experimentally through impedance measurements, demonstrating minimal amplitude and phase distortion below 10 kHz. The open-source Anser electromagnetic tracking (EMT) platform is extended by using three planar field generators (totaling 24 coils) and implementing a novel objective function that simultaneously estimates the position and orientation of three series sensors. Static accuracy evaluations conducted over a volume of 200 mm × 200 mm × 100 mm yielded mean errors below 2.2 mm, while mean errors in dynamic assessments were below 1.2 mm. These results constitute an initial step toward compact and accurate shape sensing for flexible catheters in endovascular interventions."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted significant attention due to their abilities to dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation. In this work, an efficient surrogate modeling framework based on an improved Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) is proposed to predict the far-field radiation patterns of RIS, significantly reducing the reliance on computationally expensive full wave simulations by the online inferences. Specifically, the proposed architecture integrates a convolutional branch network to extract spatial features from RIS configurations and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based trunk network to encode angular information. Outputs of both networks are fused and passed through a decoder to generate accurate radiation pattern predictions. We verify the proposed framework on the RIS that employs a 20×20 array of 1 bit controllable units, with binary states representing the ON/OFF conditions. It is shown that, compared to several state-of-the-art learning frameworks, the proposed model suggests superior prediction accuracy and training efficiency under limited data scenarios, offering a promising solution for fast and reliable RIS radiation pattern evaluation."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the use of a millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging radar system operating at 228 GHz for indoor mapping and the detection of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) objects behind a corner. Mapping experiments were conducted in an Lshaped corridor to evaluate the radar's capability to detect and localize both line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS targets, as well as interior structural features. The radar system employs a scanning reflector that generates a fan beam with a narrow azimuth beamwidth (0.4°) and a wide elevation beam (4°). The results demonstrate that the radar achieves high precision in detecting and mapping LOS corridor walls and obstacles. Notably, NLOS objects were also detected due to multipath reflections between the corridor walls. However, the detected positions of these objects appeared as ghost targets located behind the reflecting walls. To address this, a mirroring transformation was applied to recover the true locations of the NLOS targets. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to generalize this transformation for indoor environments with arbitrary layouts. The final reconstructed corridor map shows that NLOS targets were accurately repositioned to their true locations, and previously occluded corridor areas were successfully reconstructed, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in complex indoor environments."

However, existing intelligent ABR methods have limitations, i.e., the lack of logical reasoning capability for video-aware symbolic representations leads to low sampling efficiency and fails to achieve the optimal performance of Bitrate Adaptation. We introduce NeuroBA, a learning-based approach to realize ABR using neuro-symbolic deep reinforcement learning. NeuroBA trains a neuro-symbolic deep network model without making any assumptions about the edge video scene and without relying on a predefined model. Instead, it enables bitrate decision-making under uncertainty and partial observability by knowledge-driven video quality perception in symbolic first-order logic. To enhance wireless signals, we have introduced Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) technology to address this issue. By dynamically adjusting the phase shift of IRS, the throughput performance of wireless networks is significantly improved. Based on trace-driven and real-world experiments covering a variety of edge video scenarios, and network performance metrics, NeuroBA is compared with state-of-the-art ABR schemes, and NeuroBA exhibits superior performance, with an average QoE improvement of 16.58% (BOLA)-25.34% (Fugu). In particular, it outperforms existing baseline approaches even without pre-programmed models and network scenarios assumed for the edge network."

    "abstract": "The conductivity probe serves as an effective instrument for measuring two-phase flow parameters; however, its application in high-temperature and high-pressure environments faces constraints due to structure and signal processing algorithm. Under such conditions, the probe signal is vulnerable to noise, baseline drift and waveform distortion. Conventional algorithms, predominantly designed for standard temperature and pressure conditions, demonstrate limited efficacy in addressing these complex challenges. Therefore, a comprehensive signal processing framework was proposed. First, variational mode decomposition (VMD) was integrated with wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) to effectively suppress noise. Subsequently, the sensitive nonlinear iterative peak (SNIP) algorithm was employed for accurate baseline estimation. Finally, the slope and extreme value analysis (SEVA) algorithm was utilized for precise identification of bubble signals. Experimental validation was conducted under pressures ranging from 0.8 MPa to 4.1 MPa. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively processes conductivity probe signals under such conditions. The conductivity probe achieved an expanded uncertainty of 3.88% (coverage factor k = 2), corresponding to a 95% confidence level. Experimental void fraction results were compared with predictions from the classical drift-flux models, demonstrating relative deviations within 30%. Additionally, a comparison with image processing measurements revealed a smaller margin of relative deviation, limited to 12%."

    "abstract": "Cyber-security plays a critical role in e-commerce operations; however, the influence of e-tailer's risk preference on the strategic response to cyber-security challenges remains underexplored. This study aims to contribute to this underexplored area by examining a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a risk-sensitive e-tailer, whose risk preference may be risk-seeking, risk-neutral, or risk-averse. We examine the equilibrium outcomes under two scenarios: one with and one without the government penalty on the e-tailer for failing to defend against cyber-attacks. Interestingly, risk aversion of the e-tailer tends to hurt consumers, whereas a risk-seeking attitude could benefit consumers. More importantly, increased risk sensitivity of the e-tailer can lead to higher consumer surplus. However, compared to a risk-seeking e-tailer, a risk-averse e-tailer tends to generate greater social welfare. When the government penalty is implemented, it proves beneficial to consumers irrespective of the e-tailer's risk attitude. Counter intuitively, we also find that with or without the government penalty, the risk-seeking e-tailer invests more in cyber-security than the risk-averse e-tailer. To test the robustness of our main models, we extend the analysis to consider blockchain adoption and alliances among supply chain members. Our research provides valuable insights for policymakers and platforms in enhancing e-commerce platform security management by taking into account the e-tailer's risk attitude."

The experimental dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and contains 1,194 images, out of which 1,050 images are used for training and 144 images are used for testing. Every image was preprocessed by resizing, normalizing, and applying augmentation techniques in order to maintain consistency and enhance generalization. The suggested architecture is started with various convolutional and pooling layers for the extraction of features, followed by the addition of Batch Normalization to stabilize the training process and Dropout layers in order to avoid overfitting. To avoid the complexity of the model and enhance robustness, a Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer is utilized rather than a conventional flattening operation. Moreover, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism is used to enable the network to focus on salient areas of the image and suppresses irrelevant details. Lastly, the classification is conducted using dense fully connected layers followed by a softmax output layer. Experimental results prove that the proposed model attains about 99% accuracy on the test set, with high precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes. These results show that the suggested CNN model is excellent, efficient, and trustworthy for medical image classification, and is able to offer promising assistance in clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Fire accidents occur due to natural causes like forest fires, human mistakes, and poor fire safety in places such as malls, industries, and public transport. Because of these fire accidents, many people and animals are losing their lives, properties are being destroyed, and the environment is getting damaged due to air pollution. Because of recent technological advancements, the number of deaths from fire accidents is decreasing every year. However, these systems still face real-time challenges because they depend heavily on human involvement. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, this work proposes a robot that can operate in difficult environments, detect fire, and control it by spraying water or foam. The proposed system consists of flame sensors (capable of identifying fire up to 100 cm and an angle of 600) to identify the fire and servo motor to rote the water pump when the fire is detected. The robot can move forward, backward, right and left sides in order to sprinkle the water in all directions of the fire. Simultaneously, alerts are transmitted to the user through the Blynk IoT platform, ensuring real-time monitoring via mobile notifications and email.

    "abstract": "In deep learning approach of classifying brain tumors by utilizing the VGG 19 convolutional neural network (CNNs) with transfer learning is proposed. To solve the class imbalance problem between tumor and healthy samples, the proposed methodology begins with preprocessing brain MRI images through data augmentation, i.e. rotation, shifting, shearing and flipping. In order to give better results to extract region of interest, post processing techniques like converting grayscale, gaussian, threshold, erosion, dilation and contour are applied. The main feature extractor is the VGG19 model, and it has already been trained on the ImageNet dataset. The frozen convolutional layers are used to train a classifier which is then selectively unfrozen and further trained to be tailored to the target dataset. Standard metrics such as accuracy and loss across training and validation and test sets are used to assess the recital of the system suggested. Results from experiments indicate that the use of transfer learning with VGG19 has made it possible to detect brain tumors efficiently and automatically, making it effective for improving clinical decision support and the diagnoses of medical images."

Unfortunately, antenna arrays add hardware constraints that may limit the effectiveness of interference mitigation for mobile devices.

We develop a genetic algorithm for configuring the DMA weights to adaptively steer both beams and nulls. We find that a DMA in electromagnetic simulations can consistently generate a peak-to-null ratio between 20 and 52 dB while maintaining good nullsteering accuracy."

Even though it is widely used in clinical practice, manually interpreting corneal images is not trustworthy or objective. To address these constraints, deep learning methodologies were employed to automate image classification and reconstruction. This research evaluates the efficacy of a Hybrid EfficientNetB13 model, EfficientNetB1, and EfficientNetB3 on fluorescein-stained corneal images. After training and testing each model, a variety of quantitative metrics were employed, including as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Entropy, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. The experimental findings showed that EfficientNetB1 had the best PSNR (10.48) and the worst MSE (5817.75), which means that the quality of the picture reconstruction was better than that of the other models. Even though the SSIM values were low, which showed how hard it is to keep minor structural information, all three models had the same classification performance, with an accuracy of 0.75 and an F1 score of 0.80. The results indicate that architectures based on EfficientNet may reliably automate the analysis of ophthalmic images, enabling physicians to diagnose corneal problems more swiftly and objectively."

Traditional verification approaches, relying heavily on static stimuli and manual inspection, suffer from insufficient coverage, low automation, and poor reusability, thus failing to guarantee the functional integrity of such complex designs. To address these challenges, this work proposes and implements a reusable verification framework based on the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), specifically tailored for advanced pixel readout chips. The key contributions of this framework include: (1) a physics-aware stimulus generator for emulating realistic particle-hit events; (2) a generic serial bus configuration component leveraging the Register ion Layer (RAL) to enable high-level automated configuration; and (3) an intelligent scoreboard capable of out-oforder data matching to ensure robust data validation. The framework’s effectiveness was validated on a pixel readout chip, where its metric-driven verification (MDV) methodology successfully exercised complex functionalities and corner cases of the design. By adopting a modular architecture, the framework significantly enhances reusability and efficiency, offering a systematic and scalable solution for the verification of similar mixed-signal chips."

In order to overcome this new weakness quantum cryptography proposes a radically new security paradigm based on the laws of quantum mechanics. The given paper provides the design and implementation of a platform of an interactive simulation modeling two basic Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols: BB84 and E91. The platform has been created as a series of modules in Streamlit to allow users to simulate the transmission of a key using qubits, visualize key-processing interactions after transmission, trace Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER), and identify possible eavesdropping by assessing CHSH inequality after transmission. The system is also enhanced with other features like real time graphics dash boards, user authentication and a comparative module to analyse the classical and quantum cryptographic methodologies. An experimental simulation of the influence of channel noise and adversarial interference on QBER and the efficiency of key generation proves the resilience of quantum protocols in the face of eavesdropping attack. The platform is an educational and research resource, allowing users to learn about the concept of quantum physics, including superposition and entanglement, as well as visualize the process of secure key exchange, because of its intuitive interface and elaborate visualizations.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, blockchain technology has turned into a disruptive innovation that can tackle the inefficiencies posed by long-standing record-keeping systems across industries. One of the highly impactful applications relates to land registration and property management, which have been traditionally prone to issues like fraud, tampering, bureaucratic delays, and lack of transparency. So much so that traditional land registries are mostly based on centralized databases with an additional layer of paper-based records, making them all too easy to manipulate or corrupt. This research proposes a blockchain-based land- registration framework to ensure transparency, security, and tamper-proof ownership records. The system contains modules for buyers, sellers, and government agencies while implementing hashing algorithms, consensus protocols, and smart contracts to automate transactions and preserve data integrity. By eradicating intermediaries, the framework reduces costs and delays and enhances trust among the stakeholders. Unlike traditional systems, every transaction on the blockchain cannot be altered or tampered with and leaves an auditable trail of all ownership history. This model also includes administrative oversight to validate and monitor compliance, allowing technical robustness and legal acceptance. Furthermore, the system depicts worldwide accessibility and interoperability for securing verification of property details across jurisdictions. The framework offers e-governance in a scalable, efficient, and citizen-friendly manner, addressing fraud and double-selling. Overall, the system demonstrates that blockchain can transform land registration into a secure, transparent, and efficient establishment for managing lands."

In high-density interconnect (HDI) PCBs, traditional layout indexing algorithms suffer from low query efficiency due to massive data volumes, primarily caused by the large number of components and their compact spatial distribution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an optimized approach to the classic R-tree algorithm. It adjusts the data storage capacity of nodes based on the scale of layout data adaptively and further optimizes the node splitting strategy using a heuristic splitting factor. This method reduces the overlap rate of spatial division, constructing an efficient indexing structure tailored for HDI PCBs. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional R -tree indexing algorithm, the proposed method achieves superior spatial index planning while ensuring query accuracy, with significantly improved indexing efficiency."

Our approach integrates a semi-supervised prototypical loss that leverages pseudo-labels from high-confidence samples, improving representation learning and model performance.We evaluate our method on benchmark network intrusion detection datasets, where we demonstrate its ability to generalize to novel attack classes with few labeled samples. Experimental results show that the proposed semi-supervised Prototypical Networks (SSPNet) outperforms standard Prototypical Networks and other competing models, particularly in scenarios where newly introduced target attack categories are highly dissimilar to source attacks: it performs 24% better on ACI-IoT-2023 Network Traffic Dataset and 15% better on CICIDS2017 than the standard Prototypical Networks. Our findings highlight the potential of semi-supervised few-shot learning in increasing the adaptability and reliability of NIDS in countering emerging cyber threats."

Specifically, we introduce multi-scale perplexity signatures, i.e., structured representations of model perplexity computed across multiple sliding window sizes, to capture local and global fluctuations in predictive confidence. These signatures serve as input to lightweight statistical classifiers, such as OC-SVMs, which are trained exclusively on clean prompts to detect anomalous inputs. Extensive experiments are conducted on an open dataset, and the results demonstrate that the multiscale perplexity signatures captured by the proposed approach are effective in distinguishing injected prompts from clean ones across multiple detection models."

    "abstract": "The IETF More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) protocol enables interoperable group messaging across otherwise isolated services such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram. It routes every Messaging Layer Security (MLS) ciphertext through a central hub that timestamps the message and broadcasts it to all group participants. If the hub is compromised, it can silently drop, delay, or reorder messages, undermining order integrity while leaving end-to-end encryption intact.We introduce a lightweight, Merkle-tree-based audit layer that allows clients to detect such misbehavior. Each client stores every received message together with its hub-assigned timestamp in an ordered list. Clients periodically generate a Merkle proof from this list and broadcast it by embedding the proof in an encrypted application message. Because the hub cannot predict which messages carry proofs, it cannot selectively discard them. Upon receiving a proof, other clients verify it and broadcast their own proofs. Any inconsistency is then propagated to the entire room, creating a non-repudiable record of hub misconduct.A Rust prototype built on OpenMLS was evaluated on a 100-node emulated network. With a client sampling rate of 5%, and a hub attack probability of 10%, the scheme detected 95% of message-drop or reordering attacks within the first 40 messages, consumed only 3kB of additional memory per client, and required less than 1ms of client-side processing per proof. The audit’s memory requirement grows linearly with room size and requires no changes to the hub protocol, providing a practical, low-overhead path to verifiable message-order integrity in large interoperable messaging systems."

    "abstract": "Modern scientific workflows are data-intensive, geographically distributed, and time-sensitive, demanding reliable, low-latency data transfers across high-performance networks. While current solutions, such as ESnet’s OSCARS, offer static bandwidth reservation, they lack the fine-grained, deterministic guarantees essential for emerging real-time applications. To address this gap, we explore the applicability of Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (CQF), a deterministic scheduling mechanism traditionally designed for Local Area Networks (LANs), to the unique challenges of Wide Area Networks (WANs). We propose a novel architecture that integrates CQF with multi-path routing to enhance reliability and evaluate it through a comparative simulation against OSCARS on a realistic ESnet topology, considering both time-triggered and event-triggered flows. Our results demonstrate that with proper parameter tuning, CQF can achieve a performance comparable to that of OSCARS in terms of latency, acceptance rate, and network utilization. As one of the first efforts to adapt CQF for WAN-scale scientific workflows, this study highlights its potential to enable deterministic communication for high-volume, long-distance scientific networks."

    "abstract": "Concrete is a key component in modern infrastructure used in dams, bridges, buildings, and roads since of its compressive strength and durability. Still, cracks in concrete constructions greatly affect safety and increase maintenance costs. Conventional visual inspections by engineers are labour-intensive, time-consuming, prone to human error, and demand exact, automated, effective method of cracking detection. This work uses TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build an artificial intelligence-driven concrete structural cracking detection system. CNNs remove the need for handcrafted feature extraction required in traditional methods since they automatically extract spatial features from images. The work uses a 40,000 concrete surface photo collection under diverse environments in order to guarantee model durability. Among preprocessing techniques applied before training are normalising and resizing. Having been trained with the Adam optimiser and cross-entropy loss function, the CNN model consists of several fully linked layers, pooling layers, and convolutional layers. Evaluation of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score helps to confirm the model's capacity to distinguish between cracked and non-cracked surfaces. Accurate experimental findings show that the CNN-based model is reliable in case of automated fracture detection. Manual inspection is reduced, safety is supported, and maintenance expenses are decreased, which makes this AI-based solution enhance infrastructure monitoring. The further studies should dig into more advanced deep learning systems, expanding datasets, and real-time usage. Integrating artificial intelligence solutions will assist the building and civil engineering sectors to move towards proactive and innovative infrastructure maintenance solutions."

In this paper, we propose a novel Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN) based UAV Base Station Positioning (UBSP) approach to determine the three dimensional positions for multiple UAV base stations. The problem is framed as a reinforcement learning task, where the UAVs’ positions and flight trajectories are optimized through the exploitation of a dynamically changing hybrid reward function, which augments the impacts of UAV actions on sum-rate and coverage performance of ground units. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms deep reinforcement learning based methods in terms of both sum-rate and user coverage. The results highlight the potential of DDQN-based UAV deployment strategies in next-generation wireless communication networks, offering a robust solution for dynamic and resource-constrained tactical communication environments."

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is widely used in both civilian and defense applications, especially in autonomous vehicles (AVs), due to its resilience in adverse weather and its capability to accurately estimate object range and velocity. However, the growing reliance on radar introduces security vulnerabilities, particularly spoofing attacks that can manipulate the perceived scene. This work investigates two passive spoofing scenarios: (1) using radar-absorbing material to conceal a target, and (2) using reflective material to create phantom/ghost objects, thereby altering the radar’s interpretation of its surroundings. Such manipulations can mislead AVs in perceiving their environment, potentially resulting in unsafe driving decisions or accidents. These attacks are both effective and easy to launch, becoming a potential threat to civilian and military applications. Range–Doppler data are collected from outdoor experiments under normal and spoofed conditions, including target-only, RF absorber, and reflector configurations. The collected data are used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the InceptionV3 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned using transfer learning to extract radar-specific features. The proposed model achieved a validation accuracy of 94.4% and an evaluation accuracy of 93%, demonstrating consistent performance across all classes. These results highlight the potential of vision-based deep learning to improve the robustness of mmWave radar sensing against passive spoofing attacks in AV applications."

It is search of this study to formulate a block-chain-based IoT network that provides secure, trustful and corrupted-proof transmission of data. What is new in the approach is the combination of the use of machine learning-based real-time anomaly detection and the Ethereum-based smart contracts in the creation of a decentralized and intelligent security layer. In the offered framework, models XGBoost are trained using the Edge-IIoTset dataset with maximum accuracy of detection of 98%. Compared to traditional centralized and standalone ML-based solutions, the hybrid system is found to be much more efficient in both initial detection (precision), trust enforcement, and resilience. The findings ratify that the framework can be deployed in sensitive IoT/IIoT networks based not only on its ability to identify the source of cyber threats and curb them in real-time without necessitating any update, but also on its potential to increase the transparency and traceability of the network."

Today, modern electronic payment instruments and financial facilities are becoming more and more susceptible to new methods of fraud which are unobtrusively reproducing the activities of legitimate interests to the detriment of the economy which is losing incalculable sums of money. In order to overcome this the combination technique of quantum and classical methods of calculating the data is a great way to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the fraud detection. It is applied by means of Quantum Support Vector Machine, Variational Quantum Classifier, the classical algorithms of Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor with an ensemble based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization. These algorithms are used together to scan a stream of transactions in real time and classify what is legitimate behaviour and what is unfavourable behaviour. The work provides evidence to prove that hybrid quantum-classical techniques can improve on the performance of classical systems using improved recall, less false negatives and the speed of detection of new types of frauds. It is shown that the integration of quantum intelligence based upon classical methods of analysis is a powerful and fruitful means to enhance levels of secure financial practice and help combat large scale financial frauds in modern digital environments."

In particular, we consider a large-scale environment where sensing assets are deployed. Our objective is to determine, using low-cost, noisy measurements, which group of sensors is closest to a target. That is, our goal is to simply keep the target \"on the radar\": unlike traditional tracking algorithms that attempt to find the exact vehicle location, our aim is not to do so, but instead, identify a set of sensors, that would be most likely if prompted for higher quality (and cost) measurements to achieve an exact localization. To accomplish this task, we leverage a Bayesian inference algorithm that explicitly learns and integrates probabilistic observation models, both parametric and nonparametric, using offline training data. We evaluate our approach using experimental data collected from tracking ATV-type vehicles using acoustic sensors of Raspberry Pi nodes, and illustrate trade-offs between accuracy, number of measurements and size of the recommended sensor set."

However, this approach results in a circuit complexity that is more than twice that of the original design. To mitigate this issue, we propose the adoption of a Timing-Interleaving DFE (TID) summer and a direct multiplexing sampler. This method effectively reduces the circuit complexity to less than half of that required by the conventional loop-unrolled DFE design. Compared to the traditional current string scheme, the proposed design achieves a 90% reduction in DFE coefficient variation and improves the DFE feedback time by 0.12 UI at 7200Mbps"

These systems typically feature dedicated databases storing images of missing persons, employing continuous facial analysis in video streams to facilitate immediate matches.

By synthesizing insights from an extended set of studies spanning 2020–2025, we illuminate key advancements in achieving high-accuracy real-time identification and alert dissemination, while critically assessing gaps in areas such as model explainability, data robustness against environmental variations, ethical considerations including privacy and bias, and scalability for large-scale implementations.

Conventional screening which still involves manual Pap Smear tests, takes a lot of effort, is hard to interpret and may cause errors because of variations in how each observer studies the sample. Researchers here use InceptionV3, a famous deep learning model, to build an automated system for classifying cervical cells. To use image data from Herlev Pap Smear, the model is fine-tuned by using pretrained weights learned on ImageNet and the images in the dataset are divided into the seven diagnostic categories: normal squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar epithelial, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. For better generalization and overfitting mitigation, techniques such as image size adjustment, scaling and a lot of extra data are employed. According to experiments, the system reaches an accuracy of 97% and precision, recall and F1-scores remain even throughout all the categories. Checking training and validation curves shows that the model trains accurately and the confusion matrix demonstrates that it can clearly tell apart different classes, even for cells that look alike. According to the suggested system, it will be easier to use automated methods for cervical cancer screening and early treatment, because the system offers a scalable, precise and effective way to diagnose."

The low-frequency drift is contaminated with the raw ECG signal due to the patient’s movements and improper electrode selection. The REMD technique is used to eliminate low-frequency drift. Deep CNN is used to identify the spatial features, and BiLSTM captures the temporal information present in the preprocessed ECG signal. The CBAM layer focuses on the most important features through channel and spatial attention. The developed framework is assessed using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The developed framework achieves an accuracy of 99.28% and an F1 score of 99.27% compared to existing techniques.

By decomposing a quantum channel into a unitary operation and a dissipative mechanism, parameter estimation of a general quantum channel can be effectively completed in two-step sequential realization, which has been successfully verified by simulations."

    "abstract": "Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithms are critical to the warfighter as they ensure detection radars maintain consistent false alarm rates amidst dynamic backgrounds with noise, clutter, and interference. However, there is growing evidence that emergent advanced wireless communications technologies, such as 4G and 5G, generate interference that violates the Gaussian assumption on which many CFAR algorithms rely. This paper presents a study of the effects of such non-Gaussian interference on CFAR algorithms, with a focus on the widely used Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR). Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that non-Gaussian interference can cause significant variability in false alarm rates, potentially undermining the ability of the modern warfighter to maintain operational superiority. To address these challenges, we evaluate Order Statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) as a mitigation technique, finding that it can maintain CFAR in non-Gaussian environments at the expense of detection performance. We also discuss several considerations for optimizing the stability and detection performance of OS-CFAR detectors operating in complex and dynamic environments. By advancing our understanding of CFAR algorithms in non-Gaussian environments, this work provides actionable insights for the warfighter to maintain operational superiority in the dynamic battlegrounds of the future."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the critical need for accurate and early detection methods. This study presents an innovative technique for lung cancer diagnostics that integrates hybrid deep learning algorithms with advanced image processing methods. The proposed methodology includes a thorough pipeline that begins with data collection and preprocessing, proceeds with noise reduction via filtering, segmentation through advanced clustering algorithms, feature extraction and selection, and concludes with classification utilising a hybrid deep learning model. Some important contributions are the creation of a complete preprocessing and filtering framework that enhances picture quality, the use of hybrid K-means and Fuzzy C-means clustering for precise segmentation, and the extraction of radiomic characteristics to pinpoint important patterns. We present a new hybrid classification model that uses 10-fold cross-validation to improve detection accuracy. This model combines Crow Search, Locust Assist, Boolean Grey Wolf, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The findings indicate a significant improvement in detection precision and dependability relative to current techniques. The suggested hybrid method demonstrates enhanced performance, underscoring its applicability in lung cancer diagnostics. This discovery improves lung cancer detection and lays the groundwork for future investigations involving hybrid deep learning as well as image processing techniques."

Although recent studies have proposed resource-aware mechanisms and failure-aware models to improve the resilience of machine learning systems at the edge, many overlook deployment overheads that impede the adoption of these approaches. In this paper, we highlight practical considerations that affect failure-detection and recovery times and analyze how these considerations shape system design.

Ensuring real-time transmission of heterogeneous data flows in IWNs is both critical and challenging. This paper addresses the hybrid transmission problem of time-triggered (TT) and event-triggered (ET) flows. The conventional periodic-compact scheduling (PCS) allocates TT flow in a back-to-back manner, without fully accounting for the deadline requirement of ET flow. In this paper, we propose a multi-interval scheduling (MIS) scheme designed to distribute TT flow uniformly within hyper-period, thereby reducing excessive waiting time of ET flow. Furthermore, we theoretically derive and analyze the expected waiting time for ET flow under both scheduling schemes. Finally, through extensive experiments, we analyze the impact of factors including the number of TT flows and idle interval length on schedulability and waiting time."

While 5G AKA improves upon previous generations by concealing subscriber identities, it remains vulnerable to replay-based synchronization and linkability threats under realistic adversary models. This paper provides a unified analysis of the standardized 5G AKA flow, identifying several vulnerabilities and highlighting how each exploits protocol behavior to compromise user privacy. To address these risks, we present five lightweight mitigation strategies. We demonstrate through prototype implementation and testing that these enhancements strengthen resilience against linkability attacks with minimal computational and signaling overhead. Among the solutions studied, those introducing a UE-generated nonce emerge as the most promising, effectively neutralizing the identified tracking and correlation attacks with negligible additional overhead. Integrating this extension as an optional feature to the standard 5G AKA protocol offers a backward-compatible, low-overhead path toward a more privacy-preserving authentication framework for both commercial and military 5G deployments."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes TEDR-YNet, an innovative Y-shaped dual-encoder network for the segmentation of diabetic retinopathy lesions. This network utilizes a dual-encoder architecture to capture features from different representations, significantly enhancing the model’s expressive capability. In the bottleneck layer, a meticulously designed lesion-aware enhancement module is introduced to improve multi-scale lesion perception and boundary segmentation accuracy.Askip connection mechanism with gated convolution is innovatively incorporated to strengthen the model’s focus on lesion regions. An edge enhancement module is further employed to optimize boundary segmentation performance, and a hybrid loss function is designed to effectively mitigate the class imbalance problem. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets IDRID, DDR, and TJDR demonstrate the superior performance of TEDR-YNet, achieving average Dice coefficients of 68.61%, 58.51%, and 58.14%, respectively. These results represent improvements of 11.47%, 7.15%, and 9.8% over the baseline UNet model. Additionally, the mIOU metrics on the three datasets reached 53.24%, 46.84%, and 44.43%, respectively. These findings robustly demonstrate the precision and robustness of TEDR-YNet in multi-lesion segmentation for diabetic retinopathy, offering strong technical support for clinical diagnostic assistance."

Unlike conventional attacks such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and multi-step Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), which can perturb all feature dimensions, our DeepSHAP-guided masked-PGD approach focuses its updates on a small set of highly influential features while still achieving competitive success rates on the X-IIoTID dataset. Experimental results indicate that it yields lower autoencoder-based reconstruction error and uses much sparser perturbations, making its adversarial examples harder to detect. By systematically varying the perturbation budget and the number of targeted features, we show the trade-off between stealth and effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the difficulty of detecting adversarial examples guided by feature importance."

However, existing unsupervised monocular depth estimation (UMDE) methods struggle with photometric inconsistencies and lack robustness in complex endoscopic environments due to the absence of ground truth depth data. In this work, we propose an efficient UMDE framework tailored for endoscopic imaging, featuring an optimized MobileNetV2-based encoder integrated with a First-order Variation Layer (V-layer) to enhance texture and edge representation. Additionally, we incorporate structural pruning to compress the model, reducing its parameters from 5M to 1.25M (4.35× compression), while preserving accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces Absolute Relative (Abs Rel) loss by 27.6% compared to the baseline, enabling accurate and lightweight depth estimation suitable for real-time 3D reconstruction in minimally invasive surgery, as demonstrated on the SCARED dataset."

To this end, we propose a fuzzy logic-based robust fencing control scheme. First, fuzzy logic systems are employed to accurately approximate the unknown dynamics of the target, enhancing adaptability and prediction accuracy. Second, a resilient control strategy is developed to accommodate potential actuator faults, thereby mitigating their impact and ensuring closed-loop stability and desired control performance. Furthermore, a dual-sided fencing mechanism is introduced using signed graphs, which enables agents from different subgroups to coordinate from opposite directions, thereby forming an efficient and symmetric enclosure around the target. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fencing control scheme."

Rugged terrain significantly alters the radiative transfer among the solar-terrain-sensor, resulting in large errors in quantitative remote sensing reflectance retrieval in mountainous regions. In this paper, a stepwise bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)-based land surface reflectance (SBLSR) model that decouples atmospheric and terrain influences is proposed. SBLSR leverages four-stream radiative transfer theory and mountainous radiative transfer principles to retrieve the reflectance of land surfaces under non-Lambertian conditions. This stepwise framework allows for input from either top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance or surface reflectance products that neglect topographic effects.

    "abstract": "People often stick to their existing beliefs, ignoring contradicting evidence or only interacting with those who reinforce their views. This tendency, referred to as being rigid in one's beliefs, is often driven by one's emotional connection to their beliefs and worsened by social media platforms which promote highly personalized content to maximize user engagement. As increased belief rigidity can negatively impact decisions, it is crucial to study and design interventions to reduce belief rigidity in online social networks. We design an experimental framework to passively infer belief rigidity and empirically quantify the effects of introducing randomness into the network structure as an intervention strategy. We recruit 163 participants into two conditions: one emulating traditional online platforms and the other more random. Our results suggest that individuals' beliefs are influenced by peer opinions, regardless of whether those opinions are similar to or differ from their own. Moreover, people are more likely to incorporate peers with (slightly) differing opinions into their networks when the recommendations are more randomized. Our findings highlight the need for future exploration into how design interventions can shape people's psycho-social functionalities in online social platforms."

Firstly, the variation range of measured sequence component impedance angle is theoretically analyzed to reveal the limitations of negative sequence directional pilot protection and positive sequence fault component-based directional pilot protection in feeders with T-connected IIDGs and loads. Then, a low voltage ride through control strategy of IIDG considering the action characteristics of positive sequence fault component-based directional pilot protection is proposed. In the positive sequence fault component network, the variation range of IIDG’s equivalent impedance angle can meet the constraint for the correct operation of positive sequence fault component-based directional pilot protection. Simulation results show that the proposed protection scheme can correctly identify the internal and external faults in feeders with T-connected IIDGs and loads."

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item a user will interact with based on an analysis of their historical behaviors and interactions. Many Transformer-based methods embed items as dense vectors and utilize scaled dot-product attention to establish item relationships, resulting in impressive performance. However, most existing Transformer-based methods ignore the shopping intention, which is crucial for e-commerce platforms to improve customers' shopping experience. In addition, since the user behavior sequences often exhibit diversity and uncertainty, it is difficult for dot-product self-attention to capture this uncertainty. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a Distributed-based User Purchase Characteristics Network (DUPCN) that embeds each item and it's attribute as a Gaussian distribution to mine distributed user purchase characteristics. Unlike existing Gaussian/distributional SR models that only model the uncertainty of intra-sequence item transitions based on user behavior sequences, DUPCN constructs an intent-oriented dual-source distribution by fusing user behavior sequences and multimodal item attributes (such as price, category, color). This enables DUPCN to mine potential shopping intentions from the distribution. Specifically, to obtain the feature representation of item sequences and their attributes, strengthen users' personal purchasing preferences, and weaken uninteresting items and attributes, the Wasserstein Transformer based on Item Relationship Graph which measures attentions as scaled Wasserstein distances between items to discover potential associations between different items (item attributes). Furthermore, the Feature Fusion module is designed to align learned shopping intent with user preferences through JS-divergence minimization. The experiments on four large normal benchmark datasets show that DUPCN has excellent performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods, especially in solving the short sequences.

The label confusion model generates simulated label distributions by calculating the causal correlations between text vector representations and labels at each level, thereby guiding the initial prediction results and improving prediction accuracy. To further reduce noise introduction, a label-guided attention mechanism is designed to enable the model to focus better on features related to the target labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits superior performance on established classification benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the causal modeling approach in multi-label text classification tasks."

Given that the presence of attacks can compromise the integrity and availability of data, as well as the critical role of switching signals in shaping the behavior of switched systems, a novel event-driven distributed filter is explored in scenarios where the switching signal of the controller experiences a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, characterized by bounded attack frequency and duration. It is significant to mention that the persistent and recurrent nature of attacks compromises the transmission of switching signals, resulting in significant asynchronous discrepancies between the switching of the filtering error system (FES) and the controller. To address the asynchronous behavior induced by DoS attacks, a piecewise time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (PTLKF) tailored to the characteristics of DTSDSs is proposed.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for spectrum necessitates the shared use of frequency bands between commercial wireless systems and incumbent radar operations. The 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band in the United States is a prime example where 5G New Radio (NR) deployments must coexist with federal radar systems. This paper explores the relationship between pulsed sensor interference, particularly its Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), and the resulting effects on 5G downlink throughput. We present a comprehensive research approach combining a simulation framework utilizing open-source 5G software stacks and custom radar modeling in MATLAB, validated by over-the-air (OTA) experiments with a commercial UE and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). Our findings demonstrate that 5G and radar coexistence is achievable under certain conditions, and critically, not all radar interference scenarios result in complete blockage of 5G communications. The simulations reveal that for low radar PRFs (below 3 kHz) and under 15% duty cycle, strategic adjustment of 5G symbol-based scheduling can lead to notable improvements in downlink throughput. Furthermore, the results from our real-world OTA testing show good alignment with the simulation outcomes, confirming the viability of our modeling approach. This work identifies specific sensor PRF ranges that are more conducive to cellular coexistence and highlights the potential for preserving 5G performance under high duty cycle conditions by adapting TTI boundaries and symbol allocations."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) or intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links between base stations (BS) and users, thereby significantly enhancing the BS coverage. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) can split incident signals into reflected and transmitted signals pointing to different half spaces simultaneously, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna BS transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is particularly difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solutions to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the more general multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases."

In this work, a Delay-Optimized Backpressure (DOBP) routing algorithm is proposed, which integrates queue backlog and path residual delay into link weight, optimizes delay via dynamic bandwidth allocation, and avoids flow starvation with a minimum load factor. Lyapunov function-based analysis confirms its throughput optimality. Simulations show DOBP outperforms existing methods in higher throughput, lower end-to-end delay, better load balancing, and stronger stability for LEO networks."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass density is essential for quantifying terrestrial carbon exchange. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR mission has ushered in a new era of high-quality aboveground biomass density (AGBD) estimation from space. Owing to GEDI's LiDAR data collection, one of the GEDI AGBD products are presented as 1 km spatial discontinuity grids, limiting practical application. This study proposes a method based on machine learning and deep learning to estimate spatio-temporally continuous GEDI AGBD and its associated uncertainty (standard error) during 2015-2020 using multi-source optical, SAR, LiDAR, topographic, and climatic data. MODIS vegetation continuous field (VCF) was used as an indicator to select unchanged GEDI AGBD samples in 2020 for each year from 2015 to 2020, resulting in 1,800–2,400 samples per year. The selected annual training samples were then used to estimate annual spatially continuous GEDI AGBD and uncertainty. Experiments in China's Han River Basin demonstrated that integrating all available datasets resulted in a more accurate spatial continuous GEDI AGBD map in 2020 compared to use any single dataset. Convolutional neural network (CNN) considering spatial neighboring information (CNN_spatial) outperformed 1-D CNN and four benchmark machine learning methods of extreme learning machines (ELM), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) with an R2 of 0.8232 and RMSE of 27.7557. Using the unchanged GEDI AGBD training samples resulted in more accurate GEDI AGBD maps (R2>0.82) during 2015-2020 than using the training samples from 2020 alone. From 2015 to 2020, 2.16% of AGBD pixels in Han River Basin experienced a relatively significant increase, while 1.24% showed a relatively significant decrease. Compared with the ESA_CCI and China's AGBD products, our estimates achieve better accuracy relative to the field plot data. The proposed method offers a solution to generate high-quality spatio-temporally continuous GEDI AGBD in large-scale complex forest landscapes."

The continuous processes of sensing, transmission, and computation significantly drain energy, highlighting the necessity for efficient energy management strategies. Clustering techniques are extensively employed to enhance energy distribution and prolong the lifespan of networks. The proposed Hybrid <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GWO-PSO</i> presents an innovative method that merges Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to create an energy-efficient cluster-based routing technique. GWO is employed for the effective selection of cluster heads (CH), taking into account factors like the node’s residual energy, distances to the base station and other nodes, as well as transmission energy. PSO enhances cluster formation by considering intra-cluster distance, node density, and remaining energy, thereby optimizing data transmission and the selection of relay nodes. Thorough simulations assess the proposed approach based on metrics such as network stability, data dissemination, dead nodes, active nodes, packets transmitted to the base station, and CH selection for each round. The results show notable enhancements in network longevity and energy efficiency when compared to conventional methods, confirming the efficacy of the proposed approach."

Since this system can subject to various disturbances (environment) and diseases (COPD, pneumonia, asthma, COVID 19), it raises the question of quality diagnostics. This review considers non-invasive methods of respiratory monitoring that use the following sensors: piezoresistive, inductive, piezoelectric, impedance, accelerometer, gyroscope, acoustic, thermistor, temperature, pressure, humidity, ECG, PPG. The last two sensors produce cardiovascular diagnoses, but with certain methods it is possible to extract the respiratory component. In addition, the devices (pneumotachograph and spirometer), which are references for the diagnosis of the respiratory system, are considered. As a result of this study, the following were considered: sensors and devices were reviewed with examples of their use; direct measurements were highlighted; and the analysis of each sensor considered showed that, with proper setup and calibration, an acceptably comparable result to reference devices can achieve."

    "abstract": "Frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) are arrays of conductive elements or apertures that exhibit frequency-dependent reflection and transmission properties. Their electromagnetic response is influenced by geometry and environmental conditions, making them attractive for wireless strain-sensing applications. However, temperature variations can produce frequency shifts similar to those caused by strain, reducing measurement accuracy. This work investigates the effects of intrinsic temperature compensation on two common FSS unit cell geometries—loop and patch–through comprehensive simulation analysis. The results show that loop-based cells offer superior thermal stability, while patch-based cells provide greater strain sensitivity, illustrating the trade-off between thermal robustness and mechanical responsiveness. A patch-type FSS strain sensor was designed, fabricated, and characterized under varying temperature and strain. The sensor achieves a strain sensitivity of 150 MHz per 1 %εl, while temperature-induced drift is limited to 12 MHz over a 200∘C range, confirming the effectiveness of the intrinsic compensation strategy. The results provide valuable insights for optimizing FSS-based sensor design in structural health monitoring applications and balancing thermal stability with mechanical sensitivity to ensure reliable performance in thermally dynamic environments."

In this paper, we propose to generate high-quality and context-aware 3D motion sequences by integrating diffusion generative modelling with transformer-based temporal encoding. Our hybrid Diffusion–Transformer architecture is conditioned on inputs such as text prompts or trajectory waypoints, and predicts denoised motion samples at each diffusion step to make it possible to incorporate geometric and semantic losses. Outputs are further refined by lightweight physical plausibility (inverse kinematics, foot-contact correction) to minimize sliding and floating artifacts. We train on the publicly available HumanML3D (a variant of AMASS) dataset and evaluate on animation-grade sequences. Comparative experiments with up-to-date baselines demonstrate 37 % reduction of FID, and 7 % improvement for R-Precision as well as the gains in contact accuracy and smoothness. The qualitative results verify that the model is capable of producing natural, temporally consistent and semantically relevant movements. This framework presents the convergence of generative AI and production-level animation requirements, while providing a path to controllable, physically-sound, and efficient motion synthesis."

We also present an autoencoder model integrated with these loss functions and evaluate its performance using the CIC-IDS2017 (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity – Intrusion Detection System) dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves intrusion detection accuracy by up to 44% for different types of attacks compared to a baseline autoencoder based on standard L1 loss."

Conventional hiring practices mostly use keyword-based matching, which frequently misses opportunities and is inefficient because it doesn't capture the semantic meaning of resumes and job descriptions. This paper proposes a web-based AI framework that combines adaptive job recommendation, course suggestion mechanisms, and resume semantics to overcome these constraints. The suggested system parses resumes into structured formats, matches them with appropriate job postings, and extracts contextual features using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic similarity models like BERT. The system suggests skill-enhancing courses based on the candidate's profile when there are no suitable job openings; these courses can be either free or paid. Through the acquisition of skills relevant to the industry and increased eligibility for future employment opportunities, this dual recommendation strategy guarantees that candidates maintain their competitiveness. Additionally, the framework includes adaptive learning mechanisms that improve course and job recommendations in response to input from candidates and recruiters. Increased job matching accuracy, less work for recruiters, better candidate satisfaction, and increased employability through guided upskilling are all anticipated results."

    "abstract": "As a cost-effective weapon in APT attacks, ransomware disrupts victims’ business operations by stealing or encrypting data, posing serious cybersecurity threats. To counter such threats, many studies adopt API sequences for detection, as they capture complete software executions. However, ransomware variants can exploit insufficient feature correlation ability in detection models to evade detection by inserting perturbations into API sequences. This paper proposes SERA, a method for analyzing ransomware from a high-level behavioral perspective wihch is more resilient to perturbations. SERA combines a novel cross-graph relation learning mechanism with a customized Skip-gram algorithm to mine two key relationships within API sequences and automatically extract semantic-enhanced behaviors through a behavior extraction algorithm. Experiments on 1,934 SERA’s behavior sequences demonstrate that SERA is a scalable approach for ransomware analysis, and can preserve software execution semantics the same as API sequences. When integrated into five existing ransomware detection models, SERA improves their average accuracy by 13.11% and reduces the average false positive rate by 16.08%."

    "abstract": "Ensuring robust semantic preservation under noisy channel conditions remains a fundamental challenge in semantic communication. Most existing approaches, which rely on either pixel-level reconstruction loss or task-specific supervision, often fail to maintain semantic consistency when faced with both channel noise and inherent semantic distortions. In this work, we introduce Energy-Calibrated Semantic Communication (ECSC), an end-to-end framework that integrates a multi-scale U-Net-based autoencoder for hierarchical feature learning, lightweight compression-decompression modules for efficient transmission, and a trainable energy-based model (EBM) for semantic calibration. ECSC enforces hierarchical alignment through energy-weighted image reconstruction, multi-scale feature reconstruction, sparsity regularization, and energy-calibrated semantic preservation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 over AWGN channels demonstrate ECSC’s superiority in low-SNR scenarios, delivering improved semantic fidelity, reconstruction quality, and robustness to both channel noise and semantic distortions compared to existing approaches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sunway677/ECSC."

    "abstract": "In Himalayan region, the Glacial lake outburst flood(GLOF) is a major concern, by which thousands of glacial lakes created due to glacier melt in the various states of India like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir, and Arunachal Pradesh, as well as Union Territories like Ladakh with high Himalayas and other high snow mountain ranges. They are especially vulnerable, highlighting the need for robust monitoring and mitigation strategies. This paper focuses on using Deep Learning (DL) models for detecting and segmenting glacial lakes to mitigate GLOF risks. Using the Glacial Lakes Detection Dataset from High-Mountain Asia, covering 2080.12 km<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, we selected 1,200 cloud-free true-color images with ground truth masks. Our study evaluates DL models like DeepLabV3+ and U-Net for lake segmentation and classification. Experimental results demonstrated model proficiency, with DeepLabV3+ (ResNet50 backbone and Dice loss function) achieving the highest IoU score of 74.69% with 90%accuracy along with 98% with U-Net + EfficientNetB0. Our study highlights the capacity of DL-based systems for enhanced GLOF monitoring and early warning."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) into an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) for 5G systems, with a focus on optimizing beamforming through User Equipment (UE) reporting. The integration method is demonstrated in a field test where RIS dynamically adjusts its beamforming configuration based on real-time feedback from the UE, specifically using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) data. The results show significant improvements in signal strength and throughput, validating the effectiveness of RIS in enhancing network performance without requiring modifications to existing network protocols. This work highlights the potential of RIS to improve coverage and capacity in 5G environments."

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder marked by recurrent and random seizures that adversely affect the health and normal functioning of a human. To have good clinical assessment and management, there is a need to have good seizure detection. This paper presents a computer software application scheme of epileptic Seizure detection with reference to the electroencephalogram (EEG) records in CSV file format. EEG recordings are cleaned up with noise filtering, normalization and segmentation to ensure there is data consistency. Thereafter, it is trained on an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning network to learn the temporal variation of the EEG signals and distinguish the presence of seizures and non-seizures. It is noted that the proposed system achieves a 98.6 % accuracy and a sensitivity of 98.4, which is a good performance regarding seizure pattern recognition. It will be a useful, computationally efficient method of seizure detection using EEG that can be relied upon to develop a tool that can be accessible to both clinical and research practice regarding managing the problem of epilepsy."
