    "abstract": "This paper challenges the dominance of continuous pipelines in visual generation. We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

    "abstract": "The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/"

    "abstract": "Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

In response, we introduce Next-Gen CAPTCHAs, a scalable defense framework designed to secure the next-generation web against the advanced agents. Unlike static datasets, our benchmark is built upon a robust data generation pipeline, allowing for large-scale and easily scalable evaluations, notably, for backend-supported types, our system is capable of generating effectively unbounded CAPTCHA instances. We exploit the persistent human-agent \"Cognitive Gap\" in interactive perception, memory, decision-making, and action. By engineering dynamic tasks that require adaptive intuition rather than granular planning, we re-establish a robust distinction between biological users and artificial agents, offering a scalable and diverse defense mechanism for the agentic era."

We apply our interpolation to constrained packing problems and Delsarte theory, where one uses positive definite functions on homogeneous spaces to obtain bounds on various packing problems. We prove the specific positive definite function witnesses that a code is sharp for constrained angle codes must be from polynomials."

    "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence can be viewed as an evolution of data-driven learning paradigms, with successive shifts in data organization and utilization continuously driving advances in model capability. Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."

    "abstract": "We propose Next Concept Prediction (NCP), a generative pretraining paradigm built on top of Next Token Prediction (NTP). NCP predicts discrete concepts that span multiple tokens, thereby forming a more challenging pretraining objective. Our model, ConceptLM, quantizes hidden states using Vector Quantization and constructs a concept vocabulary. It leverages both NCP and NTP to drive parameter updates and generates a concept to guide the generation of the following tokens. We train ConceptLM from scratch at scales ranging from 70M to 1.5B parameters with up to 300B training data, including Pythia and GPT-2 backbones. Results on 13 benchmarks show that NCP yields consistent performance gains over traditional token-level models. Furthermore, continual pretraining experiments on an 8B-parameter Llama model indicate that NCP can further improve an NTP-trained model. Our analysis suggests that NCP leads to more powerful language models by introducing a harder pretraining task, providing a promising path toward better language modeling."

    "abstract": "We study the impact of a major policy and design change at Lyft that altered both driver earnings and platform transparency, offering insights into how such changes affect stakeholders and platform outcomes. In February 2024, Lyft began a staggered rollout of a new policy that guaranteed drivers a minimum share of rider payments and increased transparency by displaying estimated earnings per ride upfront. This policy was first introduced in major urban markets, creating a natural experiment to evaluate its effects. Using data from over 47 million rides across urban and neighboring suburban markets, we apply dynamic staggered difference-in-differences and geographic border strategies to measure causal effects on driver behavior, rider experience, and platform performance. We find the policy significantly increased driver engagement-particularly among those with lower pre-policy earnings or higher income uncertainty-leading to more hours worked, higher utilization, and greater trip volume. These supply-side changes also generated positive spillovers on rider demand. We disentangle the separate effects of earnings guarantees and transparency and show that while both were beneficial, transparency may have also triggered strategic driver behaviors. In ongoing work, we develop a counterfactual simulation framework linking driver supply and rider intents to ride production, showing how small behavioral shifts could further amplify platform outcomes. We also train a self-supervised model on driver trajectories to detect multihoming, examining whether the observed supply increase reflects net expansion or substitution from other platforms. Together, our findings highlight the potential for platform-led policies to serve as alternatives to regulation and offer design insights for managing platform change."

Research-grade systems extend this coverage under certain circumstances, but for most languages coverage remains patchy or nonexistent. This position paper argues that this situation is largely self-imposed. In particular, it arises from a persistent framing of LID as decontextualized text classification, which obscures the central role of prior probability estimation and is reinforced by institutional incentives that favor global, fixed-prior models. We argue that improving coverage for tail languages requires rethinking LID as a routing problem and developing principled ways to incorporate environmental cues that make languages locally plausible."

Unlike existing frameworks tailored only for artificial intelligence agents, pixelLOG also enables human behavioral tracking in multi-player/multi-agent environments. Operating at configurable frequencies up to and exceeding 20 updates per second, the system captures comprehensive behavioral data through a hybrid approach of active state polling and passive event monitoring. By leveraging Spigot's extensible API, pixelLOG facilitates robust session isolation and produces structured JSON outputs integrable with standard analytical pipelines. This framework bridges the gap between decontextualized laboratory assessments and richer, more ecologically valid tasks, enabling high-resolution analysis of cognitive processes as they unfold in complex, virtual environments."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (OV-KWS) enables personalized device control via arbitrary voice commands. Recently, researchers have explored using audio-text joint embeddings, allowing users to enroll phrases with text, and proposed techniques to disambiguate similar utterances. We find that existing OV-KWS solutions often overly bias the beginning phonemes of an enrollment, causing false triggers when negative enrollment-query-pairs share a prefix (``turn the volume up'' vs. ``turn the volume down''). We trace this to two factors: training data bias and position-biased cross-modal scoring. To address these limitations, we introduce the Partial Overlap Benchmark (POB) with two datasets, POB-Spark and POB-LibriPhrase (POB-LP), containing mismatched audio-text pairs with shared prefixes, and propose Equal-weighting Position Scoring (EPS), a lightweight decision layer. Using EPS alone reduces EER on POB-Spark from 64.4\\% to 29.3\\% and improves POB-LP accuracy from 87.6\\% to 96.8\\%, while maintaining performance on LibriPhrase and Google Speech Commands (GSC). With POB data added in training, our work achieves the best POB benchmark results while incurring the least amount of degradation on prior metrics among baselines. This degradation is most pronounced in GSC, which contains only one-word commands. We surface mitigating this trade-off as future work."

    "abstract": "The black hole X-ray binary 4U 1755$-$338 underwent an outburst in 2020 after 25 years of quiescence. The comprehensive spectral analysis revealed that the system has a low interstellar neutral hydrogen column density of $0.34\\pm0.01 \\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outburst began with a low mass-accretion rate and was characterized as a low-luminosity outburst. The radius of the inner accretion disc remained constant throughout the outburst. Additionally, a growing neutral medium with constant density was detected in the local environment of 4U 1755$-$338.The hardness-intensity diagram (HID) did not follow the standard q-shaped pattern, indicating a non-canonical outburst. Instead, the HID showed a correlated evolution of hardness and source flux, suggesting a thermal disc origin of the flux. A wideband spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous NICER-NuSTAR data in two frameworks, based on kerrbb and bhspec. The results of bhspec (kerrbb) based modeling indicate that 4U 1755$-$338 is a high-inclination system, $67.44_{-3.03}^{+9.75}$ ($75.25_{-4.68}^{+5.59}$) degrees, and harbors a moderately spinning black hole with a spin parameter of $0.78_{-0.14}^{+0.02}$ ($0.50_{-0.43}^{+0.19}$) and a mass of $3.37_{-1.04}^{+0.45} (3.28_{-1.1}^{+1.7})M_{\\odot}$ respectively. The inferred key parameters: black hole mass, spin, and system inclination are consistent across both modeling approaches. No reflection features were detected in the spectra of 4U 1755$-$338. The high spectral index, the blackbody nature ($L\\propto T^4$) of the hardness ratio, the absence of reflection signatures, and the weak variability in the power density spectra indicate that the source remained in the high/soft state throughout the outburst."

To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement."

Current interpretations rely on descriptive catalogues of molecules and reactions, obscuring how redox behaviour emerges from constrained biochemical organisation. Here, we present a mathematical theory of redox biology that resolves this gap by treating redox systems as finite, compositional, dynamical, and spatially embedded objects. We define a structured redox state space in which admissible molecular transformations form a neutral algebra of possibilities. Biological function emerges when this structure is embedded within a wider molecular network and interpreted through weighted flux distributions. Time-dependent reweighting of these transformations generates redox dynamics, while spatial embedding enforces locality and causality, yielding a distributed redox field. Within this framework, context dependence, nonlinearity, hysteresis, and memory arise naturally from bounded state spaces and irreversible transformations, without requiring ad hoc assumptions. This theory provides a working, predictive interpretative basis for redox biology: it constrains admissible states and trajectories, clarifies the meaning of redox measurements, and links chemical transformation to biological behaviour. Redox biology emerges as a geometric, dynamical process governed by lawful organisation."

We propose a zero-trust edge architecture implemented in a single programmable data-plane pipeline that unifies four modules: external spoofing, internal spoofing, external flooding, and internal flooding. A key design choice is to enforce identity plausibility before rate plausibility: stateless per-packet validation filters spoofed traffic early so that time-window statistics for flooding operate on credible identities. We outline a concrete P4 design (prefix Hop-Limit bands, DAD-anchored address-port bindings, and Count-Min Sketch windowed counting) and evaluate it across a systematic 15-scenario suite spanning single-, dual-, and multi-vector compositions.

We propose and evaluate the LLM-based (GPT-4o) approach \"DeepQuali\", for assessing and improving requirements quality in agile software development. We applied it to projects in two small companies, where we compared LLM-based quality assessments with expert judgments. Experts also participated in walkthroughs of the solution, provided feedback, and rated their acceptance of the approach. Experts largely agreed with the LLM's quality assessments, especially regarding overall ratings and explanations. However, they did not always agree with the other experts on detailed ratings, suggesting that expertise and experience may influence judgments. Experts recognized the usefulness of the approach but criticized the lack of integration into their workflow. LLMs show potential in supporting software engineers with the quality assessment and improvement of requirements. The explicit use of quality models and explanatory feedback increases acceptance."

We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various graph-based tasks but remain highly sensitive to distribution shifts. In this work, we focus on a prevalent yet under-explored phenomenon in graph generalization, Minimal Shift Flip (MSF),where test samples that slightly deviate from the training distribution are abruptly misclassified. To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that E2A consistently improves graph OOD generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "The accuracy of machine learning interatomic potentials suffers from reference data that contains numerical noise. Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes."

This framework makes it possible to reason in the context of each of these combinations and extensions, but also to study in a unified way the satisfiability decision and its complexity. In particular, we establish two complementary theorems guaranteeing that the satisfiability decision is polynomial, and we use them to recover the known results of the size-topology combination. We also generalize the main definition of qualitative formalism to include qualitative formalisms excluded from the definitions of the literature, important in the context of combinations."

While the nodal-curves of the former are taken to lie along the $k_z = 0$-plane, the nodal points of the latter harbour dipoles in their Berry-curvature (BC) profile, with the dipole's axis aligned along the $k_z$-axis. All these systems are topological and are unified on the aspect that their bands possess a vanishing Chern number. The linear response, $σ_{zz}$, is obtained from an exact solution when the systems are subjected to collinear electric and magnetic fields applied along the anisotropy axis, viz. $\\boldsymbol{\\hat z}$. The nonlinear part involves third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the electrical current to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field. We analyse the similarities of the response arising from the vortex nodal-rings and the Hopf semimetals, which can be traced to the dipole-like sources in their BC fields."

    "abstract": "How do social animals make effective decisions in the absence of a leader? While coordination can improve accuracy, it also delays responses as information propagates through the group. In changing environments, these delays can outweigh the benefits of centralized control, making decentralized strategies advantageous in large groups. This raises a key question: how can groups implement efficient collective decisions without central coordination? We address this question using a model of collective foraging in which individuals choose whether to invest in costly exploration or remain idle, while sharing information and rewards across the group. We show that decentralized collectives can match the performance of centrally controlled groups through a division of labor: a small, heterogeneous subset explores even when expected rewards are negative, while a synchronized majority forages only when expected rewards are positive. Information redundancy causes the optimal scout number to grow sublinearly with group size, so that larger groups need proportionally fewer explorers. The heterogeneity of the group is maximized at intermediate ecological pressures, but optimal groups are homogeneous when costs or environmental contrasts or fluctuations are extreme. Crucially, these group-level policies do not require central coordination, emerging instead from agents following simple threshold-based decision rules. We thus demonstrate a mechanism through which leaderless collectives can make effective decisions under uncertainty and show how ecological pressures can drive changes in the distribution of strategies employed by the group."

Moreover, existing agentic recommendation systems predominantly leverages semantic knowledge while neglecting the collaborative filtering (CF) signals essential for implicit preference modeling. To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model. Extensive experiments on Amazon and MIND datasets show that AMEM4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolving memory-guided collaborative filtering."

To mitigate this, we introduce Joint Preference Alignment and Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning (PPRL). Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content.

    "abstract": "An impurity hosting a magnetic moment coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor gives rise to so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $π$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $π$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $π$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $π$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length."

Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility."

    "abstract": "The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause)."

Memory expansion via Compute Express Link (CXL) is an effective way to provide additional memory at lower cost and power, but its effective use requires software-level tiering for hyperscaler workloads. Existing tiering solutions, including current Linux support, face fundamental limitations in production deployments. First, they lack multi-tenancy support, failing to handle stacked homogeneous or heterogeneous workloads. Second, limited control-plane flexibility leads to fairness violations and performance variability. Finally, insufficient observability prevents operators from diagnosing performance pathologies at scale. We present Equilibria, an OS framework enabling fair, multi-tenant CXL tiering at datacenter scale. Equilibria provides per-container controls for memory fair-share allocation and fine-grained observability of tiered-memory usage and operations. It further enforces flexible, user-specified fairness policies through regulated promotion and demotion, and mitigates noisy-neighbor interference by suppressing thrashing. Evaluated in a large hyperscaler fleet using production workloads and benchmarks, Equilibria helps workloads meet service level objectives (SLOs) while avoiding performance interference. It improves performance over the state-of-the-art Linux solution, TPP, by up to 52% for production workloads and 1.7x for benchmarks. All Equilibria patches have been released to the Linux community."

We present CryptoGen, the first system to enable scalable privacy-preserving neural generation with persistent encrypted key-value (KV) cache reuse. Discriminative-task secure inference systems incur quadratic latency and memory growth when adapted to autoregressive decoding due to the lack of native encrypted KV-cache support. In contrast, CryptoGen achieves near-linear scaling by securely reusing and updating encrypted KV caches throughout generation. CryptoGen integrates homomorphic encryption and secret sharing to support both prefilling and generation. Key techniques include a unified encrypted KV-cache framework, heterogeneous SIMD encodings for different phases, optimized cipher-cipher matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations, and efficient noise refresh and ciphertext concatenation mechanisms. Evaluation on generative Transformer models trained on WikiText-2, PTB, and LAMBADA shows that for input lengths of 128-512 tokens, CryptoGen achieves 4.4x-7.6x lower per-token latency than state-of-the-art discriminative secure inference systems, while maintaining near-linear latency and memory scaling, with advantages increasing for longer sequences.

    "abstract": "Microquasars are primary candidates for Galactic PeVatrons, yet their collective contribution to the cosmic ray (CR) ``knee\" remains poorly understood. We investigate this contribution by simulating anisotropic diffusive propagation through the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Our results demonstrate that the GMF establishes a transport regime where magnetic connectivity between sources and the solar neighborhood determines the local flux. Active sources aligned with local GMF lines, such as Cygnus X-1, exhibit significant flux enhancements, while magnetically disconnected sources, such as V616 Mon, are strongly suppressed. By integrating source evolution with anisotropic transport, we show that the observed proton bump at the CR ``knee\" is best reproduced by the cumulative contribution of microquasar remnants, which is often dominated by a few nearby or recent events, rather than the active ones alone. We find that a harder injection spectrum allows CRs from remnants to reproduce the PeV bump after propagation, as low-energy CRs have sufficient time to accumulate while high-energy CRs escape the Galactic plane. Our findings suggest that the integrated history of microquasar remnants, governed by the interplay of source age and magnetic connectivity, is the primary driver populating the observed CR ``knee''."

This structure supports flexible, high-dimensional modeling of complex dependence patterns, as commonly found in spatiotemporal phenomena, where computational challenges arise rapidly with increasing dimensions. The proposed approach further manages exact inference through predictive stacking, enhancing accuracy and interoperability. Combining sequential and parallel processing of temporal shards, each unit passes assimilated information forward, then back-smoothed to improve posterior estimates, incorporating all available information.

Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization. Notably, GISA provides complete human search trajectories for every query, offering gold-standard references for process-level supervision and imitation learning. Experiments on mainstream LLMs and commercial search products reveal that even the best-performing model achieves only 19.30\\% exact match score, with performance notably degrading on tasks requiring complex planning and comprehensive information gathering.

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."

    "abstract": "Flow-based generative models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. One option is to directly optimize the initial latent code (noise), such that the flow output solves the inverse problem. However, this requires backpropagating through the entire generative trajectory, incurring high memory costs and numerical instability. We propose MS-Flow, which represents the trajectory as a sequence of intermediate latent states rather than a single initial code. By enforcing the flow dynamics locally and coupling segments through trajectory-matching penalties, MS-Flow alternates between updating intermediate latent states and enforcing consistency with observed data. This reduces memory consumption while improving reconstruction quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MS-Flow over existing methods on image recovery and inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, and computed tomography."

Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency."

From a symmetry analysis of the phonon eigenmodes, we identify eight Raman-active modes that can couple directly to the Er$^{3+}$ crystal-field operators, including a low-energy $B_g$ mode at 9.1 meV that is expected to play a dominant role in phonon-assisted spin-lattice relaxation.

Despite its significance in industrial applications such as fraud detection and user segmentation, a significant chasm persists between academic research and real-world deployment. Current evaluation protocols suffer from the small-scale, high-homophily citation datasets, non-scalable full-batch training paradigms, and a reliance on supervised metrics that fail to reflect performance in label-scarce environments. To bridge these gaps, we present PyAGC, a comprehensive, production-ready benchmark and library designed to stress-test AGC methods across diverse scales and structural properties. We unify existing methodologies into a modular Encode-Cluster-Optimize framework and, for the first time, provide memory-efficient, mini-batch implementations for a wide array of state-of-the-art AGC algorithms. Our benchmark curates 12 diverse datasets, ranging from 2.7K to 111M nodes, specifically incorporating industrial graphs with complex tabular features and low homophily. Furthermore, we advocate for a holistic evaluation protocol that mandates unsupervised structural metrics and efficiency profiling alongside traditional supervised metrics. Battle-tested in high-stakes industrial workflows at Ant Group, this benchmark offers the community a robust, reproducible, and scalable platform to advance AGC research towards realistic deployment. The code and resources are publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/Cloudy1225/PyAGC), PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pyagc), and Documentation (https://pyagc.readthedocs.io)."

An analogous result for the projective-to-Ricci-flat operator is obtained as well. The construction is based on a method, previously proposed by one of the authors, that leverages existing symmetries and geometric properties of the starting operator. In this case the compatibility complexes consist of, respectively, conformally and projectively invariant operators. We also make some comments on how Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand sequences can be interpreted as compatibility complexes in the locally flat case, which may be of general interest."

A model for bone healing in mouth would be useful for selecting proper surgical techniques in dental procedures. In this paper, the formulation and implementation of a model for Intramembranous Ossification is presented aiming to describe the complex process of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites. The model consists in a mathematical description of the mechanisms in which different types of cells interact, synthesize and degrade extra-cellular matrices under the influence of biochemical factors. Special attention is given to angiogenesis, oxygen-dependent effects and growth factor-induced apoptosis of fibroblasts. Furthermore, considering the depth-dependent vascularization of mandibular bone and its influence on bone healing, a functional description of the cell distribution on the severed periodontal ligament (PDL) is proposed. The developed model was implemented using the finite element method (FEM) and successfully validated by simulating an animal in-vivo experiment on dogs reported in the literature. A good fit between model outcome and experimental data was obtained with a mean absolute error of 3.04%. The mathematical framework presented here may represent an important tool for the design of future in-vitro and in-vivo tests, as well as a precedent for future in-silico studies on osseointegration and mechanobiology."

In a particular asymptotic setup entailing $n/p\\to \\text{constant}$, an i.i.d.~Gaussian $X$ matrix and linear sparsity, \\citet{su2017false} analyzed the Lasso selection path and presented negative results, showing that maintaining small levels of the false discovery proportion comes at a substantial cost in power. Followup work by \\citet{wang2020bridge} used the same framework to study the tradeoff between type I error and power for thresholded-Lasso selection, which ranks the variables based on the magnitude of the Lasso estimate instead of the order of appearance on the Lasso path, and demonstrated that significant improvements are possible if the regularization parameter is chosen appropriately. We take this line of research a step further, seeking an {\\em optimal} selection procedure in the AMP framework among procedures that order the variables by some univariate function of the Lasso estimate at a fixed value $λ$ of the regularization term. Observing that the model for the Lasso estimates effectively reduces asymptotically to a version of the well-studied two-groups model, we propose an empirical Bayes variable selection procedure based on an estimate of the local false discovery rate. We extend existing results in the AMP framework to obtain exact predictions for the curve describing the asymptotic tradeoff between type I error and power of this procedure. Additionally, we prove that the optimal $λ$ is the minimizer of the asymptotic mean squared error, and accordingly propose to use the empirical Bayes procedure with $λ$ estimated by cross-validation. The theoretical predictions imply that the gains in power can be substantial, and we confirm this by numerical studies under different settings."

    "abstract": "Text-to-motion generation, a rapidly evolving field in computer vision, aims to produce realistic and text-aligned motion sequences. Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences. Code is available at: https://caoyiyang1105.github.io/TriC-Motion/."

Within the light Majorana neutrino exchange mechanism, the decay amplitudes are found to emerge at the one-loop level, representing the long-range contribution. The extended-on-mass-shell scheme is employed to renormalize the one-loop amplitudes and restore consistent chiral power counting. Consequently, the differential decay rates for all accessible hyperon $0νββ$ channels are predicted and the corresponding branching ratios are more than 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bounds. Interestingly, it is found that the leading contribution to hyperon $0νββ$ decay is actually from short-range counterterm operators, as required by the renormalization argument. Neutrinoless transition form factors are proposed to determine this leading contribution through future lattice QCD simulations."

    "abstract": "Metalized-film capacitors (MFCs) employ polymer organic dielectrics like polypropylene (PP) and polyimide (PI), in which self-healing is seen as a key advantage. However, the performance of self-healing depends on specific chemical mechanisms involved. The formation of semiconductive carbonaceous soot represents a critical failure risk. This study investigates how oxygen atom impregnation through ozonation of the dielectric material tunes the composition and electrical conductivity of breakdown products in the PP and PI systems with aluminum-zinc electrodes. We revealed, at the atomistic level, that oxygen atoms tend to remove a fraction of carbon atoms from the semiconductive soot by oxidizing carbon into carbon monoxide in both polymers. In PP, oxygen fraction linearly increases gas mass fraction, thereby reducing soot fraction. In PI, the gas/soot ratio effect of oxygen content is less drastic, still clearly positive. The PP soot conductivity decreases uniformly as larger fractions of oxygen atoms are added. In turn, the PI conductivity drops to ~1500 S/m quickly. The PI soot exhibits narrower band gaps compared to that of PP. The oxygen fraction non-monotonically tailors band gaps, which generally increase. To summarize, ozonation enhances MFC reliability by increasing gas species fraction and reducing soot conductivity. We hereby provide numerical molecular-level insights to rationalize self-healing performance enhancement through polymer ozonation."

The underlying mechanism is the transient localization of a boson depletion cloud near the impurity, that oscillates around the boson density peak situated at the impurity position. The lifetime of this entangled oscillating state increases with the absolute value of the impurity-boson coupling. Cold atomic gases provide an ideal playground where this phenomenon can be probed."

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/μ$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D>0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \\to 0$ and $D \\to \\infty$ respectively.

    "abstract": "SF-GDA is pivotal for privacy-preserving knowledge transfer across graph datasets. Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale."

    "abstract": "Around three quarters of Bitcoin transactions take place off-chain. Despite their significance, the vast majority of the empirical literature on cryptocurrencies focuses on on-chain transactions. This paper presents one of the first analysis of both on- and off-chain demand- and supply-side factors. Two hypotheses relating on-chain and off-chain demand and supply drivers to the Bitcoin price are tested in an ARDL model with daily data from 2019 to 2024. Our estimates document the differential contributions of on-chain and off-chain drivers on the Bitcoin price. Off-chain demand pressures have a significant impact on the Bitcoin price in the long-run. In the short-run, both demand and supply drivers significantly affect the Bitcoin price. Regarding transactions on the blockchain, only on-chain demand pressures are statistically significant - both in the long- and short-run. These findings confirm the dual nature of the Bitcoin price dynamics, where also market fundamentals affect the Bitcoin price in addition to speculative drivers. Bitcoin whale trading has less significant impact on price in the long-run, while is more pronounced contemporaneously and one-period lag."

We show that any $C^2$ function that is both radial and additively separable must be quadratic, establishing a fundamental obstruction for coordinate-wise power-law models. Motivated by this result, we introduce Radial Müntz-Szász Networks (RMN), which represent fields as linear combinations of learnable radial powers $r^μ$, including negative exponents, together with a limit-stable log-primitive for exact $\\log r$ behavior. RMN admits closed-form spatial gradients and Laplacians, enabling physics-informed learning on punctured domains. Across ten 2D and 3D benchmarks, RMN achieves 1.5$\\times$--51$\\times$ lower RMSE than MLPs and 10$\\times$--100$\\times$ lower RMSE than SIREN while using 27 parameters, compared with 33,537 for MLPs and 8,577 for SIREN. We extend RMN to angular dependence (RMN-Angular) and to multiple sources with learnable centers (RMN-MC); when optimization converges, source-center recovery errors fall below $10^{-4}$. We also report controlled failures on smooth, strongly non-radial targets to delineate RMN's operating regime."

Our approach extends naturally to joint regression models where we can have several circular and non-circular responses, and allow us to handle a mix of linear covariates, circular covariates and various random effects. Our formulation aligns naturally with the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), which provides fast and accurate Bayesian inference. We illustrate our approach through several simulated and real examples."

    "abstract": "Spatially structured beams have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing spectrum efficiency (SE) in sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, structured beam schemes based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs) fail to fully exploit the array aperture, thereby limiting their topological reconfigurability and adaptability to diverse communication scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel structured beam communication framework exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to achieve reconfigurable array topologies. Specifically, we develop an MA-based geometric modeling framework to construct a variety of practical array topologies, thereby enabling the realization of diverse array configurations utilizing a unified hardware platform. Furthermore, we investigate the joint design of the array topology and the structured beamforming vector to efficiently exploit the array aperture and facilitate the multiplexing of orthogonal spatial modes. Accordingly, we formulate the corresponding beam generation and demodulation schemes and derive the channel gains under varying array topologies. We also propose an alternating optimization algorithm to jointly optimize the array topology configuration, the antenna element positions, and the structured beamforming vector, with the aim of maximizing the system SE. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint design significantly enhances the SE compared to conventional FPA schemes. By synergizing the spatial multiplexing degrees of freedom (DoFs) of structured beams with the mobility DoFs of MAs within 2D planar regions, this work establishes a reconfigurable and practical framework for structured beam-based wireless communications."

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."

However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies. Finally, we evaluate our method in various social dilemma environments."

We show theoretically that the spin-flip scattering between these edge channels enables a dissipationless spin transport with larger than 100% spin polarization of the charge current. It also allows the transport of spin over macroscopically long distances, even in the absence of an applied charge current."

The nonextensive parameter $q$ enters these quantities primarily through the modification of the Debye mass. Utilizing the derived dielectric functions, we then calculate the collisional energy loss for a heavy quark using two established formalisms: the plasma physics-based Thoma-Gyulassy formula and the thermal field theory-originated Kirzhnits-Thoma formula. Our results show that for both formalisms, the collisional energy loss increases with the nonextensive parameter $q$ with this enhancement being more significant at higher incident quark momenta and suppressed for a heavier quark mass. The energy loss predicted from the Kirzhnits-Thoma formula is substantially larger than that from the Thoma-Gyulassy formula, and the nonextensive effect on the energy loss is more pronounced in the former. Furthermore, the mass suppression of the nonextensive effect on the energy loss is weaker in the Kirzhnits-Thoma approach. These calculations demonstrate that nonextensive statistics can significantly alter the energy loss in the QGP."

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines.

However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \\parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \\parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors. We discuss the similarities between superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and superfluid $^3$He, focusing on their spin-triplet pairing states."

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."

    "abstract": "Network traffic classification is a core primitive for network security and management, yet it is increasingly challenged by pervasive encryption and evolving protocols. A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x."

    "abstract": "Grokking, the phenomenon of delayed generalization, is often attributed to the depth and compositional structure of deep neural networks. We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term."

In particular, challenges that individuals with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF) encounter in video-based learning remain largely underexplored, despite VBL's potential to support their learning through features like self-paced viewing and visual demonstration. To address this gap, we conducted a series of studies with BIF individuals and caretakers to comprehensively understand their VBL challenges. Our analysis revealed challenges stemming from misalignment between user cognitive characteristics and video elements (e.g., overwhelmed by pacing and density, difficulty inferring omitted content), and experiential factors intensifying challenges (e.g., low self-efficacy). While participants employed coping strategies such as repetitive viewing to address these challenges, these strategies could not overcome fundamental gaps with video. We further discuss the design implications on both content and UI-level features for BIF and broader groups with cognitive diversities."

While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

    "abstract": "The crawling motility of many eukaryotic cells is driven by filamentous actin (F-actin), and regulated by a network of signaling proteins and lipids (including small GTPases). The tangle of positive and negative feedback loops gives rise to various experimentally observed dynamic patterns (``actin waves''). Here we consider a recent prototypical model for actin waves in which F-actin exerts negative feedback onto a GTPase. Guided by recent numerical PDE bifurcation analysis in Hughes (2025) and Hughes et al (2026), we explore cell shapes and motility associated with polar, oscillatory, and traveling waves solutions of a mass-conserved partial differential equation (PDE) model. We use Morpheus (cellular Potts) simulations to investigate the implications of such regimes of behavior on the shapes and motion of cells, and on transitions between modes of behavior. The model demonstrates various cell states, including resting (spatially uniform GTPase), polar cells (static ``zones'' of GTPase), and traveling waves along the cell edge. In some parameter regimes, such states can coexist, so that cells can transition from one behavior to another in response to noisy stimuli."

Heterogeneous optically detected spin-acoustic resonance (HODSAR) is an optically detected spin-resonance measurement in which the resonant drive is delivered mechanically by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration. We show that the high-Q multimode response of the SAW resonator enables spectrally selective acoustic addressing of triplet transitions near 105 MHz. Coherent control is evidenced by Rabi oscillations, with a Rabi frequency that increases linearly with the square root of the applied RF input power over the measured drive range, consistent with driven two-level dynamics under acoustic excitation. These results establish spin-acoustic resonance in a heterogeneously integrated molecular thin-film platform and provide a quantitative basis for benchmarking mechanically mediated spin control."

    "abstract": "The solar chromosphere is a region where radiation plays a critical role in energy transfer and interacts strongly with the plasma. In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere. The extension enables the MURaM code to accurately capture chromospheric dynamics."

The cavity may have been created by an ancient supernova. It is hypothesized that the pair of HI features and filamentary HI structure found in its immediate vicinity may be the remnants of a planetary nebula some 3 x 10^5 years old that have cooled to the point that the gas is neutral and emitting the 21-cm spectral line. This remnant has maintained the morphological characteristics of the original planetary nebula because it expanded into a volume of space relatively devoid of interstellar gas that would otherwise have absorbed any traces of the original nebula."

    "abstract": "Flow matching models have recently emerged as an efficient alternative to diffusion, especially for text-guided image generation and editing, offering faster inference through continuous-time dynamics. However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing."

Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

    "abstract": "Text-guided image editing aims to modify specific regions according to the target prompt while preserving the identity of the source image. Recent methods exploit explicit binary masks to constrain editing, but hard mask boundaries introduce artifacts and reduce editability. To address these issues, we propose FusionEdit, a training-free image editing framework that achieves precise and controllable edits. First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results. Second, FusionEdit leverages AdaIN-based modulation within DiT attention layers to perform a statistical attention fusion in the editing region, enhancing editability while preserving global consistency with the source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FusionEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."

    "abstract": "Physics-informed (PI) methodologies have surged to become a pillar route to solve Differential Equations (DEs), sustained by the growth of machine learning methods in scientific contexts. The main proposition of PI is to minimise variationally a loss function, formally ensuring that a neural surrogate of the solution has the DE locally satisfied. The nature of such formulation encouraged the exploration of equivalent quantum algorithms, where the surrogate solution is expressed by variational quantum architectures. The locality of typical loss functions emphasises the DE to hold at an ensemble of points sampled in the domain, but encounters issues when generalising beyond such points, or when propagating boundary conditions. Issues which affect classical and quantum PI algorithms alike. The quest to fill this gap in robustness and accuracy against mainstream DE solvers has led to a plethora of proposals in various directions. In particular, classical DE solvers have long employed the weak form - an integral based approach aiming at imposing a global condition on the solution - prioritising a good average behaviour instead of ``overfitting'' select points. Here, we propose and explore to combine contributions from both local and global loss functions in PI routines, to exploit the advantages and mitigate the weaknesses of both. We showcase this intuition in a variety of problems focusing on differentiable quantum architectures, and demonstrating in particular how orchestrating such hybrid loss formulation with domain decomposition can offer a strong advantage over local-only strategies."
