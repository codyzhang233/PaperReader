    "abstract": "In multivariate longitudinal studies, associations between outcomes often exhibit time-varying and individual level heterogeneity, motivating the modeling of correlations as an explicit function of time and covariates. However, most existing methods for correlation analysis fail to simultaneously capture the time-varying and covariate-dependent effects. We propose a Time-Varying and Covariate-Dependent (TiVAC) correlation model that jointly allows covariate effects on correlation to change flexibly and smoothly across time. TiVAC employs a bivariate Gaussian model where the covariate-dependent correlations are modeled semiparametrically using penalized splines. We develop a penalized maximum likelihood-based Newton-Raphson algorithm, and inference on time-varying effects is provided through simultaneous confidence bands. Simulation studies show that TiVAC consistently outperforms existing methods in accurately estimating correlations across a wide range of settings, including binary and continuous covariates, sparse to dense observation schedules, and across diverse correlation trajectory patterns. We apply TiVAC to a psychiatric case study of 291 bipolar I patients, modeling the time-varying correlation between depression and anxiety scores as a function of their clinical variables. Our analyses reveal significant heterogeneity associated with gender and nervous-system medication use, which varies with age, revealing the complex dynamic relationship between depression and anxiety in bipolar disorders."

    "abstract": "Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum emulation using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and an increased interest in topological Green's function zeros in condensed matter systems, we here study Green's function zeros in topological Floquet systems. We concentrate on interacting Kitaev-like Floquet chains (or equivalently transverse field Ising circuits) and introduce Floquet Green's-function-based topological invariants for the corresponding symmetry class BDI. In the vicinity of special points in the free fermion phase diagram and using tailor-made interactions which lead to the Floquet version of symmetric mass generation, we analytically calculate both edge and bulk Green's functions. Just as in the case of continuum time evolution, topological bands of Green's function zeros may also contribute to the topological invariant. However, contrary to the case of continuum time evolution, Floquet Green's functions can have zeros even in the absence of interactions. Finally, we also discuss an implementation of this Floquet system in a digital quantum emulator: We present a circuit which encodes the interaction under consideration and pinpoint the observables carrying information about the topological Green's function boundary zeros."

We address this gap through a systematic study of data engineering practices for terminal agents, making two key contributions: (1) Terminal-Task-Gen, a lightweight synthetic task generation pipeline that supports seed-based and skill-based task construction, and (2) a comprehensive analysis of data and training strategies, including filtering, curriculum learning, long context training, and scaling behavior. Our pipeline yields Terminal-Corpus, a large-scale open-source dataset for terminal tasks. Using this dataset, we train Nemotron-Terminal, a family of models initialized from Qwen3(8B, 14B, 32B) that achieve substantial gains on Terminal-Bench 2.0: Nemotron-Terminal-8B improves from 2.5% to 13.0% Nemotron-Terminal-14B improves from 4.0% to 20.2%, and Nemotron-Terminal-32B improves from 3.4% to 27.4%, matching the performance of significantly larger models.

    "abstract": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit exceptional 2D visual understanding, their ability to comprehend and reason about 3D space--a cornerstone of spatial intelligence--remains superficial. Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results highlight PSFM as a scalable path toward advancing spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Spa3R."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "The CAP theorem is routinely treated as a systems law: under network partition, a replicated service must sacrifice either consistency or availability. The theorem is correct within its standard asynchronous network model, but operational practice depends on where partition-like phenomena become observable and on how lower layers discard or preserve semantic information about message fate. This paper argues that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) shifts the engineering regime in which CAP tradeoffs become application-visible by (i) replacing fire-and-forget link semantics with bounded-time bilateral reconciliation of endpoint state -- the property we call bisynchrony -- and (ii) avoiding Clos funnel points via an octavalent mesh in which each node can act as the root of a locally repaired spanning tree. The result is not the elimination of hard graph cuts, but a drastic reduction in the frequency and duration of application-visible \"soft partitions\" by detecting and healing dominant fabric faults within hundreds of nanoseconds. We connect this view to Brewer's original CAP framing, the formalization by Gilbert and Lynch, the CAL theorem of Lee et al., which replaces binary partition tolerance with a quantitative measure of apparent latency, and Abadi's PACELC extension."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Recent DESI DR2 BAO measurements, when combined with CMB and SNeIa data, exhibit a $3.2σ$-$3.4σ$ preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) described by the CPL-parametrized equation of state. A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $ρ_{\\rm DE}+p_{\\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\\to-Λ$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong performance in robotic manipulation, but often struggle in long-horizon or out-of-distribution scenarios due to the lack of explicit mechanisms for multimodal reasoning and anticipating how the world will evolve under action. Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning."

    "abstract": "Cosmic rays (CRs) are known to play a key role in many astrophysical environments: they can modify shock dynamics, influence the thermochemistry and the ionization of the interstellar medium, regulate galaxy mass content by driving galactic winds, and be released by jets from active galactic nuclei. They also serve as important observational tracers through $γ$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase."

To address this challenge, we propose Tensor Completion for Defective Arrays (TCDA), a robust algorithm that reformulates the physical imperfection problem as a data recovery task within a virtual tensor space. We present a detailed derivation for constructing an incomplete third-order Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) tensor from the faulty array signals via subarray partitioning, cross-correlation, and dimensional reshaping. Leveraging the tensor's inherent low-rank structure, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS)-based algorithm directly recovers the factor matrices embedding the DOA parameters from the incomplete observations. This approach provides a software-defined 'self-healing' capability, demonstrating exceptional robustness against random element failures without requiring additional processing steps for DOA estimation."

    "abstract": "Selective state space models (SSMs) have rapidly become a compelling backbone for large language models, especially for long-context workloads. Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path. This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead."

To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research."

One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in diagnostic VQA tasks, and more importantly, shows promising potential for prognostic capabilities. These results underscore the value of well-designed, instruction-tuned VLMs in enabling more accurate and clinically meaningful radiological interpretation of longitudinal radiological imaging data."

We propose ReviveMoE, a method for rapid failure recovery in large-scale LLM deployments without restarting the serving instance. ReviveMoE is designed to support both the traditional LLM architecture, which collocates MoE and attention on the same hardware, and the disaggregated architectures, which separate MoE from attention.

At the same time, the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) for inclusive semileptonic decays is known up to and including terms of order $1/m_Q^5$. Therefore, it is desirable to extend the definition of the kinetic mass to higher orders in $1/m_Q$. The original kinetic mass is based on the hadron-mass formula in Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). However, the HQE is formulated in terms of matrix elements defined in full QCD to avoid the appearance of non-local matrix elements. To avoid this, we develop a definition of the kinetic mass rooted in full QCD. Starting from the hadron-mass formula derived from the energy-momentum tensor of full QCD, we define a relation between a general mass and the pole mass. Using a simple cut-off scheme, we compute a generalized kinetic mass at one loop to all powers of $1/m_Q$, which reproduces the well-known results for the kinetic mass up to $1/m_Q^2$. Our approach opens the road to a consistent use of the kinetic mass at higher-orders in the heavy quark expansion."

Our extensions improve performance in multi-class settings with unequal variance-covariance structures and nonlinear class separations by allowing more splits and more flexible class groupings in the projection pursuit computation. Proposing algorithmic improvements is straightforward; demonstrating their actual utility is not. We therefore develop two visual diagnostic approaches to verify that the enhancements perform as intended. Using high-dimensional visualization techniques, we examine model fits on benchmark datasets to assess whether the algorithm behaves as theorized. An interactive web application enables users to explore the behavior of both the original and enhanced classifiers under controlled scenarios.

In this work, we use a benchmark radar dataset to reimplement and assess three recent denoising and preprocessing techniques: adaptive preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and entropy-based denoising. To illustrate the shortcomings of conventional metrics in low-SNR regimes, we evaluate performance using both perceptual image quality measures and standard error-based metrics. We additionally propose a novel framework for static activity recognition using range-angle feature maps to expand HAR beyond dynamic activities. We present two important contributions: a temporal tracking algorithm to enforce consistency and a no-reference quality scoring algorithm to assess RA-map fidelity.

In this study, we investigated the surface reactions of solid CS$_2$ with hydrogen (H) atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) using laboratory experiments supported by computational calculations. Our results show that CS$_2$ reacts with H atoms through quantum tunneling in the initial step, followed by successive H addition reactions, with or without activation barriers, on icy surfaces. These processes lead to the formation of several sulfur-bearing species, including hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S), methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH), and small amounts of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) and methanedithiol (CH$_2$(SH)$_2$). The observed reactivity of CS$_2$ with H atoms provides a plausible explanation for the non-detection of CS$_2$ in interstellar ices. Furthermore, the efficient hydrogenation of the complex molecules derived from CS$_2$, namely HC(S)SH and CH$_2$(SH)$_2$, suggests that these species could be easily undergone with H atoms to produce other S-bearing species under ISM conditions."

The key new input is an inequality relating the knot Floer homology of a generalized satellite knot with that of its companion, proved via the immersed curves formulation of bordered Heegaard Floer homology, which should be of independent interest. Our work, together with results of Kojima--McShane, also leads to an explicit upper bound on the Gromov norm of the complement of any fibered predecessor of a knot $K \\subset S^3$, in terms of the arc index and genus of $K$."

By exploiting the structure of the constraints, we show that both a priori and a posteriori distribution-free probabilistic robustness certificates for a possibly sub-optimal solution to the resulting data-driven optimization problem can be obtained with minimal computational effort. Building on these results, we also discuss a one-shot and an incremental procedure to determine the size of the data-set so as to guarantee a user-chosen robustness level. Notably, both the a posteriori robustness assessment and incremental data-set sizing do not require to solve the non-convex scenario program. A comparative analysis performed on the unit commitment problem using real data reveals a limited increase in conservativeness with a significant computational saving with respect to the application of scenario theory results for general, non necessarily structured, non-convex problems."

    "abstract": "While reasoning models are increasingly ubiquitous, the effects of reasoning training on a model's internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce transcoder adapters, a technique for learning an interpretable approximation of the difference in MLP computation before and after fine-tuning. We apply transcoder adapters to characterize the differences between Qwen2.5-Math-7B and its reasoning-distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. Learned adapters are faithful to the target model's internal computation and next-token predictions. When evaluated on reasoning benchmarks, adapters match the reasoning model's response lengths and typically recover 50-90% of the accuracy gains from reasoning fine-tuning. Adapter features are sparsely activating and interpretable. When examining adapter features, we find that only ~8% have activating examples directly related to reasoning behaviors. We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens (e.g., \"wait\"). Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only ~2.4% of adapter features (5.6k total) performing one of two functions. These features are necessary and sufficient for producing hesitation tokens; removing them reduces response length, often without affecting accuracy. Overall, our results provide insight into reasoning training and suggest transcoder adapters may be useful for studying fine-tuning more broadly."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new model for ML-augmented online decision making, called online algorithms with unreliable guidance (OAG). This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$. We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art."

We argue that this understanding hinges on two complementary capacities: geometric perception, which identifies the structural parts of objects that enable interaction, and interaction perception, which models how an agent's actions engage with those parts. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a systematic probing of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We find that models like DINO inherently encode part-level geometric structures, while generative models like Flux contain rich, verb-conditioned spatial attention maps that serve as implicit interaction priors. Crucially, we demonstrate that these two dimensions are not merely correlated but are composable elements of affordance. By simply fusing DINO's geometric prototypes with Flux's interaction maps in a training-free and zero-shot manner, we achieve affordance estimation competitive with weakly-supervised methods. This final fusion experiment confirms that geometric and interaction perception are the fundamental building blocks of affordance understanding in VFMs, providing a mechanistic account of how perception grounds action."

Within a microscopic Bogoliubov de Gennes scattering formalism, we compute angle and energy resolved conductance, spin polarization, zero bias response, and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for nodal $p_x$ and chiral $p_x+ip_y$ superconductors. Although altermagnets carry no net magnetization, the momentum dependent spin splitting, combined with RSOC, enables a pronounced spin valve effect without ferromagnetic electrodes. We show that conductance, spin polarization, and TMR exhibit distinct and robust fingerprints of the triplet pairing symmetry. For nodal $p_x$ superconductor, sign change induced surface Andreev bound states dominate subgap transport, producing strongly anisotropic conductance, giant zero bias spin polarization, and a monotonic enhancement of TMR with increasing RSOC. In contrast, the chiral $p_x+ip_y$ state exhibits smoother conductance and polarization profiles governed by topological edge modes, resulting in broader, lobe like TMR patterns with weaker sensitivity to interface transparency. Moreover, RSOC can acts as an electrically tunable spin-mixing knob, while the barrier strength controls coherence and energy selectivity, together enabling large, symmetry controlled spin filtering and magnetoresistance. Our results establish AM/TSC/AM junctions as a symmetry sensitive transport platform for realizing electrically tunable spin valve functionality and probing triplet pairing without ferromagnetic components."

Our approach is based on a private blockchain, wherein smart contracts are deployed to enforce control exclusively by patients. By granting patients exclusive control over their EHRs, our solution ensures compliance with personal data protection laws and empowers individuals to manage their health information autonomously. Notably, our proposed architecture seamlessly integrates with existing health provider information systems, facilitating interoperability and effectively addressing security and data heterogeneity challenges. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a prototype based on a private implementation of the Hyperledger platform, enabling the simulation of diverse scenarios involving access control and health data sharing among healthcare practitioners. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability of our solution, thereby substantiating its efficacy and robustness in real-world healthcare settings."

However, this paper observes that the mainstream clause reduction heuristic in modern SAT solvers becomes ineffective in the critical domain of complex arithmetic circuit verification, such as multipliers. On these instances, the dominant Literal Block Distance (LBD) metric for measuring clause quality degrades into a simple value of clause length, without any perception of dynamic clause usage during solving.To address this issue, a novel clause reduction mechanism is proposed, which is entirely independent of LBD. Its core idea is to decouple and handle separately the two most fundamental characteristics of learnt clauses--inherent lineage and dynamic usage patterns--thereby avoiding the efficiency degradation caused by inappropriately mixing these properties. Experiments show that our method consistently improves mainstream solvers and achieves speedups of up to 5.74x on complex arithmetic circuit problems, while maintaining comparable performance on general-purpose benchmarks. These results challenge the prevailing LBD-centric clause quality metric for clause management."

We infer a continuous opinion distribution by applying a model based on retweet interactions, previously detecting elite users with fixed and antagonist opinions. The resulting distribution presents a mainly bimodal behavior with an intermediate third pole that shows a less polarized society with the presence of not only antagonist opinions. We find that the more active, engaged and influential users hold more extreme positions. Also we prove that there is a clear relationship between political positions and the use of language, showing that against independence users speak mainly Spanish while pro-independence users speak Catalan and Spanish almost indistinctly.

Traditional KL divergence tends to be dominated by the next tokens with the highest probabilities, i.e., the teacher's modes, thereby diminishing the influence of less probable yet potentially informative components of the output distribution. We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our modified distillation method yields competitive performance in both pre-training and supervised distillation of decoder models across various datasets. Furthermore, the distillation process is efficient and can be performed with a modest academic budget for large datasets, eliminating the need for industry-scale computing."

We introduce an alignment benchmark spanning 904 scenarios across six categories -- Honesty, Safety, Non-Manipulation, Robustness, Corrigibility, and Scheming -- validated as realistic by human raters. Our scenarios place models under conflicting instructions, simulated tool access, and multi-turn escalation to reveal behavioural tendencies that single-turn evaluations miss. Evaluating 24 frontier models using LLM judges validated against human annotations, we find that even top-performing models exhibit gaps in specific categories, while the majority of models show consistent weaknesses across the board. Factor analysis reveals that alignment behaves as a unified construct (analogous to the g-factor in cognitive research) with models scoring high on one category tending to score high on others. We publicly release the benchmark and an interactive leaderboard to support ongoing evaluation, with plans to expand scenarios in areas where we observe persistent weaknesses and to add new models as they are released."

We examine the coupling between the photosphere and the chromosphere, studying the polarimetric signals during a period that encompasses the decaying phase of a C-class flare and the appearance of a new C-class flare at the same location. We focus on the analysis of various spectral lines. In particular, we study the Si I 10827 Å, Ca I 10833.4 Å, Na I 10834.9 Å, and Ca I 10838.9 Å photospheric lines, as well as the He I 10830 Å triplet. GRIS data revealed the presence of flare-related red- and blueshifted spectral line components, reaching Doppler velocities up to 90 km/s, and complex Si I profiles where the He i spectral line contribution is blueshifted. In contrast, the photospheric Ca i and Na i transitions remained unchanged, indicating that the flare did not modify the physical conditions of the lower photosphere. We combined that information with simultaneous imaging in the Ca ii H line and TiO band with the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+), finding that the flare emission did not affect the inverse granulation or nearby plage, in agreement with the results from GRIS. We also complement the previous studies with a forward modelling computation, concluding that the He I spectral line emission reflects a complex response of the flaring chromosphere. Radiative excitation from coronal EUV irradiation, energy deposition by flare-accelerated electrons, and dynamic field-aligned plasma flows likely act together to produce the observed supersonic downflows and upflows. We plan to expand these findings through inversions of the He I 10830 Å triplet signals in the future."

DDs are directed acyclic layered graphs; restricted DDs are a generalized greedy heuristic for finding feasible solutions, and relaxed DDs compute combinatorial relaxed bounds. There is substantial theory that leverages DD-based bounding, yet the complexity of constructing the DDs themselves has received little attention. Standard restricted DD construction requires $O(w \\log(w))$ per layer; standard relaxed DD construction requires $O(w^2)$, where $w$ is the width of the DD. Increasing $w$ improves bound quality at the cost of more time and memory. We introduce implicit Decision Diagrams, storing arcs implicitly rather than explicitly, and reducing per-layer complexity to $O(w)$ for restricted and relaxed DDs. We prove this is optimal: any framework treating state-update and merge operations as black boxes cannot do better. Optimal complexity shifts the challenge from algorithmic overhead to low-level engineering. We show how implicit DDs can drive a MIP solver, and release ImplicitDDs.jl, an open-source Julia solver exploiting the implementation refinements our theory enables.

    "abstract": "Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution, offering the potential to handle visual tasks in challenging scenarios. However, due to the sparse information content in individual events, directly processing the raw event data to solve vision tasks is highly inefficient, which severely limits the applicability of state-of-the-art methods in real-time tasks, such as motion segmentation, a fundamental task for dynamic scene understanding. Incorporating normal flow as an intermediate representation to compress motion information from event clusters within a localized region provides a more effective solution. In this work, we propose a normal flow-based motion segmentation framework for event-based vision. Leveraging the dense normal flow directly learned from event neighborhoods as input, we formulate the motion segmentation task as an energy minimization problem solved via graph cuts, and optimize it iteratively with normal flow clustering and motion model fitting. By using a normal flow-based motion model initialization and fitting method, the proposed system is able to efficiently estimate the motion models of independently moving objects with only a limited number of candidate models, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and ensures real-time performance, achieving nearly a 800x speedup in comparison to the open-source state-of-the-art method. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets fully demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our framework."

However, viscoelasticity and temperature-dependent stiffness of the photopolymer lead to hysteresis and drift, which significantly degrade open-loop position accuracy and long-term stability in quasi-static operation. Therefore, closed-loop control with integrated displacement sensing is essential for 3D nano-printed optical microsystems in practical precision positioning applications. Here, we present a closed-loop control system for a such a lens actuator that uses a commercial 3-axis Hall sensor for position tracking. A NdFeB micromagnet encircling the integrated microlens provides both the actuation force and a position-dependent sensing signal. The Hall sensor, located between an anti-Helmholtz-like coil pair that drives the scanner bidirectionally, measures the combined field due to the micro-magnet and the coil pair. Calibration-based subtraction separates the coil field and sensor offset contributions to recover the magnet field and thus the axial magnet displacement. Closed-loop operation yields a mean absolute accuracy of 0.86 um and a precision of 0.49 um over a displacement range of 150 um while eliminating viscoelastic creep, suppressing hysteresis, and minimizing temperature-induced displacement drift under coil self-heating. This sensing approach requires no additional microfabrication steps and provides a practical path toward stable and repeatable positioning for monolithically 3D nano-printed optical microsystems."

All-dielectric platforms based on distributions of T-shaped unit cells are employed for this purpose. The unit cell design is based on a circuital approach and analytical formulations, where phase shifts necessary for OAM generation are achieved by varying the dielectric-to-air ratio within the structure. Based on this unit cell, a set of transmitarrays (TAs) are designed to produce specific OAM modes. These TAs are fabricated in-house using stereolithographic 3D printing and experimentally tested. The tests evaluate two key features of OAM beams: the orthogonality of distinct vortex modes, as characterized by their electric field distributions, and their object-avoidance capability, enabled by the central null characteristic of the wavefront. In addition, a field-test within an indoor environment is conducted emulating a real wireless system. A bit error rate lower than 10\\textsuperscript{$-$6} is observed for solidary modes in Tx and Rx, whereas orthogonal modes produces an increment in 4 order of magnitude. The obtained results reveals that the prototype is suitable for short-range scenarios, enabling techniques such as OAM-multiplexation or physical-layer security thanks to the effective orthogonality beteween modes."

However, the requirement of a dedicated reflection surface for the open-path laser makes automating the spatial sampling process challenging. This publication presents a robotic system for collecting open-path measurements, making use of a sensor mounted on a ground-based pan-tilt unit and a small drone carrying a reflector. By means of a zoom camera, the ground unit visually tracks red LED markers mounted on the drone and aligns the sensor's laser beam with the reflector.

Outdoor experiments validated the system's performance, demonstrating successful autonomous tracking and valid CO2 measurements at distances up to 60 meters.

Here, the Hodge vector of a lattice polytope is its local $h^*$-vector with leading and trailing zeroes removed. This result allows finding infinitely many high-dimensional lattice polytopes with the same Hodge vector that are not free joins. The proof relies on a closed formula for the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of generic complete intersections in the torus in terms of the bivariate/mixed $h^*$-polynomial. A special case of our construction is what we call Lawrence twists: extending the Gale transform by centrally-symmetric pairs of vectors.

    "abstract": "The Unix command \\texttt{find} is among the first commands taught to beginners, yet remains indispensable for experienced engineers. In this paper, we demonstrate that \\texttt{find} possesses unexpected computational power, establishing three Turing completeness results using the GNU implementation (a standard in Linux distributions). (1) \\texttt{find} + \\texttt{mkdir} (a system that has only \\texttt{find} and \\texttt{mkdir}) is Turing complete: by encoding computational states as directory paths and using regex back-references to copy substrings, we simulate 2-tag systems. (2) GNU \\texttt{find} 4.9.0+ alone is Turing complete: by reading and writing to files during traversal, we simulate a two-counter machine without \\texttt{mkdir}. (3) \\texttt{find} + \\texttt{mkdir} without regex back-references is still Turing complete: by a trick of encoding regex patterns directly into directory names, we achieve the same power. These results place \\texttt{find} among the ``surprisingly Turing-complete'' systems, highlighting the hidden complexity within seemingly simple standard utilities."

    "abstract": "Chew, Goldberger & Low (CGL) equations are a set of hyperbolic PDEs with non-conservative products used to model the plasma flows, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not valid, and the pressure tensor is assumed to be rotated by the magnetic field. This results in the pressure tensor, which is described by the two scalar components. As the magnetic field also evolves, controlling the divergence of the magnetic field is important. In this work, we consider the generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique for the CGL model. The resulting model is referred to as the GLM-CGL system. To make the system suitable for entropy-stable schemes, we reformulate the GLM-CGL system by treating some conservative terms as non-conservative. The resulting system has a non-conservative part that does not affect entropy evolution. We then propose entropy stable numerical methods for the GLM-CGL model. The numerical results for the GLM-CGL system are then compared with the CGL system without the GLM divergence diminishing approach to demonstrate that the GLM approach indeed leads to significant improvement in the magnetic field divergence diminishing."

In FeSe, symmetry-breaking perturbations serve as highly sensitive probes of these couplings. Previous work has shown that defects and isoelectronic substitution can substantially alter these interactions, giving rise to additional phonon modes. In this study, uniaxial strain is employed as a tunable symmetry-breaking control parameter to probe the intrinsic lattice response in the absence of disorder. The temperature evolution of phonon excitations was examined with fine temperature resolution in the vicinity of the nemato-structural transition temperature $T_s$, under strain applied along the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions. A subtle asymmetry of the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode appears in the unstrained crystal within a narrow temperature window around $T_s$, originating from the emergence of an additional mode in the fully symmetric channel. With applied strain, this feature becomes more distinctly resolved. The anomaly is attributed to modifications of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom driven by the ordering fluctuations right above the nematic transition. These fluctuations enhance susceptibility for phonon-electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of the X and R points of the Brillouin zone and promote two-phonon scattering close to the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode. The presence of this two-phonon scattering depends on both the strength and the direction of the applied strain, indicating a high sensitivity of FeSe to local symmetry breaking."

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant global health burden and are a leading cause of disability worldwide. While MRI is essential for accurate diagnosis, its interpretation remains exceptionally challenging. Radiologists must identify multiple potential abnormalities within complex anatomical structures across different imaging planes, a process that requires significant expertise and is prone to variability. We developed OrthoDiffusion, a unified diffusion-based foundation model designed for multi-task musculoskeletal MRI interpretation. The framework utilizes three orientation-specific 3D diffusion models, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on 15,948 unlabeled knee MRI scans, to learn robust anatomical features from sagittal, coronal, and axial views. These view-specific representations are integrated to support diverse clinical tasks, including anatomical segmentation and multi-label diagnosis. Our evaluation demonstrates that OrthoDiffusion achieves excellent performance in the segmentation of 11 knee structures and the detection of 8 knee abnormalities. The model exhibited remarkable robustness across different clinical centers and MRI field strengths, consistently outperforming traditional supervised models. Notably, in settings where labeled data was scarce, OrthoDiffusion maintained high diagnostic precision using only 10\\% of training labels. Furthermore, the anatomical representations learned from knee imaging proved highly transferable to other joints, achieving strong diagnostic performance across 11 diseases of the ankle and shoulder. These findings suggest that diffusion-based foundation models can serve as a unified platform for multi-disease diagnosis and anatomical segmentation, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of musculoskeletal MRI interpretation in real-world clinical workflows."

We introduce adaptive text anonymization, a new task formulation in which anonymization strategies are automatically adapted to specific privacy-utility requirements. We propose a framework for task-specific prompt optimization that automatically constructs anonymization instructions for language models, enabling adaptation to different privacy goals, domains, and downstream usage patterns. To evaluate our approach, we present a benchmark spanning five datasets with diverse domains, privacy constraints, and utility objectives. Across all evaluated settings, our framework consistently achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off than existing baselines, while remaining computationally efficient and effective on open-source language models, with performance comparable to larger closed-source models. Additionally, we show that our method can discover novel anonymization strategies that explore different points along the privacy-utility trade-off frontier."

Conventional TI schemes start from an NVT harmonic reference and require three successive corrections to recover the Gibbs free energy of the real crystal in the NPT ensemble. However, the NVT-to-NPT correction neglects full cell flexibility. Here, we present a rigorous (and only) two-step TI scheme that operates entirely in the NPT ensemble, eliminating the need for the approximate NVT-to-NPT step. The key methodological advancement is the novel NPT reference that explicitly accounts for full cell fluctuations. The new approach is compared with the conventional one via two complementary case studies. For ice polymorphs, having simple cell-shape distributions, the new approach reproduces conventional TI results with excellent agreement. For CsPbI3, whose black phase exhibits complex cell-shape behavior, we demonstrate that our novel method provides more accurate Gibbs free energy differences than the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed framework maintains comparable computational cost while offering a simplified workflow. Overall, the new NPT TI scheme provides rigorous and direct Gibbs free energy calculations for solids."

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CHESS surpasses Full-KV quality using only \\textbf{1\\%} of the KV cache, delivers low-latency stable inference with up to \\textbf{4.56$\\times$} higher throughput, and consistently outperforms other strong baselines.

    "abstract": "Reward design has been one of the central challenges for real world reinforcement learning (RL) deployment, especially in settings with multiple objectives. Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems. We show that multi-objective RLAIF can produce policies that yield balanced trade-offs reflecting different user priorities without laborious reward engineering. We argue that integrating RLAIF into multi-objective RL offers a scalable path toward user-aligned policy learning in domains with inherently conflicting objectives."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential for generalist robotic policies; however, they struggle to generalize to long-horizon complex tasks in novel real-world domains due to distribution shifts and the scarcity of high-quality demonstrations. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for policy improvement, applying it to real-world VLA fine-tuning faces challenges regarding exploration efficiency, training stability, and sample cost. To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models. Firstly, to facilitate effective policy optimization, we introduce Interaction-Guided Advantage Weighted Regression (IG-AWR), an RL algorithm that dynamically modulates exploration intensity based on the robot's interaction status. Furthermore, to address the limitations of sparse or task-specific rewards, we design a novel hybrid dense reward function that integrates the trajectory-level reward and the subtask-level reward. Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%). Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of IG-AWR and hybrid reward shaping. In summary, our work establishes and validates a novel reinforced fine-tuning system for VLA models in real-world robotic manipulation."

The prediction performance improves as higher-level approximate and detail signals are incrementally added. The Combination 6 method integrating F10.7 with its first to fifth level approximate and detail signals outperforms methods using only approximate or detail signals. (2) Incorporating ISN and its wavelet-decomposed signals does not enhance prediction performance. (3) The Combination 6 method significantly surpasses S. Yan et al.

Using finite element simulations, we demonstrate that this configuration - without requiring surface structuration - gives rise to frequency ranges bounded in k-space and characterized by strong SAW attenuation, which we term adhesion-induced resonant attenuation zones. We show that these attenuation zones closely mimic the resonant behavior typically observed in locally resonant metamaterials and can be understood through a mass-spring analogy, where the adhesion between the layer and substrate governs the frequency and width of the attenuation zones. As a practical demonstration, we propose a bilayer configuration as a practical route to experimentally realize adhesion-induced resonant attenuation of SAWs, where a soft and thin interfacial film serves as an intermediate adhesive bonding between the layer and substrate, providing a realistic and tunable interfacial stiffness. Our findings offer a simplified route to achieving SAW manipulation through continuous layered media with tunable adhesion, providing a practical alternative to complex structural designs in SAW-based devices across a broad frequency range."

We highlight through analytical and numerical arguments that the chaotic rather than regular nature of the trajectory is determined by the details of the scattering with the boundary, and interpret these results in terms of parametric resonance theory, and specifically the Mathieu equation."

In our prior work PRECTR, we proposed a unified framework to integrate these two subtasks,thereby eliminating their inconsistency and leading to mutual benefit.However, our previous work still faces three main challenges. First, low-active users and new users have limited search behavioral data, making it difficult to achieve effective personalized relevance preference modeling. Second, training data for ranking models predominantly come from high-relevance exposures, creating a distribution mismatch with the broader candidate space in coarse-ranking, leading to generalization bias. Third, due to the latency constraint, the original model employs an Emb+MLP architecture with a frozen BERT encoder, which prevents joint optimization and creates misalignment between representation learning and CTR fine-tuning. To solve these issues, we further reinforce our method and propose PRECTR-V2. Specifically, we mitigate the low-activity users' sparse behavior problem by mining global relevance preferences under the specific query, which facilitates effective personalized relevance modeling for cold-start scenarios. Subsequently, we construct hard negative samples through embedding noise injection and relevance label reconstruction, and optimize their relative ranking against positive samples via pairwise loss, thereby correcting exposure bias. Finally, we pretrain a lightweight transformer-based encoder via knowledge distillation from LLM and SFT on the text relevance classification task. This encoder replaces the frozen BERT module, enabling better adaptation to CTR fine-tuning and advancing beyond the traditional Emb+MLP paradigm."

The formulation accounts for microstructural effects by introducing an independent micro-distortion tensor field in addition to the classical displacement field. Under the assumptions of axisymmetric deformation and plane strain conditions, the governing equilibrium equations reduce to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations in the radial coordinate. By introducing suitable auxiliary variables, the system is reformulated into a non-homogeneous modified Bessel equation, which admits an exact analytical solution. Explicit expressions are derived for the radial displacement field and the non-zero components of the micro-distortion tensor. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the influence of material parameters and the characteristic length on the displacement. The results demonstrate that the relaxed micromorphic model predicts deviations from classical elasticity where microstructural effects are more pronounced. The obtained solution provides valuable physical insight into the mechanics of cylindrical shells and serves as a benchmark for validating numerical implementations of relaxed micromorphic models."

In this work, we introduce BBQ, a large-scale text-to-image model that directly conditions on numeric bounding boxes and RGB triplets within a unified structured-text framework. We obtain precise spatial and chromatic control by training on captions enriched with parametric annotations, without architectural modifications or inference-time optimization. This also enables intuitive user interfaces such as object dragging and color pickers, replacing ambiguous iterative prompting with precise, familiar controls. Across comprehensive evaluations, BBQ achieves strong box alignment and improves RGB color fidelity over state-of-the-art baselines.

The results highlight the feasibility of privacy-aware demand forecasting and outline the trade-offs between FL and CML approaches."

    "abstract": "We introduce a system architecture that addresses a fundamental challenge in deploying language-model agents for autonomous control of scientific instrumentation: ensuring reliability in safety-critical environments. The framework integrates probabilistic reasoning by domain-specialized language models with deterministic execution layers that enforce constraints through structured validation and modular orchestration. By separating intent interpretation, experimental planning, and command verification, the architecture translates high-level scientific goals into verifiable experimental actions. We demonstrate this approach in real-time atomic-resolution scanning probe microscopy experiments operated at room temperature, where the system autonomously generates control strategies, invokes corrective modules, and maintains stable operation under experimentally challenging conditions. Quantitative evaluations show that domain-adapted small language models achieve high routing robustness and command accuracy while operating on consumer-grade hardware. Beyond a specific instrument, the framework establishes a general computational principle for deploying language-model agents in safety-critical experimental workflows, providing a pathway toward scalable autonomous laboratories."

This optimization problem often appears as a key sub-problem of distributionally robust optimization problems. We establish the asymptotic convergence of a hierarchy of semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations, providing a framework for approximating the optimal values of these inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problems. A central foundational contribution is the development of a new lifted positivity certificate: we demonstrate that piecewise polynomials positive over Archimedean basic semi-algebraic sets admit a structured system of sum-of-squares (SOS) representations. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed hierarchy achieves finite convergence under suitable conditions when the defining polynomials are convex. The practical utility and versatility of this approach are demonstrated via numerical experiments in revenue estimation and portfolio optimization."

In this paper, we focus on a bilayer system in which the two layers undergo independent but incompatible growth. We examine how the strength of the growth patterns and the aspect ratio of the bilayer influence the resulting shapes. We first investigate the effect of global area difference in the bilayer. Next, we make one of the two layers active and program it with positive or negative, localized or uniform curvature. We then present examples involving competition between two active surfaces with opposite curvature signs or different curvature distributions and understand how the final configurations follow from the principles identified earlier. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to program biologically inspired shapes, such as dental epithelium and the ventral furrow in Drosophila, using a bilayer with simple, distinct deformation gradients."

For pre-trained models, however, this can result in inefficient, overly conservative set sizes when not calibrated towards the target task. We propose DANCE, a doubly locally adaptive nearest-neighbor based conformal algorithm combining two novel nonconformity scores directly using the data's embedded representation. DANCE first fits a task-adaptive kernel regression model from the embedding layer before using the learned kernel space to produce the final prediction sets for uncertainty quantification. We test against state-of-the-art local, task-adapted and zero-shot conformal baselines, demonstrating DANCE's superior blend of set size efficiency and robustness across various datasets."

However, current methods cannot effectively translate this multimodal data into precise, executable simulation scenarios, hindering the scalability of ADS safety validation. In this work, we propose a scalable and verifiable pipeline that uses a large language model (GPT-4o mini) and a probabilistic intermediate representation (an Extended Scenic domain-specific language) to automatically extract semantic scenario configurations from crash reports and generate corresponding simulation-ready scenarios. Unlike earlier approaches such as ScenicNL and LCTGen (which generate scenarios directly from text) or TARGET (which uses deterministic mappings from traffic rules), our method introduces an intermediate Scenic DSL layer to separate high-level semantic understanding from low-level scenario rendering, reducing errors and capturing real-world variability. We evaluated the pipeline on cases from the NHTSA CIREN database. The results show high accuracy in knowledge extraction: 100% correctness for environmental and road network attributes, and 97% and 98% for oracle and actor trajectories, respectively, compared to human-derived ground truth. We executed the generated scenarios in the CARLA simulator using the Autoware driving stack, and they consistently triggered the intended traffic-rule violations (such as opposite-lane crossing and red-light running) across 2,000 scenario variations. These findings demonstrate that the proposed pipeline provides a legally grounded, scalable, and verifiable approach to ADS safety validation."

We demonstrate that standard \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" protocols suffer from a systematic Alignment Gap when applied to upper-undergraduate to early graduate level mathematics. To quantify this, we introduce QEDBench, the first large-scale dual-rubric alignment benchmark to systematically measure alignment with human experts on university-level math proofs by contrasting course-specific rubrics against expert common knowledge criteria. By deploying a dual-evaluation matrix (7 judges x 5 solvers) against 1,000+ hours of human evaluation, we reveal that certain frontier evaluators like Claude Opus 4.5, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Llama 4 Maverick exhibit significant positive bias (up to +0.18, +0.20, +0.30, +0.36 mean score inflation, respectively). Furthermore, we uncover a critical reasoning gap in the discrete domain: while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.91 average human evaluation score), other reasoning models like GPT-5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 see their performance significantly degrade in discrete domains. Specifically, their average human evaluation scores drop to 0.72 and 0.63 in Discrete Math, and to 0.74 and 0.50 in Graph Theory. In addition to these research results, we also release QEDBench as a public benchmark for evaluating and improving AI judges.

Untrusted monitoring -- using one untrusted model to oversee another -- is one approach to reducing risk. Justifying the safety of an untrusted monitoring deployment is challenging because developers cannot safely deploy a misaligned model to test their protocol directly. In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies. We create a safety case sketch to clearly present our argument, explicitly state our assumptions, and highlight unsolved challenges. We identify conditions under which passive self-recognition could be a more effective collusion strategy than those studied previously. Our work builds towards more robust evaluations of untrusted monitoring."

An approach exploiting the CERN White Rabbit protocol, deployed and enhanced on an electronic system capable of generating arbitrary frequencies with Hertz precision, is proposed here. Results of performance tests for the synchronization of a laser system, typically employed as a diagnostic for electron/positron beam polarimetry in accelerators, are provided in this Paper. We demonstrate that without implementing corrections for environmental changes, as temperature drifts, the system can synchronize a pulsed laser with picoseconds precision over a hundred kilometers, exhibiting drifts of a few picoseconds. This work paves the way for a low-cost implementation of picosecond synchronization of accelerator components and large-scale detectors."

    "abstract": "A fine-grained understanding of egocentric human-environment interactions is crucial for developing next-generation embodied agents. One fundamental challenge in this area involves accurately parsing hands and active objects. While transformer-based architectures have demonstrated considerable potential for such tasks, several key limitations remain unaddressed: 1) existing query initialization mechanisms rely primarily on semantic cues or learnable parameters, demonstrating limited adaptability to changing active objects across varying input scenes; 2) previous transformer-based methods utilize pixel-level semantic features to iteratively refine queries during mask generation, which may introduce interaction-irrelevant content into the final embeddings; and 3) prevailing models are susceptible to \"interaction illusion\", producing physically inconsistent predictions. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Interaction-aware Transformer (InterFormer), which integrates three key components, i.e., a Dynamic Query Generator (DQG), a Dual-context Feature Selector (DFS), and the Conditional Co-occurrence (CoCo) loss. The DQG explicitly grounds query initialization in the spatial dynamics of hand-object contact, enabling targeted generation of interaction-aware queries for hands and various active objects. The DFS fuses coarse interactive cues with semantic features, thereby suppressing interaction-irrelevant noise and emphasizing the learning of interactive relationships. The CoCo loss incorporates hand-object relationship constraints to enhance physical consistency in prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the EgoHOS and the challenging out-of-distribution mini-HOI4D datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization ability.

Prior studies identified these attack surfaces yet focused on expanding attack vectors rather than optimizing attack performance, reporting impractically high attack costs that underestimate the true privacy risk. We propose OptiLeak, a reinforcement learning-enhanced framework that maximizes prompt reconstruction efficiency through two-stage fine-tuning. Our key insight is that domain-specific ``hard tokens'' -- terms difficult to predict yet carrying sensitive information -- can be automatically identified via likelihood ranking and used to construct preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization, eliminating manual annotation. This enables effective preference alignment while avoiding the overfitting issues of extended supervised fine-tuning. Evaluated on three benchmarks spanning medical and financial domains, OptiLeak achieves up to $12.48\\times$ reduction in average requests per token compared to baseline approaches, with consistent improvements across model scales from 3B to 14B parameters. Our findings demonstrate that cache-based prompt leakage poses a more severe threat than previously reported, underscoring the need for robust cache isolation in production deployments."

    "abstract": "As a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm, vertical federated learning (VFL) allows multiple passive parties with distinct features and one active party with labels to collaboratively train a model. Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness. We hope that the disclosure of this triggerless backdoor attack pathway will encourage the community to revisit security threats in VFL scenarios and inspire researchers to develop more robust and practical defense strategies."

In this work, we focus on three versions of the Feedback-based Algorithm, a protocol that eliminates classical optimization loops via measurement feedback. We analyze long-read DNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and human mitochondrial DNA using standard FALQON, second-order FALQON (SO-FALQON), and time-rescaled FALQON (TR-FALQON). Numerical results show that both variants improve convergence to the ground state and increase success probabilities at reduced circuit depths.

    "abstract": "The performance of a given quantum error correction (QEC) code depends upon the noise model that is assumed. Independent Pauli noise, applied after each quantum operation, is a simplistic noise model that is easy to simulate and understand in the context of stabilizer codes. Although such a noise model is artificial, it is equivalent to independent, random, unbiased qubit rotations. What about spatially or temporally correlated qubit rotations? Such a noise model is applicable to global operations (e.g., NMR or ESR), common control sources (e.g., lasers), or slow drift (e.g., charge or magnetic noise) in various qubit technologies. In the worst case, such errors can combine constructively and result in a post-correction failure rate that increases with the number of error correction cycles. However, we show that this worst case does not generally arise unless taking active corrective actions while performing QEC. That is, by employing virtual Pauli frame updates (\"passive\" error correction) rather than physical corrections (\"active\" error correction), coherent errors do not compound appreciably. Starting in a random Pauli frame is also advantageous. In fact, through perturbation theory arguments and supporting numerical simulations, we show that the logical qubit performance beyond distance 3 for correlated single-qubit Hamiltonian noise models (i.e., global errant qubit rotations), when employing these \"lazy\" strategies, essentially matches the performance of Pauli noise model with the same process fidelity (fidelity after one application). In a more general circuit model of noise, correlations may add constructively within syndrome extraction rounds but Pauli frame randomization from passive error correction mitigates this effect across multiple rounds."

We developed and validated a schema for evaluating LLM errors in scholarly question-answering systems that reflects the assessment strategies of practicing scientists. In collaboration with domain experts, we identified 20 error patterns across seven categories through thematic analysis of 68 question-answer pairs. We validated this schema through contextual inquiries with 10 additional scientists, which showed not only which errors experts naturally identify but also how structured evaluation schemas can help them detect previously overlooked issues. Domain experts use systematic assessment strategies, including technical precision testing, value-based evaluation, and meta-evaluation of their own practices. We discuss implications for supporting expert evaluation of LLM outputs, including opportunities for personalized, schema-driven tools that adapt to individual evaluation patterns and expertise levels."

    "abstract": "We prove that massless scalar three-point amplitudes are self-dual under Fourier transformation. This implies that the momentum space amplitude can be expressed as the position space amplitude of the same graph with transformed edge-weights (not the dual graph) if external vertices are labeled accordingly. In particular, a massless scalar three-point integral can be expressed as a graphical function. The result follows immediately from a theorem by M. Golz, E. Panzer and the author on parametric representations of position space integrals (2015), but it was only observed by X. Jiang in 2025 in the context of four-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills theory. We generalize Jiang's result and discuss the consequences of the self-duality in the context of graphical functions. In particular, we derive a new identity for graphical functions and a new twist relation for scalar integrals (Feynman periods) in $φ^4$ theory."

    "abstract": "Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) primarily emphasize convergent logical reasoning, where success is defined by producing a single correct proof. However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth. LogicGraph exposes this divergence gap and provides actionable insights to motivate future improvements. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/kkkkarry/LogicGraph."

    "abstract": "Towards understanding the statistical complexity of learning from heterogeneous sources, we study the problem of multi-distribution learning. Given $k$ data sources, the goal is to output a classifier for each source by exploiting shared structure to reduce sample complexity. We focus on the bounded label noise setting to determine whether the fast $1/ε$ rates achievable in single-task learning extend to this regime with minimal dependence on $k$. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case. We demonstrate that learning across $k$ distributions inherently incurs slow rates scaling with $k/ε^2$, even under constant noise levels, unless each distribution is learned separately. A key technical contribution is a structured hypothesis-testing framework that captures the statistical cost of certifying near-optimality under bounded noise-a cost we show is unavoidable in the multi-distribution setting. Finally, we prove that when competing with the stronger benchmark of each distribution's optimal Bayes error, the sample complexity incurs a \\textit{multiplicative} penalty in $k$. This establishes a \\textit{statistical} separation between random classification noise and Massart noise, highlighting a fundamental barrier unique to learning from multiple sources."

Here, we present a Python package for determining the symmetry-restricted forms of tensors describing physical properties of crystals, focusing particularly on magnetic materials. The primary focus is on response tensors; however, the program can also describe equilibrium properties and other physical properties, such as magnetic interactions. The program can describe the symmetry using the conventional magnetic space groups, as well as using the spin groups that describe the non-relativistic limit. Additional functionality includes the treatment of quantities projected onto a particular site and expansions in the magnetic order parameter. The code can be used either from the command line or via a Python API."

Our approach models the joint evolution of outcomes for treated and control units through a GP prior that ensures exchangeability across units while allowing for flexible nonlinear trends over time. The resulting posterior predictive distribution for the untreated potential outcomes of the treated unit provides a counterfactual path, from which we derive pointwise and cumulative treatment effects, along with credible intervals to quantify uncertainty. We implement several variations of the exchangeable GP model using different kernel functions. To assess prediction accuracy, we conduct a placebo-style validation within the pre-intervention window by selecting a ``fake'' intervention date. Ultimately, this study illustrates how exchangeable GPs serve as a flexible tool for policy evaluation in panel data settings and proposes a novel approach to staggered-adoption designs with a large number of treated and control units."

This work studies digital OAC with QAM-based signaling under heavy-tailed interference modeled by a Cauchy distribution (lacking a finite second moment). We seek QAM-like constellations that minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of sum aggregation subject to an average-power constraint. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization, whose solution yields unique optimality conditions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design.

We study the problem of representing Robinson dissimilarity spaces into low-dimensional metric spaces. These representations aim to preserve the relative dissimilarity relationships between elements rather than their exact values. While low dimensional Euclidean spaces such as $\\mathbb{R}^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are natural candidates for such embeddings, previous work has shown that not all Robinson spaces admit a valid embedding in the real line that respects their structural constraints. Motivated by this limitation, we explore the broader class of real trees, which retain low-dimensional interpretability while allowing greater flexibility. To address the embedding problem, we develop two key tools: a combinatorial representation of Robinson spaces and a topological characterization of caterpillars, a restricted class of real trees. These tools enable a formulation of the embedding problem as a linear program, providing both computational and theoretical insights. We prove that some subclasses of Robinson spaces always admit embeddings in a caterpillar, and we establish the existence of Robinson spaces that cannot be embedded in any real tree. These results clarify the geometric limitations of representing ordered dissimilarity structures and open new directions for studying the interaction between dissimilarity, order, and metric geometry."

    "abstract": "The Quantum Internet will allow clients to delegate quantum workloads to remote servers over heterogeneous networks, but choosing the server that minimizes end-to-end execution time is difficult because server processing, feedforward classical communication, and entanglement distribution can overlap in protocol-dependent ways and shift the runtime bottleneck. We propose $T_{\\max}$, a lightweight runtime score that sums coarse telemetry from multiple layers to obtain a conservative ranking for online server selection without calibrating weights for each deployment. Using NetSquid discrete-event simulations of a modified parameter-blind VQE (PB-VQE) workload, we evaluate $T_{\\max}$ on pools of 10,000 heterogeneous candidates (selecting among up to 100 per decision) across crossover and bottleneck-dominated regimes, including temporal jitter scenarios and jobs with multiple shots. $T_{\\max}$ achieves single-digit mean regret normalized by the oracle (below 10%) in both regimes and remains in the single-digit range under classical communication latency jitter for multi-shot jobs, while performance degrades for single-shot jobs under severe jitter. To connect performance to deployment planning, we derive an operating map based on requirements relating distance and entanglement rate requirements to protocol level counts, quantify how simple multiuser contention shifts the crossover, and use Sobol global sensitivity analysis to identify regime-dependent bottlenecks. These findings suggest that simple cross-layer telemetry can enable practical server selection while providing actionable provisioning guidance for emerging Quantum Internet services."

    "abstract": "To interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the molecular coordinates to a low-dimensional collective variable $x$. Projecting the high-dimensional MD data onto $x$ yields a free energy landscape $ΔG(x)$, which highlights low-energy regions corresponding to conformational states. The accurate definition of these states, however, is often impeded by projection artifacts, resulting in artificially shortened state lifetimes or even the complete disappearance of states from the analysis. As demonstrated for a two-dimensional toy model, Gaussian low-pass filtering of the high-dimensional MD coordinates can restore the underlying free energy landscape, allowing to recover previously hidden states. When applied to an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, the number of microstates increases by an order of magnitude, which leads to metastable states that are long-lived and much better defined structurally, even compared to dynamically cored state trajectories."

The sample consists of 11 confirmed black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), 10 black hole candidates (BHC), and 21 neutron star X-ray binaries (NSXBs). Outbursts and flaring activities studied over 13 years show that 19/21 NSXBs spend significantly longer time in the hard state (observations for which hardness ratio is $\\geq$ 0.2) while 15/21 BHXB+XRC spend substantially longer time in the soft state (observations for which hardness ratio is $<$ 0.2). The frequency distribution of the hardness ratio clearly shows two distinct distributions for BHXBs and NSXBs, with their peaks separated: NSXBs prefer harder values, while BHXBs prefer softer values of hardness. Our model-independent analysis for 42 transient sources shows that statistically NSXBs do not prefer to show a canonical high soft state as observed in BHXBs. Additionally, the probability distribution of the duration of the 2-20 keV X-ray outburst is observed to peak at a significantly longer duration ($>$100 days) for BHXBs than for NSXBs (15-60 days). Our analysis shows that among candidate sources, Swift J1728.9-3613, MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1659-152, EXO 1846-031 show a `q' diagram in the HID and prefer to align with the HID frequency distribution of BHXBs that show `q' diagram, MAXI J1305-704 and MAXI J1836-194 align with frequency distribution of black hole sources without `q' diagram while MAXI J1848-015 shows the HID distribution similar to NSXBs, indicating a neutron star accretor. Therefore, a long-term statistical study of MAXI and Swift/BAT X-ray outbursts from a large sample of transient sources may be used to distinguish BHXB from NSXB."

To address this limitation, we propose CrystaL (Crystallized Latent Reasoning), a single-stage framework with two paths to process intact and corrupted images, respectively. By explicitly aligning the attention patterns and prediction distributions across the two paths, CrystaL crystallizes latent representations into task-relevant visual semantics, without relying on auxiliary annotations or external modules. Extensive experiments on perception-intensive benchmarks demonstrate that CrystaL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities."

The second pillar is the programming language and APIs (or tools) that these agents use to accomplish tasks, and increasingly, serve as the communication substrate that humans and AI agents interact and collaborate through. The final pillar is the runtime environment and ecosystem that agents operate within, and which provide the capabilities that programmatic agents use to interface with (and effect actions in) the external world. To realize the vision of AISE, all three pillars must be advanced in a holistic manner, and critically, in a manner that is synergistic for AI agents as they exist today, those that will exist in the future, and for the human developers that work alongside them."

The equations provide a non-hydrostatic but quasi-geostrophic description in a non-orthogonal coordinate system. The tilt changes the structure of the large-scale barotropic condensate from large-scale vortices to zonal flows as the colatitude of the $f$-plane increases, with bistable states present for certain parameter ranges, extending prior work to a geophysically significant parameter regime. This behaviour is understood through the impact of broken rotation symmetry on the barotropic source terms resulting from baroclinic vortical stresses and baroclinic torque. As the tilt angle $\\vartheta_f$ increases, global heat and momentum transport is reduced relative to upright-polar convection, a result that is explained through linear theory and nonlinear power maps both of which demonstrate increased attenuation of the domain of dynamically active spatial scales as the convective modes depart from a North-South alignment in the horizontal plane. A key finding is that the predominance of lateral thermal mixing allows for the maintenance of a persistent unstable mean temperature gradient that saturates at increasing forcing levels and remains insensitive to the colatitude."

    "abstract": "To achieve the objectives of efficient wireless charging and timely data collection in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs), this paper proposes a joint scheduling scheme for UAV that optimizes both charging and data collection tasks. First, the network area is divided into sparse and non-sparse grids. A Sparse Grid Fusion Algorithm based on Minimum Enclosing Circle (SGFMC) is introduced to reduce the number of UAV hovering points in sparse grids, thereby improving energy replenishment efficiency. Then, for non-sparse grids, a clustering approach based on minimizing energy radiation area is employed to shrink the energy coverage of UAV, effectively shortening the distance between the UAV and sensor nodes and enhancing energy efficiency. Next, the charging priority of cluster head nodes is determined by jointly considering their residual energy and the UAV’s vertical displacement during flight. This not only reduces UAV’s energy consumption during vertical movement but also ensures fairness in charging. A binary search-based allocation strategy is then applied to optimally distribute UAV energy among cluster head nodes. Furthermore, to minimize the energy consumption of cluster heads when transmitting data to the UAV during data collection, an adaptive UAV hovering altitude adjustment strategy is introduced. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing algorithms such as HEC, HSA, and SA, the proposed SGFMC strategy significantly improves UAV flight distance efficiency and overall energy utilization."

    "abstract": "Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT), as a rapidly developing process tomography technique, has been widely applied in multiphase flow monitoring, industrial process control, and medical imaging. However, due to the “soft-field” effect, the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, and limitations in data acquisition. Existing reconstruction methods generally suffer from large reconstruction errors, low accuracy, blurred edges, and pronounced artifacts. To address these issues, this paper proposed a reconstruction method based on fractional-order particle filtering and image super-resolution. Firstly, a fractional-order formulation is introduced into the system equation to better characterize the dynamic behavior of the ECT system, by exploiting the short-term memory property of fractional-order systems, thereby accelerating convergence in the search space. Subsequently, the particle filter is employed to effectively alleviate the “soft-field” effect of the ECT system. By directly approximating the posterior probability distribution of the system state through Monte Carlo sampling, more informative particles can be selected, which enhances reconstruction accuracy and stability. Finally, an image super-resolution model based on Lorentzian function fitting is adopted, where the point spread function is estimated and combined with the Lucy–Richardson algorithm to achieve high-resolution imaging and mitigate edge blurring.In the experimental study, a three-dimensional simulation model was established using COMSOL, and a 12-electrode hardware platform was constructed for validation under various typical flow patterns. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior image quality while maintaining low computational cost (less than 0.3 s), providing an effective solution for ECT imaging in complex industrial environments."

The diffusion mechanism plays a critical role by modeling the spatially distributed state variations among agents, facilitating the continuous propagation of state information across the system and enabling distributed interactions. To address the challenges posed by spatially distributed states and the requirement for achieving consensus within a predefined time, the strongly continuous semigroup theory is utilized to establish the structured solvability of the system dynamics governed by diffusion PDEs. Building on this theoretical foundation, new predefined-time control protocols are designed for both leaderless and leader follower consensus scenarios. These protocols guarantee user specified time convergence, irrespective of initial conditions. Furthermore, the convergence principle is applied alongside a Lyapunov functional approach to derive sufficient conditions for achieving predefined-time consensus under the proposed control mechanism. Finally, numerical examples are conducted to verify the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Online learning for data streams has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing methods impose various limitations on the feature space, classes, and labels of data streams. In contrast, real-world data streams often exhibit dynamic feature spaces, missing or partial feature values, undefined classes, and inaccessible labels. These complexities limit the applicability of current online learning methods to real-world scenarios. To fill the gap, this study explores a new online learning problem and proposes a novel algorithm: <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><b>O</b></u>nline <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><b>L</b></u>earning for <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><b>F</b></u>ickle Data Streams without <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><b>L</b></u>abels (OLFL). Specifically, OLFL has a triple main idea: 1) It tackles dimensional turbulence through a completion strategy that collaborates with weight vectors, reducing the over-reliance on surviving features; 2) It implements known class classification and new class detection via the density of core points within the neighborhood of each instance; 3) It utilizes a constraint-based adaptive coefficient vector to update model. We evaluate OLFL on extensive real-world and synthetic datasets against strong baselines, covering fickle feature spaces, emerging classes, and varying missingness rates. We further conduct ablation studies and case analyses. The results consistently show that OLFL outperforms the baselines in both accuracy and efficiency."

This paper conducts an in-depth study on the time-variance of DSSR for the first time, pointing out and addressing the problem it causes. Firstly, the existing DSSR model is introduced. The reason for the time-variance is analyzed: FR regulations are reflected in the region varying. The problem caused by the time-variance of DSSR is also analyzed, namely that the region-based method will lose its speed advantage in online security analysis. Secondly, a time-invariant DSSR model and its security analysis method are proposed, considering complete types of FRs and N-1 security. The key to addressing the time-variance of DSSR is to reflect FR regulations as the operating point movement. Finally, the proposed model and method are verified in a real case and a large case, and compared with the existing research. The comparison shows that the proposed model maintains the speed advantage of the region-based method in security analysis. This work establishes a link between time-variant DSSR and time-invariant DSSR, laying a key foundation for practical applications of DSSR in smart distribution networks."

    "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a key enabler for meeting the stringent performance demands of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. However, the presence of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in industrial environments introduces additional complexity due to mobility-induced interference, fading conditions, and intermittent line-of-sight (LoS). This paper develops an integrated MEC-assisted IIoT framework that incorporates AMRs, small-cell base stations (SBSs), macro-cell base stations (MBSs), and edge caching capabilities. Within this framework, we investigate how different association mechanisms influence downlink energy efficiency. Three representative association strategies are considered: a distance-oriented approach, a cache-aware method that prioritizes local content availability, and a cloud-centric policy. To quantify their performance, we derive semi-analytical expressions that capture the effects of industrial propagation factors and network heterogeneity. The numerical evaluation reveals that cache-driven association markedly enhances energy efficiency compared to strategies that do not exploit edge caching, underscoring the importance of cache-centric designs in future IIoT deployments."

However, in dynamic UAV-assisted environments, some existing approaches lack adaptability and struggle to effectively balance delay and energy consumption. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint optimization problem that minimizes the weighted sum of delay and energy consumption, where adaptive weight factors are dynamically adjusted according to system state variations. Due to the non-convex and high-dimensional nature of our proposed problem, traditional optimization methods are generally inadequate. Hence, the problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and a normalization-based reward function is designed to eliminate the dimensional imbalance between delay and energy consumption. A Dynamic Normalization Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DN-TD3) algorithm is then proposed, which incorporates mechanisms of adaptive exploration and criticdriven policy updates to enhance convergence stability and reduce sensitivity to hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DN-TD3 algorithm outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of system cost reduction, convergence speed, and overall stability."

The VET was preliminary validated with amputees and healthy individuals, demonstrating construct validity, but also highlighting some weaknesses that required a protocol revision. Here, we present the update version of the protocol and of the outcomes measure (Fine Dexterity Index – FDI - and Gross Dexterity Index - GDI). We carried on a clinical trial involving 79 healthy participants, stratified by age groups, to collect normative data and evaluate test-retest reliability. The FDI and the GDI demonstrate no significant difference between test and retest. FDI showed excellent reliability (ICC was 0.90 and 0.91 for the dominant and non-dominant hand, respectively). While GDI demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC was equal to 0.63 and 0.64 for the dominant and non-dominant hand, respectively).

    "abstract": "Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has greatly advanced the development of novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks, it still faces serious challenges in indoor scenes with only sparse views due to the lack of initialization point cloud. Existing GS-like methods are geometrically initialized using point clouds from Structure from Motion (SfM), and their performance is heavily limited by the point cloud quality. However, in indoor scenes containing large areas of textureless or weakly textured regions, the SfM algorithm struggles to generate point clouds in these areas, especially when only a limited number of input views are available. This situation can cause the GS optimization process to overfit the photometric error, resulting in severe geometric degradation in regions lacking proper initialization. To address the above problem, we propose a novel sparse-view 3DGS method using global scale-aligned monocular depth to initialize Gaussian primitives and optimize them in view space, named VGA-GS. First, we design a global scale-aligned monocular depth initialization strategy, which provides geometric priors in textureless or weakly textured regions while avoiding the local geometric distortions in vanilla alignments. Second, we propose a novel Gaussian primitive representation based on view space and a refinement strategy based on pixel errors, which can constrain each primitive to always be within the field of view where it is observed to be fully optimized. Finally, we extract the surface prior from monocular depth to regularize the rendering depth and normal, and further propagate the constraints of the training view to the neighboring pseudo-views via image warping. Our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in both textureless regions and local details for indoor scenes with sparse views. Moreover, it is highly scalable, supporting integration with various 3DGS rasterizers and depth estimation methods. We release the code at https://github.com/XT5un/VGA-GS."

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems with large array have pushed radar sensing into a new era, thanks to their high angular resolution. However, our long-term experiments indicate that array elements exhibit phase drift over time and require periodic phase calibration to maintain high-resolution, creating an obstacle for practical high-resolution mmWave sensing with large array. Unfortunately, existing calibration methods are inadequate for periodic recalibration, either because they rely on artificial references or fail to provide sufficient precision. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoCalib, the first framework designed to automatically and accurately calibrate high-resolution mmWave radars by identifying Ambient Radio Anchors (ARAs)—naturally existing objects in ambient environments that offer stable phase references. AutoCalib achieves calibration by first generating spatial spectrum templates based on theoretical electromagnetic characteristics. It then employs a pattern-matching and scoring mechanism to accurately detect these anchors and select the optimal one for calibration. Extensive experiments across 11 environments demonstrate that AutoCalib is capable of identifying ARAs that existing methods miss due to their focus on strong reflectors. AutoCalib's calibration performance approaches corner reflectors (74% phase error reduction) while outperforming existing methods by 83%. Beyond radar calibration, AutoCalib effectively supports other phase-dependent applications like handheld imaging, delivering 96% of corner reflector calibration performance without artificial references."

    "abstract": "Sea clutter in coastal waters exhibits spatial heterogeneity and fast-varying Doppler spectra along radial distance. Due to the limited number of reference cells, even less than the integrated pulses, longtime adaptive coherent detection fails or has a severe performance degradation. Post-Doppler detection, known as general moving target detection (MTD), can work well in this case, which requires fewer reference cells and lower computational cost. In this paper, MTDs in compound- Gaussian clutter are proved to be of constant false alarm rate (CFAR), and the CFAR thresholds are determined by the number of reference cells, the shape parameter, the false alarm rate, and the clutter power estimator at each Doppler bin. The detection probability is proved to be determined by signal-to-clutter ratio after integration (SCR-AI) and threshold. Moreover, it is revealed that MTDs are superior to adaptive near-optimum coherent detectors in K-, GP-, and CGIG distributed clutter with moderate and large shape parameters when the reference cells are no more than twice the integrated pulses. The boundary conditions of the two kinds of detectors are given. As another contribution, longtime adaptive near-optimum coherent detectors via robust speckle covariance matrix inversion based on firstorder AR adaptive loading are proposed, working well when the reference cells are much less than the integrated pulses and remedying the poor performance of MTDs at small shape parameters. Finally, the longtime adaptive near-optimum detectors are verified by P- and X-band measured radar data, which can cooperate with MTDs effectively to detect low-velocity small targets in heterogeneous sea clutter."

The proposed design strikes a balance between compactness, broad bandwidth, and manufacturability. To validate the concept and performance, a 30-dB coupler prototype is fabricated and measured. In addition, an innovative ultrawideband transition from ridge gap waveguide to coaxial line is introduced to ensure efficient excitation over the desired frequency band. Measurements confirm that the coupler achieves an exceptional fractional bandwidth exceeding 107% within the 12–40-GHz range. Experimental results indicate that the coupler maintains a return loss (RL) greater than 13dB and exhibits directivity exceeding 15dB, while achieving the coupling levels of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$31.5~\\pm ~1.2$</tex-math> </inline-formula>dB over the full Ku-, K-, and Ka-bands. Compared to similar couplers, the proposed design exhibits remarkable properties, including an ultrawide bandwidth, compact size, stable coupling value, and low insertion loss (IL).

    "abstract": "We propose machine learning (ML) power, the first ML-based framework that: 1) accelerates end-to-end RTL power estimation by addressing both its key bottlenecks—RTL simulation and power-model evaluation—and 2) extends ML-based power models to system-on-chips (SoCs) with configurable intellectual property (IP) blocks. ML-Power builds models that predict power versus time traces of each SoC block using a very small subset of internal signals called power proxies. The framework is composed of three components: ML-based power proxy activity estimation (PACE), exploiting spatio-temporal correlations for power proxy selection and ML-based power model evaluation (SCOPE), and representative configuration selection using active learning (RECAL). PACE trains a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) ML model to translate a transaction-level execution trace into a cycle-level trace of the power proxy signals, allowing much faster simulation models to be used in place of RTL simulation. SCOPE selects power proxies and trains ML-based power models for each block within the SoC. RECAL enables ML-Power to handle SoCs with configurable intellectual property (IP) blocks by using active learning to select a small subset of representative configurations, which are then used to train a unified power model that generalizes across the entire design space. We evaluate ML-Power on an ARM SSE-300 SoC and two RISC-V-based SoCs. Compared to prior state-of-the-art ML-based power estimation frameworks, SCOPE trains power models <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim 65\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> faster, picks 40% fewer proxies, and achieves 2% lower estimation error.

How to reduce the transmission latency and improve the transmission reliability is challenging for the future network design. To achieve this, we propose a full-duplex (FD) cooperative rate-splitting and precoding design for finite blocklength transmission in downlink URLLC systems. Adopting FD mode can make full utilization of the time resources, and rate-splitting can manage the inter-user interference flexibly by splitting the original message into the common and private parts. A typical scenario is considered where the relay user has the ability of simultaneous information reception and common stream forwarding. We formulate a transmission power minimization problem to jointly optimize the beamformers, the rate-splitting factors and the transmission power of relay user while meeting the URLLC requirements. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose an effective iterative method. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with other baseline schemes, benefiting from the cooperation gain and the interference management ability of rate-splitting."

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has become a key enabler for ubiquitous sensing in 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G wireless networks, where a significant use case is the high-reliability drone detection in urban low-altitude airspace. While ISAC base stations (BSs) enable continuous aerial coverage through scalable networking, existing implementations exhibit severe resource inefficiencies: (1) Single beam-position coverage (beyond 1 km altitude) greatly exceeds most drone activities (below 300 m altitude), leading to significant energy waste in upper aerial beam positions. (2) Conventional designs optimized for maximum sensing coverage result in excessive resource redundancy in dense urban deployments, since the intersite distances of the BSs are typically reduced to 30-50% below the theoretical maximum coverage to mitigate building blockages. In this paper, we propose a new framework for optimizing the sensing coverage and resource efficiency of the ISAC systems. We first present an air interface design consisting of hybrid waveform and new frame structure. Moreover, we propose a novel coverage optimization scheme based on link budget analysis, including non-uniform sensing symbol allocation and adaptive pulse reception window. Simulation results demonstrate a 33% reduction in computational overhead with proportional interference suppression, while delivering 6 dB coherent integration gain for prioritized beam position."

    "abstract": "With the development of communication technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is playing an increasingly important role in real life, and the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication in IoT has also been widely studied. This work presents a data-collection scheme. Based on the UAV trajectory designing and the scheduling strategy for Sensor Nodes(SNs), a weighted maximization model of energy efficiency is constructed to maximize the weighted sum of energy efficiency, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem that is usually difficult to solve directly. Firstly, we decomposes the problem into three sub-problems and the lower bounds of the UAV trajectory were found by applying the first-order Taylor expansion. Then, a joint optimization algorithm based on Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) is proposed to obtain a local optimal solution that satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the effective balance between the transmission rate and the energy consumption of the sensor nodes is realized, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Multi-site magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are significantly affected by site-specific biases arising from variations in scanners and imaging protocols across different sites, severely compromising the cross-site generalizability of deep learning models. To address this issue, this paper introduces a content-style disentanglement-based harmonization method for multi-site MRI data, which employs separate content and style encoders to disentangle anatomical content information from site-specific stylistic features. Furthermore, a Triplet Attention mechanism is integrated into the bottleneck layer of the content encoder to enhance the modeling of multidimensional dependencies within complex content structures. Experimental results on the IXI dataset demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our model achieves a 18.3% improvement in PSNR, a 13.3% increase in SSIM, and a 56.2% reduction in MSE on the HH-to-Guys harmonization task. It also exhibits consistently superior performance on the IOP-to-Guys harmonization task. Meanwhile, site classification experiments show that the SVM classification accuracy decreases from 90.0% to 48.3% after harmonization, indicating the effective removal of site-specific characteristics. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully eliminates site-related biases while preserving fine anatomical structural details, offering an effective data harmonization solution for multi-site MRI studies."

    "abstract": "Adversarial training-based generative methods have shown strong performance in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), but they often come with significant drawbacks — including training instability and high computational cost. These approaches typically use the same feature generation pipeline for both Conventional ZSL (CZSL), where test classes are strictly unseen, and Generalized ZSL (GZSL), where both seen and unseen classes are present during inference. In this work, we argue that such frameworks are unnecessarily expensive for CZSL setups, where the primary objective is accurate recognition of unseen classes. We propose CZSL-SGNSF, a non-adversarial generative method that synthesizes unseen visual features and further enhances them through semantic graph propagation by enabling knowledge transfers across related unseen categories. For classification, we introduce a classifier trained jointly with cross-entropy and KL-divergence objectives on visual-semantic contrast. Extensive experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art adversarial methods in CZSL performance with significantly lower computational overhead for feature synthesis, while achieving promising results in both CZSL and GZSL compared to non-adversarial methods."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a prominent architecture for scaling large language models (LLMs). In particular, leveraging readily available fine-tuned LLMs as experts provides an efficient and flexible approach to developing MoE LLMs. However, integrating highly capable but untrustworthy LLMs into an MoE system poses a significant safety risk, potentially compromising the overall safety of the MoE LLM system. To date, no study has explored how adversaries compromise an MoE LLM service by introducing a poisoned expert LLM. In this paper, we introduce MOEVIL, a novel expert poisoning attack designed to compromise the safety of MoE LLMs. We address the dissipation of harmful effects from a target expert within MoE systems by conducting harmful preference learning. Next, we strategically manipulate this expert's latent vector to deceive the gating networks. This manipulation indirectly steers routing decisions toward the poisoned expert when generating responses to harmful queries. MOEVIL demonstrates strong attack performance across diverse MoE configurations based on both Llama and Qwen LLMs, even when poisoning only a single expert. MOEVIL increases the harmfulness score from 0.58 to 79.42 in a Llama-based MoE LLM, outperforming existing harmful poisoning attacks. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that even safety alignment, when combined with an efficient MoE training strategy, fails to fully mitigate these risks. Our findings demonstrate the significant threat posed by harmful experts in MoE systems, underscoring the need for robust safety measures in MoE-based LLM development.

To solve this, low-temperature P b-free solders with S n - B i based lower bonding temperature have been gotten attentions.

Currently, the identification of MRs relies mainly on domain experts, which leads to low efficiency and considerable subjectivity in MR formulation. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential for identifying MRs automatically. In this paper, we propose a self-verificationbased prompt construction strategy for MR identification, which consists of two stages: MR identification and MR verification. Our method is applied to the thermal-hydraulic safety design program for pebble-bed high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, with deepseek-R1 as the underlying model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach not only covers all 44 MRs identified by experts, but also discovers 24 new MRs. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of coverage rate, accuracy rate, and innovation rate, thereby exhibiting superior identification capability. The research results not only advance the study of MR identification, but also provide a valuable reference and inspiration for researchers."

    "abstract": "In agile development, user stories are used to express user requirements, which employ simple natural language sentences. As software scales grow and evolve continuously, managing user stories becomes increasingly challenging, necessitating the modeling of user stories to clarify their associated semantics. Currently, representing user stories as goal models is an effective approach. However, extracting the semantics of the goal models from user stories is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. In particular, abstracting low-level user stories into high-level goals remains difficult and relies heavily on the expertise of requirements engineers. This paper leverages the knowledge extraction and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to divide the goal model extraction task into two categories: explicit concept extraction and implicit concept extraction. This classification is based on direct extraction from the user story field (explicit) and extraction according to implicit semantics (implicit). A multi-strategy prompting method (MSPM) is devised, which combines prompt templates, few-shot learning, ReAct, and chain-of-thought techniques to suit explicit and implicit goal model concept extraction, ultimately generating iStar models. The experimental results show that the proposed method has an average F 1 scores of 97.9% and 92.7% for the nodes and relationships in the extraction of the goal model, and has advantages in the completeness of the extraction of the goal modeling element."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their applications have expanded into diverse fields, such as code assistance. However, the substantial size of LLMs makes their training highly resource- and time-consuming, which leads to lengthy retraining and delayed updating. Consequently, LLMs trained based on old data may generate outdated results. This becomes extremely critical in the scenario of avoiding vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities are discovered every day. Without updating their knowledge, LLMs may inadvertently generate code that includes these newly discovered vulnerabilities. Current strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not effectively address this issue. Prompt engineering fails to equip LLMs with comprehensive, up-to-date knowledge, while fine-tuning remains prohibitively resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we study the problem of LLM recommending outdated APIs and propose a new solution, named APILOT, which maintains a real-time, quickly updatable dataset of outdated APIs. Additionally, APILOT utilizes pre-constructed cache prediction and augmented generation methods that leverage this dataset to navigate LLMs in generating secure, version-aware code. We conducted a comprehensive empirical evaluation of APILOT across seventeen state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including both open-source and commercial systems. The results demonstrate that APILOT reduces outdated API recommendations by an average of 75%, with some models achieving up to 100% mitigation in specific large language models. Notably, these improvements are achieved with minimal performance overhead. Interestingly, while enhancing security, APILOT also improves the usability of LLM -generated code by an average of 37%, with gains reaching up to 85.6% in certain large language models. Importantly, these improvements are achieved without compromising code functionality, as measured by ICE-SCORE evaluations across diverse prompts and LLMs. This demonstrates APILOT's dual benefit─it not only reduces the risk of outdated API usage but also enhances the practical utility and deployability of generated code. Together, these results highlight APILOT 's potential to improve both security and developer experience in real-world AI-assisted programming environments."

    "abstract": "Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is theoretically proven to render memory access patterns of a computation completely uniform, mitigating memory side-channel attacks. However, it is accompanied by orders of magnitude slower memory access latency and, thus, is often impractical in many circumstances. On the other hand, Processing-In-Memory (PIM) has been advancing as a solution to accelerate memory-intensive work-loads and mitigate the memory wall problem. In this paper, we explore the new direction of in-DRAM oblivious RAM with a design named PIM-ORAM. We retrofit the currently available commodity PIM hardware to provide future direction for secure computation on PIM, and design PIM-ORAM. Our design proposes split-data ORAM, a parallelizable in-memory ORAM scheme that takes full advantage of the parallel computing power of the PIM while retaining the original security guarantee of ORAM and dealing with the constraints existing in the commodity PIM. We evaluate PIM-ORAM using the PIM -enabled testbed cloud to provide more realistic numerical values. The evaluation shows that PIM-ORAM alleviates the increase of memory bus usage and ORAM access latency when the ORAM capacity increases."

In LAINs, the nodes have to meet required communication performance, such as large bandwidth, low latency, and high reliability under challenging spectrum usage situations with strong interference and high complexity. As a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, MAPPO can provide an efficient DSA solution for distributed nodes in LAINs to address spectrum usage challenges. The key obstacles in using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to solve problems related to wireless communications are latency and convergence issues. In order to overcome these limitations, an adaptive sliding clip (ASC) mechanism is included in the MAPPO algorithm to enable faster and more stable convergence during the deployment phase. Simulation results indicate that MAPPO can outperform traditional DRL algorithms in solving the DSA problem within LAINs. Meanwhile, the ASC mechanism enables MAPPO to achieve enhanced adaptability in dynamic spectrum environments."

Traditional prediction models often struggle to capture the complex nonlinear and multi-scale characteristics of turbulence. To address this issue, this paper develops a multi-step turbulence prediction framework that integrates wavelet decomposition with deep learning. The study is based on Doppler lidar wind field observation data from the approach airspace of Kashgar Airport in 2024, aiming to predict turbulence variations over the next fifteen minutes. The model first employs two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform to extract multi-scale time-frequency features from the wind speed matrices, and then uses correlation analysis to select key indicators, thereby enhancing the physical interpretability of the features. A hybrid deep learning framework is proposed by integrating a Transformer module for capturing global periodic patterns, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for extracting local disturbance features, and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network for modeling bidirectional temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the proposed fusion model consistently outperforms all the baseline models used for comparison in terms of EDR prediction accuracy, stability, and generalization capability."

The method begins by transforming raw single frequency echosounder data into Sv matrices, followed by preprocessing that includes matrix rotation and NaN handling to preserve spatial fidelity. Initial segmentation is performed using three-class Otsu thresholding, which partitions acoustic intensities into substrate, intermediate, and background classes. These segmented masks are refined through morphological operations and hole-filling to eliminate noise. Subsequently, substrate class masks are used to detect seafloor boundaries, from which depth and distance-to-bottom maps are derived. This spatial context is then employed to redefine ecological labels—substrate, plankton, demersal, and pelagic—based on vertical structure and acoustic profile. The resulting labeled echograms are organized into fixed-size patches that match the input dimensions required for spatially aware deep learning models. Feature evaluations using PCA and LDA confirm the discriminative power of the spatial-acoustic representations across ecological classes. Performance-wise, the pipeline significantly reduces manual annotation effort, standardizes preprocessing across samples, and integrates class-balanced sampling to mitigate bias from dominant substrates or background regions. Overall, this framework enables scalable, consistent, and ecologically meaningful labeling of echogram datasets, supporting downstream applications in marine biomass estimation and habitat monitoring."

Cognitive spectrum-division transmission (SDT) provides an effective solution for such interference resistance by dividing broadband signals into sub-spectra transmitted over idle regions of the cognitive radio spectrum, effectively mitigating the impact of interference. However, interference may still occur in a few sub-spectra of the system, leading to increased bit error rate (BER). In this paper, a frequency-domain coding (FC) scheme is proposed to further enhance the resilience of SDT systems against interference by constructing structured redundant sub-spectra. To mitigate SNR loss, the encoding matrix is optimized. Moreover, the decoding method is developed in known and unknown interfered sub-spectra cases. Finally, simulation results show that the FC scheme significantly reduces BER degradation induced by interfered sub-spectra, outperforming recovery techniques based on time-domain error correction code."

This study investigates the impact of sensor arrangements on localization accuracy. Comparison between interior and exterior sensor array configurations using digital twin data had been made, employing iterative algorithms including Newton Iterative, Particle Swarm Optimization, Whale Optimization Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization and Grey Wolf Optimization) for PD coordinate estimation.

    "abstract": "Relational databases (RDBs) have been widely utilized for managing and analyzing large-scale business data. However, analyzing RDBs with machine learning techniques requires complex feature engineering, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and prone to information loss. Recent research in relational deep learning (RDL) attempts to map RDB data to graph structures, enabling direct learning via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite these efforts, current methods face challenges such as long path lengths between semantically related nodes, which negatively affect model performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel graph enrichment method that integrates both primary key-foreign key (PK-FK) relationships and semantic information derived from textual descriptions in RDB records. The proposed method utilizes semantic clustering on textual data to generate additional nodes and their corresponding edges. This enriched graph is then incorporated into the GNN model, enhancing the propagation of relevant information by reducing path lengths between semantically related nodes. Furthermore, this paper introduces a weight-based adjustment mechanism for the additionally generated nodes to account for potential uncertainty in clustering results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the performance of GNNs compared to the RDL method."

The existing standard static replacement policies do not adapt to the dynamic nature of memory access patterns and the diversity of computer programs. This paper explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) to improve cache performance by learning access patterns and predicting optimal eviction candidates. The proposed methodology implements an XGBoost-based replacement policy in the ChampSim simulator, leveraging features such as memory addresses, program counters (PCs), access types, reuse distances, and temporal locality. The model is trained on trace data collected from cache operations, achieving 90% classification accuracy on held-out cache trace data in predicting eviction candidates. The performance of the XGBoost-based replacement policy is evaluated against standard replacement policies across multiple benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 suite. Key metrics such as Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) and cache hit rates are analyzed to assess improvements. Results demonstrate that the ML-driven policy can reduce cache misses and improve cache performance, particularly in workloads with irregular access patterns."

    "abstract": "Dynamic obstacle avoidance constitutes a critical component in enabling autonomous mobility and safe operation of robots. In complex and dynamically changing operational environments, robots must possess real-time obstacle detection and dynamic path planning capabilities. This study employs a spider parallel robot as the platform, integrating an RGB-D depth camera and an inertial measurement unit to construct an environmental perception system, thereby providing the robot with multimodal information such as three-dimensional visual data and attitude angles. Firstly, an enhanced object detection model, YOLOv4-M, is proposed based on YOLOv4. By incorporating an additional detection layer, introducing a spatial pyramid pooling structure, and optimizing anchor boxes using K-means clustering, the model improves the accuracy and robustness of multi-scale obstacle recognition. The model identifies and localizes obstacles within color images and employs depth map alignment techniques to determine obstacle dimensions and their spatial distances relative to the robot. Based on real-time robot attitude data and obstacle identification results, an improved artificial potential field-based obstacle avoidance decision-making model is developed. This model integrates a dead-zone distance mechanism and a dynamic steering strategy to effectively address local minima issues inherent in traditional potential field methods, thereby enabling dynamic walking path planning. The generated decision commands are transmitted to the robot's motion control unit, ultimately achieving autonomous obstacle avoidance in unknown environments. Both simulation and physical experiments validate that the proposed system effectively accomplishes autonomous obstacle avoidance tasks for the spider parallel robot. This research provides a technical foundation and reference for obstacle recognition and autonomous navigation in robots relying solely on visual and inertial sensors."

We assessed 9 reflective constructs: Data Quality, HIL Effectiveness, Perceived Accuracy, Explainability, Fairness & Equity, Trust, Perceived Scalability, Economic Viability, and Adoption Intention, using five-point Likert scales, on a crosssectional survey of 276 stakeholders in waste operations. Measurement and structural relations were measured using partial least squares structural equation modeling (SmartPLS; Mode A). Its measurement model exhibited high reliability and convergent validity (outer loadings were mostly above. 80, AVE was above. 70), moderate discriminant validity, and acceptable fit (SRMR was about 0.5). Perceived accuracy structurality Data Quality and HIL Effectiveness were the drivers of perceived accuracy, Trust was dominated by Explainability, then Fairness and Equity and Accuracy. The strongest explained factor was Adoption Intention, which was described by Economic Viability and Perceived Scalability, and Trust was considered a significant mediator; the direct effect between Accuracy to Adoption was also low and positive. The model described moderate variation in important outcomes (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R} 2=.36$</tex> in Accuracy;. 29 in Trust;. 46 in Adoption Intention). The results suggest that scale requires accuracy but not enough, which is the combination of qualities of governance, such as transparent reasoning, fair distribution of burden, and plausible unit economics that transform the technical performance into the organizational commitment. The research also offers an empirically supported framework and validated tool to those municipalities that wish to implement HIL-AI wastesegregation in accurate, fair, and scalable ways."

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently been recognized as a promising enabler for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, owing to their ability to dynamically adapt antenna positions within a confined region. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), on the other hand, allows messages to be divided into common and private parts, which can significantly improve the user experience, especially in scenarios with diverse channel conditions. This advantage is particularly pronounced in FAS, where users can dynamically adjust their antennas for optimal performance. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a FAS-assisted RSMA communication system to utilize their synergistic benefits. We consider a scenario where a fixed base station (BS) transmits information to users equipped with a planar fluid antenna. We begin by deriving the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the effective channel at the user by utilizing copula theory to model the correlation between the channel fading coefficients. To gain more insights, delay outage rate (DOR) is derived. Simulation results demonstrates that the integration of RSMA and FAS leads to improved overall system performance compared to conventional single-input single-output (SISO) RSMA systems. The analytical expressions derived are validated through simulation results."

    "abstract": "As the core rotating component of an aeroengine, the rotor system directly determines the engine's reliability and flight safety. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt effective anomaly detection methods to monitor the rotor's operating condition. Typically, the vibration signal of the rotor is used as the key source of information for anomaly detection. However, fault data of aeroengine rotors under real operating conditions are extremely scarce, making it difficult to adequately train intelligent diagnostic models and thereby limiting the engineering application of rotor anomaly detection technology. In recent years, some studies have attempted to reduce the dependence on measured data by training models with a combination of simulated and measured data. However, significant differences in the information distribution between simulated and measured data lead to a substantial decline in the diagnostic accuracy of intelligent models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Physics Informed Temporal Convolutional Network with efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PITCN-eKAN) for anomaly detection of aeroengine rotor systems. The proposed model obtains the theoretical response output of the actual data by constructing a mechanism simulation model, which is adopted as the physical constraint in the data-driven model training process. A network framework guided by physical information is constructed to improve the fitting accuracy of the deep learning model with the theoretical output, thus achieving high-precision anomaly detection. The PITCN-eKAN model provides a new concept for the engineering application of intelligent diagnostic algorithms for aeroengine rotors."

In this work, rubber is proposed as an alternative substrate material because of its flexibility, conductivity, efficiency, ease of fabrication, and water resistance, making it suitable for Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications. The proposed antenna operates at 2.4 GHz with a relative permittivity (εr) of 3.0, a frequency commonly used for wearable devices. Two antenna designs, rectangular and circular microstrip patches, were developed, simulated, and analyzed using CST Microwave Studio (CST-MWS).

    "abstract": "Network traffic data is vital for network optimization, security, and other fields, but high-quality real data is scarce due to privacy and commercial constraints, making high-fidelity synthetic traffic generation critical for research and applications. Existing traffic generation methods often struggle to capture dynamic user intent at the application level, suffering from limitations like mode collapse or oversimplified feature modeling. Rule-based and GAN-based approaches, for instance, struggle to capture the complex interplay of behavioral patterns and network protocols, leading to low controllability and realism. This paper proposes BehDiffNet, a two-stage hierarchical diffusion model for behavior-aware network traffic generation to address these challenges. The model employs a dual-conditional generation mechanism (behavioral sequence conditioning and protocol constraint conditioning): the upper layer models user intent at the application layer by embedding application order, frequency and temporal semantics in behavioral sequences, and re-generates them through diffusion models and protocol constraints, while the lower layer integrates conditional bootstrapping through a two-branch transformer. Utilizing adversarial training and cross-feature attention, the model effectively captures temporal dependencies and multidimensional feature correlations. Experiments demonstrate that the model is more advantageous in terms of statistical alignment and protocol consistency compared to the baseline."

The model leverages a hierarchical Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework to capture correlations across element, time, and feature dimensions. A forecasting branch based on fully connected layers predicts future KPI values, while a reconstruction branch based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models historical behavior. Moreover, a Peaks Over Threshold (POT)-based statistical module is introduced to automatically determine dynamic detection thresholds.

This technique uses more filters and skips connections to improve segmentation, while the capsule network uses dynamic routing to preserve spatial hierarchies to improve classification. In the proposed model robust approach for breast cancer segmentation and classification using the CBIS-DDSIM dataset is presented. The proposed methodology employs the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm for clustering and segmenting breast cancer, followed by feature extraction through a combined convolutional neural network (CNN) + UNET model. These extracted features are then classified using Capsule-Net algorithms to identify images as benign or malignant, achieving an accuracy exceeding 96% on test data. The system is implemented as a web application comprising several modules. Users can upload the dataset, preprocess images, and extract features via FCM and CNN+UNET. The features are split into training and testing sets, where Capsule-Net algorithms are applied for model training and accuracy evaluation. Additionally, the application allows users to classify new test images, enhancing its practical utility for early breast cancer detection. It is observed by the proposed model that it has superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques such as CNN. Capsule-Net gives better performance than state-of-the-art techniques, which is shown using the Jaccard similarity score and dice score with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score used for performance analysis.

However, this approach comes with a drawback of large communication overhead, as both the intermediate weights for forward propagation and gradients for backpropagation need to be regularly communicated with the server.This paper presents an empirical evaluation of methods that have the potential to address the communication inefficiency of the SplitFed algorithm. In particular, we study Early Exit (EE) algorithms and their application in the context of SplitFed. In our empirical evaluation, we insert the EE at the last layer of the local client model and train this smaller model locally in tandem with the large model. We show that the communication overhead can be reduced even further by randomly sampling smaller subsets from the training set. We evaluate this approach on several deep model architectures across various datasets and demonstrate that this approach can significantly save on communication while maintaining the accuracy of the base model."

This challenge is further worsened in real-world applications by the lack of large-scale labeled training data, making single-sample face recognition a particularly difficult task. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning based method to tackle the masked face recognition with single sample per identity. The proposed method uses a two stage training strategy. In the first step,a contrastive learning framework is employed to learn discriminative feature representations by contrasting positive pairs (different augmentations of the same identity) against negative pairs (different identities). In the second stage, the learned representations are used to extract embeddings, which are subsequently classified using a lightweight supervised classifier. Experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised learning approach significantly enhances feature discrimination, leading to improved classification accuracy in downstream masked face recognition tasks. The experiment results confirm that contrastive learning is a key enabler in building resilient face recognition systems for constrained scenarios such as masked or partially occluded face inputs."

    "abstract": "In the context of constructing a new power system dominated by renewable energy, this paper addresses the core issue of discrepancies between theoretical assessments and practical realities in industrial load regulation capability. It proposes a city-level assessment method for industrial load power regulation capability. This method overcomes the limitations of traditional algebraic superposition by establishing a time-resolved analytical model that integrates real-time load fluctuations and historical operational features to accurately quantify the regulation potential of a single user. It innovatively introduces a confidence assessment mechanism using the dual parameters of user response willingness and communication reliability to effectively address the problem of uncertainty in industrial user response. The simulation case, based on a 6 -node network, validates the practicality of the model. It systematically reveals the regulation capacity of urban-scale industrial loads. This work provides a scientifically quantified basis for power grids to accurately tap into demand-side adjustable resources and enhance the accommodation of renewable energy. It holds significant engineering application value for alleviating power supplydemand tensions and promoting synergistic source-load interaction."

    "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are essential to smart city development, yet traditional control frameworks struggle to meet the demands of complex scenarios such as autonomous driving. Digital Twin (DT) technology emerges as a powerful solution by enabling virtual representations of physical entities to support real-time state estimation, predictive analysis, and coordinated decision-making. However, existing research often underestimates the high cost of DT synchronization and migration, and lacks coordinated update strategies across vehicles and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-granularity DT construction scheme that jointly optimizes synchronization strategies for both vehicles and road segments, while coordinating communication and computational resource allocation. We formulate a joint optimization problem that integrates vehicle DT deployment, adaptive road segment DT updating, and resource scheduling. This problem is decomposed into two interdependent subproblems, which are solved using a hybrid algorithm that combines heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) and block coordinate descent (BCD). Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme significantly enhances DT quality while reducing overall system costs."

    "abstract": "Omnidirectional images (ODIs) serve as fundamental visual medium for presenting virtual reality (VR) contents, supporting fully immersive experiences through 360-degree scene representation. Typically, a high pixel density is essential for visual quality in VR environments, which in turn requires sufficiently high-resolution imagery to achieve. However, capturing native high-resolution ODIs requires expensive omnidirectional cameras with large sensors (e.g., Insta360 TITAN). An alternative approach is to use low-resolution cameras to acquire original images and then enhance their resolution via super-resolution algorithms. In this work, we explore whether super-resolution ODIs can be easily distinguished from native high-resolution ODIs at 8K scale. To this end, we firstly construct the Native Resolution Assessment of 8K Omnidirectional Images (NRA- 8KODI) dataset, whose native 8K ODIs are collected with an Insta360 TITAN camera and 8K super-resolution images are generated from SOTA open-sourced algorithms. Recognizing high-frequency signals are essential for differentiating non-native 8K ODIs, a frequency-aware model is designed to capture high-frequency details. Specially, to maintain high-frequency details kept in high-resolutions while reduce computational costs brought by high-resolutions, we propose a frequency-aware compressor module to suppress feature channels dominated by low-frequency details. Finally, our model achieves 97.2% accuracy in detecting non-native 8K ODIs, implying that super-resolution for ODIs can still be improved for visual experience in VR applications."

The ability to accurately understand where traffic accidents may occur can assist authorities with preventative measures and improved management of the road system. This study investigates the spatio-temporal modeling of accident data in order to understand the relationships of location and time, along with external factors, to the occurrence of a traffic accident. By applying a spatial relationship across the road network and a temporal relationship based on traffic flow, weather, and other events, the proposed methodology identifies riskier locations with more confidence and trustworthiness. The importance of explainability in decision making for policy-makers, planning, and transportation is preserved which allows utilizing information on road accidents to enhance safety and reduce risk, especially for vulnerable road users. The experimental analysis shows hotspot detection is reliable across a variety of traffic scenarios. Results from the study help to understand the extent that spatio-temporal features help to reduce uncertainty of prediction. Findings can assist to provide improved safety for road infrastructure planning or targeted approaches planned specifically for intervention.

    "abstract": "Accurate quantification of biochemical components, such as protein content in agricultural products, via near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is often hindered by the scarcity of labeled samples. Under small-sample conditions, models confront three intertwined bottlenecks: aliasing of key absorption features caused by strong spectral coupling between components, prediction instability introduced by instrument noise and sample state variations, and the consequent decline in model discriminability and generalization capability. To systematically address these challenges, this paper proposes a Skip-Connected Symmetric Network (SkipSymNet), whose core innovation lies in the synergistic integration of physics-guided feature engineering and a skip-connected symmetric neural architecture. First, we introduce a feature engineering pipeline based on prior knowledge of spectral-protein correlations, extracting rich statistical and morphological features from predefined physicochemical absorption regions to explicitly enhance input representation and interpretability. Second, we design a symmetric encoder-decoder network as the core predictor. Equipped with bidirectional information flow and hierarchical skip connections, it simultaneously preserves low-level spectral details and high-level contextual features, thereby improving training stability under small-sample conditions. Experiments conducted on a public wheat protein NIR dataset demonstrate that SkipSymNet consistently outperforms classical chemometric methods and representative deep learning baselines. Compared with the best-performing baseline method OMP-BVS, SkipSymNet increased R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> from 0.9438 to 0.9536 and reduced RMSE from 0.4125 to 0.3750 on an independent test set, achieving relative improvements of 1.03% in R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and 9.1% in RMSE reduction.

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are difficult to detect and classify accurately because their shape, size, and appearance can vary widely in MRI scans. Early and precise identification is extremely important for planning treatment and improving patient outcomes. However, manually examining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires a lot of time and expertise, which can increase the chances of error. To overcome these limitations, this work presents an automatic diagnosis system for brain-tumor classification. The proposed model uses a transfer learning approach to extract meaningful features of MRI images using the EfficientNetV2-B0. To strengthen these MRI cues, an attention model is incorporated in the baseline model, and later, the enhanced feature map is passed to the softmax layer through a pooling layer for final classification. The proposed model is validated on a brain tumor image dataset, which includes cases such as Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. The validation results show that the proposed framework achieves the best accuracy and outperforms traditional deep learning models."

This study attempts to create a radar-based fall detection system that uses 3D point cloud data and a deep learning approach based on PointNet. The primary focus is to address challenges such as limited dataset size, noise, and fluctuations in the number of points at each timestamp. These challenges are addressed through a pre-processing pipeline that includes augmentation, noise cleaning (ADBSCAN), data standardization (Moving Block Bootstrap), and temporal segmentation (sliding window). Classification is performed using the PointNet architecture, which directly processes point clouds. Based on testing results, the system achieved an accuracy of 99.97 %, with 0 False Positives and 2 False Negatives. Recall was 100% for ‘not_fall’ and 99.80% for ‘fall’. This excellent performance, especially the high recall across classes and zero False Positives, demonstrates the system's reliability and significant potential for accurate, non-intrusive elderly fall detection."

    "abstract": "The increasing digitization of library services has not always been accompanied by intelligent features that support personalized access to resources. Many community libraries still rely on static catalogs and keyword-based searches, which often fail to guide users efficiently toward relevant reading materials. This gap highlights the need for smarter, data-driven solutions to enhance book discovery and user engagement. This study aims to develop and integrate a web-based book recommendation system for a community library using item-based collaborative filtering. The system leverages historical borrowing data to compute item similarities, allowing for personalized suggestions in two main scenarios: when users view a specific book and when accessing the dashboard. The development follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, encompassing problem identification, system design, implementation, demonstration, and evaluation. The recommendation model was evaluated using Precision@K and Recall@K metrics, with results showing high precision for small recommendation sets (e.g., Precision@3 = 0.9412) and improved recall as the number of recommendations increased (e.g., Recall@10 = 0.8415). These findings suggest that the model achieves a practical balance between relevance and breadth. The study concludes that item-based collaborative filtering is an effective approach for enhancing book discovery in library settings. The system contributes to the development of intelligent digital infrastructure in community libraries, supporting more personalized and engaging user experiences."

A one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to identify arrhythmias while a fully connected network served for CAD prediction. The models reached 96.2 % accuracy in arrhythmia detection and 92 % accuracy in CAD binary prediction after training on multiple benchmark datasets with advanced preprocessing and augmentation methods. The models were integrated into a cloud-based E-hospital platform to provide real-time analysis, electronic medical record (EMR) connectivity, and remote access capabilities.

    "abstract": "Underfill encapsulation is commonly used to enhance the reliability of flip-chip and ball grid array (BGA) in electronic package assembly. However, prolonged filling, incomplete filling and void formation remain significant challenges of the capillary underfill process in the packaging industry. Apart from the conventional single dispensing inlet (Itype), double dispensing inlets (L-type) and triple dispensing inlets (U-type), this paper explores the feasibility of cornerfill to achieve desired filling coverage and within a reasonably short filling time. The underfilling process of a BGA package subjected to dispensing at corners is numerically simulated using ANSYS Fluent. Four different cornerfill dispensing paths are studied: 2 mm for both short and long sides, 1 mm (short side) +3 mm (long side), 3 mm (short side) +1 mm (long side) and corner dot dispensing. Qualitative comparison of the ANSYS Fluent simulated filling coverages of BGA package with the experimental cross section and Moldex3D simulated findings at the end of corner fill process show good agreement to each other. It is found that the asymmetrical dispensing with 3 mm path at the long side of package yield highest filling coverage of 71%; while having a longer dispensing path at the short side of the package gave a relative uniform flow front. The dot dispensing at the corner, however, yields a qualitatively similar filling profile as the symmetry dispensing path. This study showed that the filling rate and coverage of cornerfill process are dependent on the dispensing path. As a generalization, the package side that is perpendicular to the direction of least ball rows (i.e. the long side of the package) should be subjected with a longer dispensing path."

Specifically, by considering finite energy, varying power consumption, and network throughput, we derive the closed-form expressions for lifetime throughput and achieve optimal energy efficiency by tuning the access probability. The analysis indicates that when data traffic is sporadic, the optimal channel access probability aligns with the right endpoint of the unsaturated region. Maintaining the access probability at this optimal point significantly minimizes energy wastage, balances network throughput, and reduces contention. These findings provide valuable insights into the configuration of access parameters for achieving high energy efficiency in CSMA-based LR-WPANs."

Each alert requires flight maneuvers, sensing, and data transmission, that works based on learned priorities from task types. Alerts are queued in a buffer and can expire based on their priority cycle. The system uses MAB-UCB to maximize its reward for each selection. In this paper, the results of the MAB-UCB approach is compared with the traditional algorithms, that showcases significant improvements in selection policy. The simulation study also reveals a systemic processing bottleneck, a key finding which highlights that even an optimal agent is constrained by system capacity. Furthermore, the results shows that the agent successfully identifies high-risk geographical zones and critical time windows. It also demonstrates the ability of the presented work to uncover valuable operational intelligence from raw alert data."

    "abstract": "The Temporary Bonding and Debonding (TBDB) process plays a pivotal role in 2.5D/3.0 D integration for thin and fragile wafers to be securely supported during aggressive backend processing steps such as thinning, through-silicon via (TSV) formation, and interconnect creation. In 2.5D integration usually multiple dies are mounted on an interposer with different pitch (spacing), and in 3.0D stacking vertical integration through TSVs is employed with certain pitch (spacing between chips or stacks). Temporary bonding materials must exhibit strong adhesion during hightemperature and high-stress processes, yet allow clean, residuefree debonding under control conditions (mechanical, thermal slide, laser release, or chemical methods). This paper explores the impact of chip spacing on the outcome of temporary bonding and debonding (TBDB) processes for chip to wafer (C2W) hybrid bonding integration. Debonding and cleaning modules were optimized using 0.5mm, 1.0 mm and 10.2 mm spaced chips bonded wafer. Results demonstrate that the spacing between chips significantly influences the effectiveness of final debonding and the successful removal of glue residues, highlighting a critical factor for optimized 3D integration."

This paper proposes a comprehensive framework integrating digital twin simulation and generative AI algorithms to address data insufficiency in renewable energy equipment defect identification. First, a novel data augmentation method combining TimeGAN (Time-series Generative Adversarial Network) and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is developed to enhance both the quantity and diversity of defect samples, achieving a sample diversity coefficient improvement from 23.7% to 89.6%. Second, a multi-physics digital twin model integrating aerodynamic, mechanical, and electrical subsystems is constructed to simulate high-fidelity fault data across multiple failure modes including short circuits, open circuits, overvoltage, and vibration anomalies. Third, a Stacking ensemble learning model is proposed to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple intelligent algorithms, enhancing robustness and high-dimensional data processing capability. The proposed defect identification model achieves an average accuracy of 94.0%, representing a significant improvement over the baseline accuracy of 92.3%. Finally, an intelligent operation and maintenance solution integrating a knowledge base and intelligent search functionality is implemented to provide refined equipment maintenance guidance. Field deployment demonstrates a 68.7% reduction in annual average unplanned outages compared to industry benchmarks, validating the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework in large-scale renewable energy operations."

The developed workflow includes data cleaning, case folding, stemming, feature extraction using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and class balancing on the training data using Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE). Three base models were evaluated: Random Forest, C4.5, and Naive Bayes. These models were then combined using two ensemble strategies, Hard Voting and Soft Voting. The classification task involved five levels of anxiety: Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Very Severe. The evaluation used accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. Results showed that C4.5 achieved the best baseline performance with approximately 87% accuracy, followed by Random Forest and Naive Bayes, each with around 83% accuracy. The use of ensemble methods consistently improved classification performance. Soft Voting reached an accuracy of 0.88 with macro precision, recall, and F1 score each at 0.88. Meanwhile, Hard Voting achieved the highest performance with 0.89 accuracy, 0.90 macro precision, 0.89 recall, and 0.89 F1 score. The confusion matrix analysis indicated that the Severe and Very Severe classes were classified accurately, while the Moderate class remained the most challenging to distinguish, often overlapping with Mild or Normal. These findings confirm that voting-based ensemble strategies are effective for narrative-based anxiety classification and can serve as a reliable method for early mental health screening in academic environments."

The present research makes use of advanced deep learning methods in the classification of skin lesions based on the ISIC 2019 dataset, which is made up of 25,331 dermoscopic pictures representing eight diagnostic categories. To improve the performance of the model and to deal with the class imbalance issue, extensive preprocessing procedures such as image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation were carried out on the images. The dataset was divided into three parts: training (80 %), validation (10 %), and testing (10 %) to allow for a stringent model evaluation. Three prominent pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures-MobileNetV2, Xception, and DenseNet-were implemented and fine-tuned using Adam and RMSprop optimization algorithms. Among these, MobileNetV2 exhibited superior classification performance, attaining an initial accuracy of 96 %, subsequently enhanced to 99 % through systematic hyperparameter tuning. The close alignment between training and validation accuracies suggests effective mitigation of overfitting and underfitting. This investigation advances AI-based dermatological diagnostics by evidencing the capability of deep learning models to manage imbalanced datasets and achieve high classification accuracy, thereby contributing to more reliable and efficient clinical decision support systems."

    "abstract": "With the accelerating global energy transition, photovoltaic-storage-charging integrated stations (PVSCIS) have emerged as a key solution for enhancing renewable energy utilization and facilitating the low-carbon transformation of the transportation sector. However, the capacity planning of PVSCIS is challenged by the randomness of photovoltaic generation, variability in electric vehicle charging demand, and degradation of energy storage systems. Ignoring these factors may result in suboptimal capacity configurations, leading to resource inefficiencies and supply inadequacies. This paper proposes a capacity planning model for PVSCIS that accounts for source-load uncertainty and battery aging effects. A stochastic scenario generation method, combining Monte-Carlo simulation with backward synchronous iteration, is employed to characterize the source-load uncertainty. Comparative simulations under different energy storage modeling strategies and uncertainty conditions validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results indicate that incorporating battery degradation mechanisms and source-load uncertainty into the investment optimization process significantly improves system robustness and stabilizes lifecycle economic performance, providing valuable insights for the sustainable deployment of integrated energy systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC), catalyzed by frameworks such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), has fundamentally reshaped the global trade landscape, introducing unprecedented market opportunities alongside profound operational complexities. This paradigm shift is characterized by non-stationary demand environments where consumer preferences exhibit high volatility, logistics chains are elongated and stochastic, and the coupling between demand generation and supply fulfillment remains historically brittle. Traditional decision-making paradigms often treat consumer recommendation and inventory control as decoupled silos, leading to suboptimal outcomes such as the simultaneous occurrence of stockouts for high-velocity items and the obsolescence of long-tail inventory. This research proposes a novel, closed-loop supply-demand collaborative mechanism designed to navigate these complexities. On the demand side, we construct a high-precision user profiling system utilizing a Multimodal PinSAGE architecture. This incorporates DistilBERT for semantic extraction from multilingual product descriptions and EfficientNet for high-fidelity visual feature learning, fused via a random-walk-based graph convolutional network to capture complex, high-order user-item interactions. On the supply side, we develop a Multi-Objective Soft Actor-Critic (MO-SAC) reinforcement learning agent responsible for dynamic inventory optimization. This agent operates within an entropy-regularized framework to balance exploration and exploitation amidst demand volatility, optimizing for profit maximization, service level maintenance, and holding cost minimization simultaneously. By mathematically coupling these subsystems, the framework enables a real-time synchronization where recommendation algorithms actively promote stockavailable items to shape demand, while inventory policies proactively adjust replenishment orders based on aggregated algorithmic engagement signals. Extensive empirical experiments on the Amazon-M2 and Taobao User Behavior datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior Recall@10 and NDCG@10 metrics while reducing total inventory costs by approximately 29% under simulated RCEP logistics conditions."

RIE plasma treatments were found to progressively increase bonding strength with longer exposure times, due to subsurface ion-induced damage that facilitates water uptake and subsequent silanol-to-siloxane conversion. In contrast, Remote plasma treatments promote surface hydroxylation, enhancing initial bonding strength, but extended exposure reduces bonding efficacy by diminishing surface -OH density. Incorporation of low-k layers beneath the bonding dielectric further improves bonding strength by enabling controlled moisture absorption and enhancing siloxane network formation, particularly in thinner and more porous upper dielectric layers. Dense dielectrics limit this effect due to restricted water diffusion. These results reveal a complex interplay between surface chemistry, plasma-induced subsurface modifications, and bulk moisture properties, offering actionable insights for the design of dielectric stacks and plasma activation strategies to achieve mechanically robust W 2 W and D 2 W bonds."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks has elicited demand for intelligent routing solutions to balance traffic loads and enhance quality of service (QoS). However, constrained by the inability to systematically collect and process routing information for building supervised training databases, most existing methods rely on reinforcement learning approaches that assume a fixed number of satellites and a stable training environment, which need to reset state space and retrain model when encountering contingencies such as satellite failures. To improve the generalization capability of satellite routing, this paper innovatively proposes a structured approach for processing satellite communication information and a framework for feasible routing in LEO constellations via communicationaware attention, named Attentive Routing. This framework structurally encodes communication information, employs a communication-aware attention encoder to extract topological communication hotspot patterns, and utilizes a feasible satellite routing decoder to directly generate routing paths across different LEO topologies. For dynamic satellite quantity changes, we design multilevel embedding and positional encoding to serialize satellite topology and communication quality metrics into model inputs. Performance refinement is achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Environment (RLE), which continuously fine-tunes Attentive Routing using feedback from OMNeT++ simulations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate its capability to generate adaptive paths across varying satellite network topologies, which increases total throughput by approximately 5.5 %, reduces average end-to-end delay by at least 20 %, and improves bandwidth satisfaction by 27.5 %, all while maintaining an exceptionally low packet loss rate."

    "abstract": "The stochastic nature of wind power poses challenges to power system planning. Accurate extraction of typical wind power scenarios is fundamental for optimizing energy storage and ensuring grid stability. While K-means is widely used, its performance is highly dependent on the pre-determined cluster number and random initial centroids, often leading to sub-optimal results. Furthermore, pre-clustering algorithms like Canopy rely on subjectively defined thresholds. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an improved K-means algorithm based on a density-weighted Canopy (DWC-Kmeans). This method introduces a density-weighting mechanism to automatically identify high-density data points as initial cluster centers. This approach adaptively determines the optimal cluster number and initial centroids, circumventing the arbitrary threshold settings. The proposed algorithm is validated using one year of measured output data from a 30MW wind farm. The clustering performance is quantitatively evaluated using the Silhouette Coefficient, Sum of Squared Errors, and the Davies-Bouldin Index. Results demonstrate that the proposed DWC-Kmeans algorithm significantly outperforms both the traditional K-means and the standard Canopy-Kmeans algorithms across all three metrics. The method provides an accurate, stable, and objective approach for extracting wind power scenarios, offering a robust data foundation for power system planning."

Although promising results have been achieved with automated detection methods, progress is limited due to the scarcity of labeled data and significant variability in speech patterns from speaker to speaker. In this paper, we present an active learning-powered data-efficient framework for dysarthria detection. Our approach avoids direct labeling efforts on large datasets; instead, the system repeatedly selects a batch of the samples it is most uncertain about and asks only for their annotation. Starting with a small labeled set, the model is gradually improved by adding high-uncertainty examples from a larger unlabeled pool, reducing the labeling effort while boosting accuracy. Our experiments show that this uncertainty-guided strategy can indeed yield strong performance with far fewer labeled samples, taking a practical step toward scalable and clinically usable dysarthria detection tools."

    "abstract": "Medical imaging offers essential insights into internal anatomical structures and disease progression. Contrast agents are commonly used to enhance image quality and improve diagnostic accuracy, but they may impose significant renal burdens, especially in patients with impaired kidney function. Diffusion models (DMs) have recently shown strong performance in medical image translation. However, conventional DMs rely on static guidance from the source image and often lose critical structural details during the forward diffusion, which are hard to fully recover. This limitation can result in anatomical distortion and diagnostic errors. We propose a Frequency-guided Recursive Diffusion Bridge Model (FRDBM) to address this issue. Unlike standard DMs, FRDBM defines the diffusion path between the source and target images and incorporates frequency-domain information to preserve structural fidelity. Our approach enables the generation of contrast-enhanced images from non-contrast ones, potentially avoiding the use of contrast agents. Experiments on MRI contrast enhancement demonstrate that FRDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving fine-grained anatomical details and diagnostic image quality, with quantitative metrics (PSNR: 29.775 dB on BraTs; SSIM: 0.917) surpassing all competing methods."

Although artificial intelligence based imaging methods in previous studies can partially solve these issues, they typically require large amounts of training data, which is hard to be obtained in wireless imaging scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a new imaging method using transfer learning (TL). Specifically, we first train the neural network (NN) on a large synthetic dataset and fine-tune it using a small number of human images. We respectively employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional NN (CNN), and a U-NET to realize human imaging, where their performances are extensively compared. Simulation results reveal that our proposed method can achieve effective imaging of human body based on limited training data, even when considering multipath interference. We find CNNs exhibit better TL performance compared to MLPs."

    "abstract": "The distributed access with single-phase and uncertain generation of renewable energy increases the risk of voltage unbalance limit violations in distribution network. With the increasing penetration of renewable energy generation, it is important to study how to mitigate the impacts of intermittent renewable energy generation on the risk of voltage unbalance limit violation in distribution network. This paper proposes a shared energy storage allocation strategy and optimal operation method based on global sensitivity analysis (GSA). First, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) based probabilistic voltage unbalance factor calculation model for distribution network is constructed, and the risk index of distribution network probabilistic voltage unbalance factor limit violation is defined. It can quickly and accurately quantify the impacts of uncertain renewable energy generation on the risk of voltage unbalance limit violation in distribution network. Then, a GSA method based on Wasserstein distance is proposed to identify the critical renewable energy sources affecting distribution network voltage unbalance. Finally, the GSA-based shared energy storage allocation strategy and the rolling prediction optimization-based operation method of shared energy storage are proposed. Simulation results on the IEEE 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the maximum probabilistic voltage unbalance exceedance risk by over 74 % compared to the case without energy storage. The rolling optimization operation effectively smooths renewable power fluctuations, validating the practical efficacy of the method in enhancing distribution network security. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through the simulation analysis of IEEE 123 bus distribution network."

This study introduces a real-time anomaly detection framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accurately identify APT activities throughout their attack lifecycle. Unlike conventional detection models, the proposed system continuously learns normal network behavior and flags unusual patterns linked to reconnaissance, lateral movement, data theft, and initial compromise. A custom-built dataset capturing different APT behaviors, along with associated tactics, techniques, and indicators of compromise (IoCs), was used for model training and testing. The GAN design features a generator that replicates normal network traffic and a discriminator that identifies malicious deviations in real time. Through this adversarial learning process, the model effectively recognizes complex patterns and distinguishes between legitimate and suspicious activities. Experimental evaluations show that the model delivers high accuracy in detecting subtle and evolving APT attacks. By enabling real-time monitoring and full-stage threat coverage, this approach provides a reliable and scalable solution for proactive cybersecurity defense."

The obtained formulas for calculating the eigenfrequencies of CVG with a metal cylindrical resonator have been experimentally confirmed in practice by the acoustic method. The results of spectral analysis of a single impact on the resonator showed the splitting of the resonant frequency into two components with peaks of 5781.05 Hz and 5787.53 Hz. The non-ideal geometry of the cylinder causes this splitting. The results of the experimental study on the real split resonant frequency and Q-factor demonstrate the importance of considering the non-ideal resonator for the accuracy of modeling its dynamic characteristics. The results of modeling the movement of the CVG are presented, which demonstrate a significant impact on the characteristics of the oscillating system not only of the different frequencies, but also of its phases relative to the excitation axis X and the measurement axis Y. Assessment of the influence of multi-frequency on the properties of the CVG as an angular velocity sensor indicates the possibility of using this influence in the CVG control system. It is demonstrated that the use of the CVG control system in scanning mode for multi-frequency resonator characteristics has found practical application in CVG balancing operations, specifically in identifying and removing unbalanced resonator masses."
